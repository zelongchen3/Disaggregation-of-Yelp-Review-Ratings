0,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Firstly, this restaurant is in The Linq Hotel, formerly The Quad. Expect a line. Waited only about 15 minutes to be seated, though. Greeted by Tony our waiter who was really warm, friendly, sincere, and knowledgeable. Ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Massive is an understatement! The only thing is that it came out kind of lukewarm. But the problem was rectified REALLY fast! Tony put in an order for fresh chicken. Then the manager Eric came and asked if everything was okay. He was a class act-very attentive, friendly, and responsive. I explained what happened. The next thing you know lickety split...new fresh hot plate hand delivered by Eric in 2 minutes! Problem solved! The chicken and waffles were really tasty! The sweet and savory is a great combo. My girlfriend and I shared the plate and STILL had leftovers!!  Late night munchies-problem solved!!
Thank you Eric and Tony for making our experience nothing short of wonderful!"
1,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place had monsterous proportions OMG! One plate could feed 4 people! It was a very unique menu! I had the chorizo hash YUM! Also try the peach Long Island yum! And you get to keep the crazy glass!
2,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place freaking rocks. Must go to when in Vegas. Get the Tractor Combo. The pancake is bigger than the large plate itself.
3,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Visited HHAGG ago go for the first time on 5/5/14. The reviews on Yelp were numerous, and everyone seemed to love this place. Although we didn't go at a typical busy dinner time (I believe it was around 4:30), it was still a 45 minute wait to get in. Claims of the huge portion sizes were not off base. We saw many huge plates filled with food go by as we were sitting there waiting to order. What was obvious early on were the trees growing out of each of the big plates food. These are apparently big sprigs of sage, so if you're not fond of sage, ask them to hold it.

I had the grilled portobello sandwich, substitute the goat cheese for cheddar. Watching all these big plates of food go by, I was anticipating a large portobello grilled mushroom cap with the toppings dripping off of it, but this is not what I got. It was a puny mushroom cap on a typical grocery store 8-pack type burger roll and they put the goat cheese on it anyway and didn't add the cheddar. The Waitress was very nice and offered to bring it back and make a new one, but we had already waited too long and my husband's food was ready to eat. He had a burger that was very good, but to be honest I don't remember what kind it was. My mushroom was dry and I had to add mayo to moisten it up (not something I would typically do), it was ok - nothing I would order again though."
4,Hash House A Go Go,3,Big portions. Sharing is highly recommended. Had the chicken and waffles. Wasn't really impressed.
5,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food was awesome! The service was great. We arrived late but they were still serving dinner. If you go you have to try the cornbread with bacon in it!! I would definitely recommend this place to others nd I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!
6,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Review for early dinner (5:30p) on a Saturday, 4 people.

Note: these are ginormous portions!

Food:
- small plate of crab cake (1 piece) and pasta: it was filling for me; portion is like a regular size entree (and I was hungry).
- chicken and waffles: it can feed 2 hungry people! Waffles stayed crisp.
- Apple pancake: size of the entire plate. Again this can be shared with 2 or 3 people. 
- burger: it was a double patty. Again, share-able for 2 people.
- watermelon, kiwi lemonade (I think that was the combo): refreshing, looks beautiful when they bring it out! You just have to stir it all together to have the full effect of the non-alcoholic drink. :)

Coming back?: for sure! Just have to share all the food! :)"
7,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've been wanting to come here for such a long time now after a friend recommended this place to me. I finally had the oppourtiny this last weekend and I was very pleased. We went around 11:00am for a later breakfast and surprisingly only had a 15 minute wait. Our server was on top of it as she immediately took our drink order when were seated. I decided to go with their chorizo hash, after rave reviews on Yelp. It was a perfectly sized portion with so much flavor. Everyone else on my party enjoyed their meals. However, the highlight for me was their chocolate s'mores coffee, it was like dessert in a cup. Overall we really enjoyed their food and customer service, will definitely be back  during our next Vegas trip."
8,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm pretty enthused with this place: chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, passable coffeee.  Very delicious food in Las Vegas inside the Imperial Hotel.  This place is the closest to our room, and there was no wait at 9:30 a.m. on Memorial Day morning.  Pretty wonderful food; my wife loved the french toast.  

I tried a mocha smore drink the day before which looked pretty but tasted pretty toxic, so I can't go with five stars.  

Wonderful service, friendly staff, great people-watching!"
9,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hands down the BEST BLT sandwich I've ever had!!!!! 

Came here late one night with a couple friends after a show. We were tired, hungry, and staying upstairs at the LINQ so we decided to stop by for a quick late night bite. When I first walked in, I kind of expected it to be like any other basic American-style food diner. Sort of like Denny's. However, I was pleasantly surprised by all of the atypical diner food options they offered! 

We all got the BBBLT (a take on the BLT but with extra bacon). It comes with a side of choice. My boyfriend and I shared the plate with a side of salad. The salad was alright- they didn't have many choices for dressings. The sandwich was HUGE and it did come with a nice serving size of bacon but I wouldn't call it 3x the amount of a usual BLT. The bacon was cooked incredibly well! Tasty and crunchy. 

I can't really say much else about the meal without being repetitive. But I wish we could've stopped by one last time before we checked out! 

The service was very good. The host was welcoming and sat us quickly. He also came by with our drinks and refills on water. The server was friendly and attentive. I don't have much else to say based off of just one experience. Just come by and try it for yourself!!"
10,Hash House A Go Go,4,Bumping to four stars.. the food is just too good and elevates this place to the next level. Cell service is still non-existent and the wifi situation has not improved either (this IS within the restaurant's control). Chicken Benedict really is one of the best things I've ever eaten.
11,Hash House A Go Go,4,My boyfriend and I had a great breakfast here. The vanilla waffles were super moist. It's noisy and loud but that's to be expected. It is Vegas after all.  You should definitely give this place a try--a great treat from the treacherous heat!
12,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Long wait..id actually say maybe go around 1ish-2ish..seems like that's when it starts to die down. Food was great! When we walked in and sat down we noticed the table next to us and their huge plates! Like huge!! So we decided to share 4 things for our party of 5. Of course we ordered the chicken and waffles and I swear I could've ate it all bymyself. It was really good with the bacon in the waffle!  Pancake was huge!! We got the one with snickers but wished we had tried the brown sugar banana one. The hash was fresh corn beef and the stuffed burgers were also good.

Service was also great! Like how all the workers there have like this cool rocker vibe."
13,Hash House A Go Go,5,Absolutely  worth  it.  The breakfast  was so large that I had to share it with the hubby.  We ordered a  side hash it was real cornbeef shredded  and moist.  Add some mustard and your good to go.
14,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I read a bunch of reviews before I came here and decided to go with the chicken and waffles. When I got to the restaurant, I saw all of the pictures of the celebs on the wall with their reviews about how great this dish was. BAM... that solidified my decision! The chicken was crispy and the best part was finding bacon pieces in my waffle. Anyone who knows me knows bacon is the way to my heart. My boyfriend had the chicken pot pie. It was the best looking dish on the table and soooo tasty! My best friend had the tuna melt, which we learned was not a sandwich, but more like a salad and let me tell you, it was soooo delicious! I will definitely be thinking of this place the next time I plan  trip to Vegas or San Diego."
15,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After deplaning and being hungry, my husband and I decided to make this our first stop since we were staying at the Harrah's next door.  We had heard of the famous chicken and bacon waffles here so we decided to get that and a house salad.  For the house salad, we were expecting a small itty bitty side salad, but this was big! it was definitely worth it and the croutons weren't croutons, it had the consistency of maybe a slightly hard piece of biscuit, but delicious!! the cucumber dressing was really good as well--- 

the chicken and waffles was massivE! as shown on many pictures posted, it did not disappoint. chicken was juicy and good and the bacon waffles were well cooked and just overall yummy.  

I am subtracting a star for service.  not very attentive and just kinda weird.  there was a 40 minute wait and when we were seated, the dining area we were in was half empty. sooooo, get more workers hash house!! i am looking forward to their reno location which is 2 hours from my home and i can get my fix more often!"
16,Hash House A Go Go,5,must go stop in las vegas if you are a foodie! no need to write a long review just go that's it!
17,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Never, ever Will I eat anywhere BUT the Has Has Go go in Vegas. Tucked inside the now trendy LINQ Hotel (which by the way has taken tremendous strides in renovation). This joint is indeed OPEN 24 hours 7 Days a week... Yes, You heard right. DO NOT OVER- ORDER. Bring an appetite, skip the appetizers because you will be more than accommodated with a deep fried FEAST of a meal.

  Try the Sage Chicken & Waffles dish & the Watermelon drink which can be ordered virgin... why pay for top shelf when you can head to the casino for $Free.99 drinks galore :) 

  Anywhoo, this place a gem! I took a pic with Martha Stewart, well, with Martha's picture hanging on the wall. Be prepared for a long wait, roughly about 45 minutes on a busy Sunday morning BUT It's worth it. I repeat, it's WORTH IT. Both of our meals, plus spiked Watermelon Drinks were barely 40 bucks. can't beat that in the Sin City"
18,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Tried this place again.

Fast & friendly service.

Chicken & waffles was bomb.  Fried leek  were really flavorful.

Had a side of sausage (very tasty and not very fatty).
Had the tractor's combo.  Pancakes were fluffy and huge.

Love this place.  Definitely a foodie must try."
19,Hash House A Go Go,5,HUGE PORTIONS!! You've been warned. Lol.  And they give you huge biscuits beforehand for free. We got 3 dishes for 5 people and didn't finish. Favorite was the blackened chicken with mashed pumpkin.  My mom's favorite was sage fried chicken and bacon waffles.  Dad liked it all. Lol.
20,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You can never go wrong here. The portions are gigantic. Hungover or not, it hits the spot. Make sure to try the Andy Sage fried chicken as you will crave this meal everyday from now on. I promise you"
21,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Let's start by saying this place is serious!  Strap on your appetites boys!!

We ordered the famous Sage Chicken Benedict and The Corned Beef Hash plate.  Most people rave about the Sage Chicken plates so I will let you read their reviews.  I'm so sad that I ordered the Sage Chicken when all I wanted to eat was the Corn Beef Hash plate that sat across the table from me.  I mean the savory flavors that I dream about were not right in front of me.  Seasoned potatoes, red onions, swiss cheese, chives and this corn beef that was amazing.  


This is the place that I have wet dreams about!"
22,Hash House A Go Go,5,unbelievable! try to the sage sausage gravy and eggs!
23,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I had heard so much good stuff about Hash House A Go Go and couldn't wait to try here.  Unfortunately my first experience did not live up to the hype.  The service was great, but what I ordered was not.  I was really excited seeing everyone else in the place getting their big plates of food.  My mouth was actually salivating waiting to get my meal.  What I discovered is that I ordered the wrong thing on the menu.  My entrÃ©e looked terrible compared to everything else I saw.  I had ordered the Reuben sandwich with fries, and it was one of the funkiest tasting sandwiches I have ever eaten.  It tasted like bad pot roast on toasted, buttered slices of bread.  It was so inedible that I could only stomach about half of it.  I was super hungry when I got here, but I lost my appetite eating the sandwich.  The fries were okay, and were mainly what I filled up on.

I heard the waiter tell someone that everything on the menu is good.  Not true!  The Reuben sucks!  Don't get it!  However, everything else looks good and I still want to give Hash House A Go Go another shot to see if it is really worthy of the hype."
24,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Just had our first experience here and it was very poor. We waited 40 minutes for a table, 30 minutes for our food and 20 minutes to check out (after explaining we were tight on time). After disappointing food and service, we would not go back."
25,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go is completely Vegas.

Everything is bigger and better and visually stimulating. The portions are beyond big...they are massive. The restaurant is on its own floor. The place is always packed and you wait and wait for your food. We probably waited over an hour for a single dish....but at least the Bloody Marys are wonderful. Bacon sea salt on the rim is fantastic! 

Service was horrible. They exhumed bitchiness. It really didn't kill the experience though. The food was what it was about here. 

We ordered the Smoked Salmon Farm Benedict. Its starts with grilled mash potatoes, an amazingly soft and yet crunchy biscuit, shredded salmon, crushed red peppers, spinach, and two eggs. All covered in chili cream sauce and asparagus spears. We couldn't even eat half of it. 

Vegas and gluttony at its finest."
26,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must go to every time we are in Vegas. The pancakes are the bomb. The banana brown sugar one is where it's at! I've had dinner and brunch, and everything has been good-but always wish i would just get the pancakes! 
Love the bloody Mary's!
Try to share plates-it's just so much food. Three people
Could honestly share one entree"
27,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome Awesome...

My husband and I went here and was presently surprised that the escalator ride up to the resturant is like entering a completely different dimension than the casino in the Imperial... The menu is decadent from start to finish, the portion sizes are huge, food is tasty...Kudos to the Mimosas!

I ordered the french toast and he ordered the chix and waffles. Awesome Awesome! My suggestion is to come hungry and with a group because you may want to share.. There was a wait but it was well worth it!"
28,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food is decent. The portions are huge. I had the crab Benedict and it's enough for a small army. Asparagus that comes with it was good, but the biscuits were too heavy for my taste."
29,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is seriously amazing after a lengthy wait due to our large party we were seated I ordered a blt mary.  Nothing like getting a sandwich inside your drink ...you must be patient especially if you have a bigger table but everything is 100% worth it hands down one of the best places I've ever been to !!!
30,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Don't go there if you have other choice, they make you wait an hour when there are many tables availeble, food is really bad too"
31,Hash House A Go Go,1,Went here on Monday for a birthday brunch for my girlfriend and our entire party (8 people) came down with food poisoning!!!!!!  Ruined our trip to Vegas!!! Never eating here EVER AGAIN!!
32,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place has HUGE portions and the food is great! My husband got the tractor tire pancake and it's huge! The Bloody Mary's were flavorful and the ""large"" mimosa is very large and comes in a leg cup"
33,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We are fans and when we're in Vegas...we're making a stop just for Hash House. We were staying at the LINQ, so it was really convenient for us. We didn't know what to expect. We were a group of 3 and we got in right away, which was really surprising. When we left, there was quite the line. The earlier, the better. I ordered the Trucker's Special, which included one of their giant pancakes (it's literally the size of two plates!) and it came with eggs and sausage/bacon. The price wasn't bad, it's pretty reasonable. I also ordered their Famous Smore's Mocha...best decision ever. It's $8.99, but oh my is it good. My husband and our friend ordered some skillet scrambles and they loved them, no complaints at all. All of their stuff is fresh and their homemade strawberry jam is to die for. They also have some signature ""hard"" drinks, as well as nitrogen brewed coffees and freshly squeezed juice. If you're in the area, definitely try this place!"
34,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Well after making sure to avoid the restaurant nearby sponsored by one Guy Le Douche (I mean Fieri) we made our way to Hash House A Go Go.

The portions at this place are massive and they love to stick giant branches of rosemary into your food - that's cool I guess.

Anyway, this place is good ol comfort food done right.  Meatloaf was delicious, mashed potatoes nice and whipped. It hit the spot...  For once I found a place that didn't seem overpriced and under flavored like most of the more affordable options on or near the strip.

My only regret is that entire half of a meatloaf sandwich went to waste since the refrigerator in my hotel room was too damn small to fit all our food in - ugh."
35,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Don't come if you are in a hurry. 45 minutes to get seated and 30 minutes more to get food after placing the order. This is a popular place and is packed. Luckily they make great Bloody Mary's that can make the long waits bearable.

I had the fried chicken Benedict hash which is one of their specials. BEWARE, they do scrambled eggs rather than poached eggs which makes this anything but Benedict IMHO.  Also, it LOOKED BETTER than it tasted. Trying a signature dish, I expect to be wowed. The only wow on this dish was the portion size. 

My wife had one of their scrambles and it was nothing special either. 

We won't be returning or recommending it to friends."
36,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Probably one of the cheaper places to eat in Las Vegas.

We came in on a Wednesday morning and there was a 20 minute wait for two people. Food was good (my biscuits were a bit stale) and portions are huge.

Would come back though"
37,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Warning! Huge portions.....  cool place, good food, and friendly service.... 
Recommend..."
38,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I loved it so much, I ate here twice in one visit to Vegas!!! I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken for breakfast.... (This was the one on Man Vs. Food) and it was amazing and a lot of food... If you are coming here, bring your appetite!!!"
39,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You never have to walk around hungry in vegas, and the latest addon to join in central strip is this 24-hour chain. Located inside Quad, soon to be Linq Hotel, you will see a escalator right in the middle of the Casino floor, which will bring you to the goodies upstairs. 

Menu will leave you with a lot of different options and new flavors. And if you never been, you should ask for some suggestions or maybe go with the marked favorites. Its a laidback atmosphere overall and you shouldnt have to bring your fanciest wig to stay safe (Although you can, since its vegas).

Whichever you decide to order, you will not be served an ordinary dish. It will be presented in a magnificent way, probably somehow include waffles even if its main, and HUGE! But dont be intimidated by the size of the portion, this is the place where you dont have to be afraid of asking for a doggy bag.

Prices are cheap, service is cool and the place is opened 24/7...
How could you complain?"
40,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the greatest COMFORT food spot ever! The way they created fusion dishes were so impressive. The only thing I can complain about is how long it takes to get the food. I immediately got over it as soon as I took my first bite of my dishes. My buddy and I ordered the Watermelon lemonade, which was delicious btw. The plates we got were the Andy's sage fried chicken and waffles. We also got the Sage Chicken Benedict. Both dishes were amazing. The meat was juicy, lightly breaded, great sauce on both dishes, and made to make your heart melt. I love you Hash House! 

Recommendation: Watermelon lemonade, Andy's sage fried chicken and waffles, and sage chicken benedict."
41,Hash House A Go Go,2,Disappointed this time. Went to Quad location. Our salads came out the same time as our food. The food quality seems like it's gone down since we last visited. I like the Sahara location better overall. This location didn't have the same feel.
42,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge huge portions so I would suggest to share rather than get your own plate. Although portions were a lot, taste of food was not worth it. Wasn't a fan. Very bland and rather tasting the chicken waffle, all I tasted was the sage they stick right in there. Food was nice to look at, but we didn't even finish or take our food to go. Honey biscuits were prolly the best thing I ate there."
43,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'm not a huge fan but my friends are so I have to go when i'm in Las Vegas.
-Insanely enormous portions(hope you're hungry).
-Sort of expensive in my opinion.
-Jam packed crowded  almost all of the time.
-Open 24 hours.
-Food is decent but not remarkable.
-Bloody Mary's are awesome but pricey.
-Depressing windowless environment with strange fluorescent lighting.
-Service is good.
Definitely worth stopping in & checking it out."
44,Hash House A Go Go,5,"There are not enough words in the English language to explain how very much I loved this place.  So incredible.  The food, besides being very homey, comforting and delicious, was PURE ARTWORK on a plate.  Would go back in a NY second.  Wish we had a location out here in the Tampa Bay area.  Oh and the Bloody Marys are to die for and I am not usually a big Bloody Mary fan!"
45,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Had a horrible experience! Was seated in a area that staff knew the waitress Terry was on a break. We were ignored by wait staff and when asked for the manger Kevin to ask why we haven't been helped, he was so rude about it we left. I returned to ask for his supervisors name and to voice my disappointment on how he handled the situation as a manager, he gestured to get out and he would call security. Minutes later he was in the Linq lobby arguing loudly with another customer and staff member. He Later accused us of stealing a broom and dust pan. Staff were shocked and told me that his comments on us being a thief was so racist. Complaints are filed and authority called. Manager is the worst!!"
46,Hash House A Go Go,1,"worst service ever, waited forever to get a waiter, and hate the owner's atittude, we had to leave because of this bad experience!"
47,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portions= HUGE 

Brown sugar banana pancakes= BOMB

Prices= REASONABLE 

location= right inside the LINQ!

Wait time? = SHORT. 

Party for 7, said it'd be a 35 minute wait. 5 minutes later and they called us in!
Our server was awesome."
48,Hash House A Go Go,5,Honestly the food is amazing and the proportions are amazing! The speed for how busy they were was on point and the steak was amazing the eggs were done right and the mashed potatoes was to die for! Highly recommend the steak and eggs !!!
49,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is cool. They have nice specialty drinks. I had one of their bloody Mary's. Pretty good. It featured a pickled green bean, jalapeÃ±o stuffed olive and lemon. The base was spicy but not over the top. I enjoyed it. For breakfast, I had a hash made with chicken, asparagus, garlic and other veggies. It was pretty good but, in my personal opinion, it wasn't really a hash. The ingredient combinations was slightly off. One friend got the French toast and he enjoyed it. Two of my friends had the Andys Benedict. By far, the Andys Benedict was the star. All food portions were HUGE but the Benedict was crazy large and packed with flavor on every bite. Honestly, it very easily shared. Two people could eat the Benedict and be full. Wait staff was mediocre but overall it was not a bad experience."
50,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place is a bit of a novelty. The portions are ridiculously big and the menu is pretty unique. It's definitely worth checking out to say you ate a 3lb meatloaf garnished with a pine tree in it.
51,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food was good, not great but the service was so bad and slow.  Took 45 minutes and they forgot one of our meals.   Portions are so large it is gross."
52,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Giant portions, fun loud atmosphere, great service, and good food.  It was very busy when we went, so we had to wait about 15 minutes for our table.  Try the Chicken and Waffles!"
53,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Located on the Las Vegas Strip, to the Linq Hash House A Go Ho is a very infamous breakfast hotspot in Las Vegas. Being a chicken and waffle fan, I absolutely had to see what the rave was about on their chicken and waffle dish. Their menu didn't really offer a wide variety, however they did have chicken and waffles and burgers. I ordered both. The food comes in very large portions; so unless you have a huge appetite, I'd probably recommend sharing since the meals go about $20 bucks a plate. Needless to say, the chicken and waffle kind of disappointed. It was very well presented, however coming from Texas we have way better chicken. This chicken tasted really bland and kind of tasteless. A thing that I thought was cool however, was that they battered their waffle mix with bacon and cook it into the waffle.
The burger was more enjoyable than the chicken and waffle. 
Overall, pretty decent meal on the strip and great that it's open 24/7. I believe we came here around 3 an after gambling at Planet Hollywood. This is a good restaurant that's close by and that's opened and is not a good stand. However you're probably better off saving money and your stomach at a food stall open around. I hope if I come back to five it another chance that Hash House A Go Go will not disappoint."
54,Hash House A Go Go,4,My husband and I found this place which serves a good breakfast with large potions instead of over eating at a Buffett!   The price was pretty reasonable too!
55,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place has a long ass line for a reason! It's been about 2 years since I've been here (unfortunately didn't go on my trip a few months ago) but I've yet to forget about how tasty the breakfast food was that I ate.

I can't even really remember my exact dish but I do recall it having some huge, delicious pancakes. I also remember thinking about how the long wait was all worth it when my food came out.

The fact that I'm writing a review about my experience two years later should tell you something about how great it is. I probably won't be back until 2019 :(...... call ahead, get there early, whatever it takes for you to try this place!"
56,Hash House A Go Go,5,We can't come to Vegas and not eat breakfast at Hash House. Beware the portions are HUGE! Ask for some homemade jam for your biscuit; on the day I was there this week they served peach jam. It was out of this world.
57,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of my favorite meals during my trip in Vegas. Luckily we didn't have to wait long as we came on a weekday during lunch. We waited probably around 10 minutes. Be warned, the portions are as big as your head. As 5 small Asian girls we knew this before coming in and yet we still couldn't help ourselves and ordered a dish each. My favorites were the Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict and the brown sugar banana pancake. The chicken, the chipotle sauce and the mash potatoes all went so well together. The pancake was the best pancake I ever had. It was just so fluffy and thick with plenty of bananas mushed in it. My friend didn't like her country fried chicken steak but other than that everything else including the fried chicken and waffle dish was delicious. And of course we didn't finish our food. Can't wait to come back here again!"
58,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The sage-fried chicken bacon waffle bomb with fried leeks is one of the best things I've eaten on Earth. It's the most decadent, delicious, over-the-top, quintessentially Vegas thing you could imagine. No hangover would stand a chance against it. It took me almost a full day to recover from it. And I may have gone temporarily diabetic from it. All good. First place I'd go to next time I hit Vegas. It's when you find the bacon in the waffle after a couple bites of the perfect fried chicken that you realize you're high on food and that there might be a God. And he likes eating.

Only drawback is it's kinda hidden, in the second floor of a casino and has no windows or a view, feels a little too boxed in. Still not enough to even diminish the score."
59,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Was packed on a Sunday afternoon.  Glad we came though.  Had Andy's chicken and waffle.  Bacon was infused in the waffles, so you can't go wrong.  The chicken had a sage flavor to it, and was nicely breaded.  The breading actually stayed on the chicken as you cut it, instead of falling apart.  Our waiter Jason was pretty cool.  It was busy, and you can tell he was in a rush, but took the time to split our checks.  Definitely a good stop for a foodie.  Portions are huge like everyone says.  I think 2 plates could have fed us 5 guys.  Try it out."
60,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food here is fantastic!  The portion sizes are huge (chicken and waffles could have fed two people!)   Our server took forever to greet our table, but once she got settled all was good.  One of my fave breakfast spots in Vegas!"
61,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Was so looking for a great bacon breakfast......  I love bacon, heard this place was a great place to go for it.  First off, waited almost 50 minutes to get a table, then told it would be 35 minutes to get our food because it's all prepared fresh.  45 minutes later my food came, no bacon and no food for my bf.  Told waiter no bacon,  when he does bring it, it's cold and greasy like it had been sitting in a precooked pile for some time.  Asked him to crisp it up, brings back the same bacon still cold, greasy and not crisp.  Third trip, no change we told him to forget it as I had already finished the rest of my food.  Like I said, came for a bacon breakfast, we emphasized this, how we wanted it cooked etc., did not seem to matter.  I will say the other food;  eggs, potatoes, and pancake were decent and would have been fine if the bacon was good and the service and time factor (total of 3 hours for a breakfast) were significantly better.  Overall, a very bad experience for my fist time in Vegas.  Would not go back.  Btw, they did charge us for the bacon."
62,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came for breakfast and got our food at lunch time. It was a Monday morning and the wait for 2 was about 45 minutes. We ordered right away (since we had plenty of time to mule over the menu) and waited for another 45 minutes for our food to come out. 
When you wait that long for your food you would expect the food to be hot...nope! Food was heat lamp warm and it was okay. Very disappointing since everyone raved about this place. 
I had the French toast combo and my partner in crime had the Andy's sage fried chicken. You do get a lot of food for your money but it's just not worth the wait. While waiting we saw so many people go up the elevator, turned around and went back down because they saw the line. 
I'm glad I checked it out because now I can say I did and am not coming back."
63,Hash House A Go Go,2,Giving two stars because it took a LONG time to get seated with the restaurant not busy at all. And get seated with no menus. Food is fresh and big portions but you pay the price.
64,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict was amazing. Way too much food but so worth it. The service was mediocre; they weren't too friendly and it felt like our host and waiter were rushing us the entire time, but the food made up for it."
65,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place rocks!!! Talk about a hearty meal with all the flavors!! Usually when you find a restaurant that serves large portions, the taste is compromised... but not Hash House A Go Go!!! 

We ordered the Sage Benedict which is featured on Man vs Food! It was incredible. We of course had to split it because the portion was large enough to feed an army! The only thing I cant's stand is when restaurants charge a split plate fee. I don't understand why they do this. They aren't wasting anymore food on you or are you costing them anymore money. It doesn't make sense and Hash House A Go Go charges you for splitting. Annoying!

But overall the mean was AMAZING!!!!!"
66,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food here was great! Large portions and very delicious. But the service and ambiance is terrible. The restaurant is cramped and dark and dingy, not the kind of place I would want to eat breakfast at. The waiter asked my husband if he would like some gravy on the side for his meal, his tone and manner implied that this extra would be complimentary, we latter saw on the bill that it was not. $4.50 for the smallest side of gravy ever. My biscuits and gravy was supposed to come with two biscuits but is was just one cut in half, not cool hash house. And the cherry on top was when it came time to pay the bill the card reader was broken. They asked us to pay in cash and we had none so they tried to make us use the ATM downstairs which was not free obviously. After much waiting we finally got them to take our payment by card the old fashioned way with carbon paper. They didn't offer us any discount or coupon for our trouble and were very inattentive during the whole process! So all in all it was great food but they aren't straight forward or clear about the costs and what comes with your meal and don't seem to care much for customer satisfaction."
67,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was in search of a neutral location for a family ""reunion"" of sorts and our original idea was a brunch type venue. I've heard various things about Hash House A Go Go but more or less the reviews were great. 

I have nothing spectacular to report about the service but I'm appreciative to the wait staff that allowed my crazy Italian family and I plenty of time to catch up (thanks!). 

The food. WOW! Talk about HUGE portions! I ordered the chicken salad ""sandwich"" with mac and cheese as my side. I must say, the mac and cheese was some of the best fatty food I've had in a while! The chicken salad was dwarfed by the extremely large pieces of Texas toast it was jammed in between. 

All in all, my family enjoyed their selections and I thoroughly enjoyed the mac and cheese portion of my meal. 

I would definitely visit this fine establishment again, I probably wouldn't order the chicken salad sandwich though...just sayin ;)"
68,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So, this review just popped up on my FB news feed from last year's Vegas vacation. 

We spent a week there and the Hash house was our best meal. We Love to eat and drink we love Vegas. We took the advice of a few friends of sheer to dine. Needless to say, we won't do that again, instead, we'll follow the yelpers!

I remember the wait was ridiculous and rightfully so, the food was amazing and the mocha was to die for. Our server just kept them coming. When I go to Vegas, I don't really like to eat at the typical fancy places, I like to go where I know I'm getting the best food and service. The go go did not disappoint. Looking forward to seeing you guys again this year."
69,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had dinner here with friends. Drinks were great- I had the spiked watermelon lemonade cocktail. Portions were huge and shareable. We ordered the chicken and waffles, chicken pot pie, and fried green tomatoes stack- nest bang for your buck!"
70,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I initially was very excited to check out a restaurant on man vs food. Overall had a great experience with the waitress's customer service and food quality but just had two minor mishaps. First off the front hostess was busy talking to her friend that she ignored us for the first 3 minutes even though there was no line. After being seated initially we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who was very knowledgeable of the menu and made recommendations. I ordered the fried chicken Benedict (featured on man v food) and my friends ordered burgers. First off the portions are very large, I'm a Farely robust male myself but finished 25 percent of my meal. The negative aspect was my friends had wax paper in his burger which I didn't expect from such a renown restaurant. Luckily the chef made the burger again himself and brought it out to us apologizing and comped my friends burger. I was very impressed with his way of approaching the situation and the rest of the meal was pleasing. Will return but had to deduct a star for such an elementary mistake. Prices are fair ranging from 12-25 dollars and very family friendly and will return."
71,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always a reliably good LARGE meal from this lesser known chain of restaurants.  Seriously the portions are enormous, share your meal and tip well.  Even the child portions are more than most adults would eat.

The wait to get seated was about 20 minutes even though it was 7am in LV.  Once we were seated, the food came very quickly. My brother went at 1am the same morning and waited close to 45 minutes, so basically it seems they are always busy.

There is much more ""elbow room"" in this location compared to their San Diego location, which I really appreciated."
72,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Sooo Good!
Chicken & Waffles, Bacon Pancakes I had the bacon waffles and corned beef h"
73,Hash House A Go Go,5,Omg I needed a stretcher to get me out of there! Food was amazing! You def can NOT finish your plate in 1 seating! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves good food!
74,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So much food! I got a stuffed burger with bacon and mashed potatoes. It was so good. I don't think you can make any bad choice's, huge portions and delicious food. Friendly staff, open 24/7."
75,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place is A M A Z I N G!!!!!  There take on food is genius!!!  The Sage Chicken and Waffles is a MUST!!!!
76,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Whenever we are in Vegas we have to come here ... usually a wait but it moves.
The food is heavy comfort food I love the chicken fried steak. And the mashed potatoes are amazing. 
Also the cocktails have great flavor to them.
The wait staff is friendly and for being so busy really attentive.
Great place all around"
77,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My friend and I stayed at the Linq hotel and finding Hash House here was a delightful surprise. I am from San Diego and Hash House is really popular there. Its reputation in San Diego definitely carried over to its Vegas location. On a Sunday during prime lunch hours, we tried to go in and left when we saw the crowd waiting in the lobby. We returned Monday morning instead.

We ordered the vanilla waffles and the sausage gravy pot pie. The vanilla waffles were excellent with the perfect crunch in every bite. I coated my waffle with butter and syrup to enjoy the smooth silky sweet taste. The sausage gravy pot pie was so large we were confident it could feed at least four people. We also found the pie sat on a huge amount of mashed potatoes. If you are going to get the pot pie and some pancakes  or waffles, you may consider choosing a different side from mashed potatoes. The pot pie comes with the same mashed potatoes and it was more than enough for us two. I found the pot pie to be a bit dry with the mashed potatoes.

My only disappointment is with the availability of sweet choices on the menu. There was a limited selection of choices. I'm guessing their core focus is for savory breakfast choices."
78,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'd been dying to try the San Diego location since friends keep posting pictures of these giant fancy plates of food from this place. We walked in about 9 am on a Sunday morning. We saw lots of people sitting in the waiting area so we were expecting a wait but luckily the hostess just ushered us in. They have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. Guess there were large groups outside. But by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. Anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. I already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. The guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. Hahaha. So I split the house hash with chicken. It was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. We were starving but it was so much food. The two of us had trouble finishing it. It wasn't that amazing either. The food is just ok. I don't know if I love it or will crave it in the future. It's a little bit greasy. I think their gimmick is just huge portions and I guess their food presentation is pretty good. My friend got the Andy's sage fried chicken eggs benedict (which is a Man vs Food fav) but man it's like almost a foot high, everything piled on top of each other. Looked really good. I only tried a bit of the mashed potatoes and chicken and hollandaise sauce. It was tasty. That dish was like $16 though. Everything is about $15 or more but I guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok. Hard to have leftovers on vacation though and I'm guessing a lot of people that come here are tourists. Oh and the other guy at our table got the combo with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and fruit. The waffle took up like  of the plate and half of the waffle went home with us as well. Haha. Oh and I have to mention service was horrible. Our waitress liked to disappear for long periods of time. She was nice and polite but nowhere to be found. Other people brought out our drinks and food. And we had to flag other wait staff to get an extra plate and boxes at the end. Man, it would've been a much quicker meal if we had better service."
79,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best Breakfast in Vegas excluding Ceasers brunch buffet off course. 

Really great food, great food presentations and if you get an alcoholic drink they give you the Glass to keep! But the wait time here sucks, so go put your name down, then play some slots to kill the time."
80,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First understand this place serves giant plates of food!  Now that is out of the way also understand that the menu leans starch heavy.

Both the chorizo and meatloaf hash were amazing. They had bursts of fresh vegetables and fruits but the stars are the hashes. The fresh made strawberry jelly was outstanding. We also experience the sage fried chicken benedict.  This mountain had a base of potatoes with a split biscuit on top, followed by tomatoes, spinach, bacon, mozzarella, the kitchen sink,... Finally ending with the most amazing sage fried chicken and chipotle cream gravy.  Two of us couldn't finish it!"
81,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came at 8pm on a Sunday and there was no line.   Lot of items on the menu.   Portion is HUGE.  If you don't have a big appetite, you may want to share with someone.   My boyfriend and I couldn't finish one order of chicken and waffle.   Food is ok only.  Not something I would come back for.   I see people wait in line for 45 + minutes; I don't think it's worth it.   The biscuit is delicious though"
82,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Will never, ever go here again.  Even though they did fix the issue and they apologized profusely, it is still unacceptable what happened to us.

We arrived at our hellhole hotel (The Quad) at 9am and we couldn't check in until 12pm.  To waste time, we checked out the car show and then decided to have brunch.  Since HHAGG is in the Quad and had such great reviews, we decided to give it a shot.  It was packed when we got there but we ended up scoring a seat at the bar.

When the bartender took our drink orders, hubs got a water and I asked for a chocolate milk - when it was served, it wasn't even the real chocolate milk...it was white milk with hershey's syrup pooled at the bottom!  It hadn't even been stirred!  Whatever...I choked it down while I perused the menu.  We ended up making our choices and I ordered the eggs/bacon/potato/biscut breakfast and hubs got the special burger they had that day.  

The waitress got our order and then about 5 minutes later she got the orders of the people on other sides of us.  Well, we waited, and waited, and waited....we wanted to order mimosas to celebrate our trip but the bartender was MIA....we finally got so annoyed when she finally did show up that we just stuck with waters.  Finally they brought out food....to our neighbors!!  Bartender assured us twice that our food was ""coming right up"" but it seriously took over an hour from the time we placed our order to the time we got our food.  Reminder: I got freaking EGGS and he got a burger.  Unless they had to murder the cow and grind the meat right there, an hour is unacceptable.

Whatever, I was irritated but hungry so I tucked into my eggs.  Eggs=meh - I ordered scrambled and they were partially runny and partially burned....neither of which I like.  Bacon was good, potatoes were great and the biscut and homemade jam were the jam!  I look over at hubs and he's looking a little green....he bit into his burger and it. was. raw.

Like...still able to see the white bits of fat in the beef raw.  So after a few minutes of searching, we were able to flag down the bartender and she apologized profusely and said another one would be ""right up.""  It was obvious that this was a biiiig mistake because we had at least 3 people checking on us (managers and cooks) and apologizing profusely, and they even brought us out a free cornbread (phenomenal) for the whole issue.  However, it took another 20 minutes to get another burger - by that time I was done with my breakfast (1/2 of which he ate) and he wasn't feeling another burger anyways, so he took one bite and boxed it up.  He ended up throwing it out once we got to our room.  They did comp his meal but I would have been furious if they hadn't.  They did handle the issue as best as they could, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place.  Maybe, MAYBE would I understand if the food came out freaky fast, but if they couldn't get it right in over an hour, I don't know how they get anything right."
83,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Simply one of the most amazing breakfast I've ever had. The meatloaf hash over eggs with biscuit melts in your mouth. Wife got the fried chicken Benedict and it was 5 stars as well. Great friendly service, affordable for Vegas standards especially considering the food quality. Always a wait but line moves fast and it's certainly worth the wait."
84,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is awesome!!! Great food and drinks. Portions are massive and totally shareable . Try the sage fried chicken and wAffles ! Bloody Mary's are a popular drink here but I really enjoyed the strawberry lemonade margarita and the watermelon kiwi drink. You will have a wAit but it is a must for brunch or breakfast!
85,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Can I make two some suggestions?  

1).  Offer a half portion of the signature dishes. There was so much I wanted to try but one adult and three kids couldn't even finish one sage fried chicken and waffles entree. Yes, I think your portion sizes are too ginormous (is that even possible?!), especially since hotels don't have fridges and microwaves to reheat leftovers. There was so much food going to waste because the average Joe doesn't eat that much. 

2).  Get in line online. This location is so popular with a one hour wait time. There should be an app or something so I can put my name on the waitlist without going to the restaurant and receive a text when my table is ready. 

Otherwise, food and service lived up to the hype."
86,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was so surprised to find such great food inside the casino. Order one meal for two people, as portions are huge! Which was a little disappointing because I could've tried more dishes. We shared the crab cakes, yum. I am also impressed with the chef's presentation. Danielle was absolutely delightful! Really, she loves her job, and we can tell."
87,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is AWESOME!  Went to Las Vegas to visit my mother for her 81st birthday!  Went to Hash House after seeing a review on Yelp!   Thank You Yelp!  We went, the food was simply scrumptious and was worth waiting in line for.  The wait staff were so friendly and nice and the atmosphere was pleasant.  We had the Eggs Benedict, which I've NEVER loved until I tried this place.  One Pancake could feed an Army and was SOOO Good.  I heard there is one in Texas; I'm gonna make it a point to find it and go again."
88,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This restaurant is a bit of a walk to get to. Once you get into the Linq you have to walk quite far through the casino until you can get into the restaurant. It was luckily not busy so we were able to get seated right away. It did take our waitress a while to get to us and I'm not really sure what she was doing but it was fine since it gave my mom and I a chance to look at the menu. We decided we weren't in the mood for the signature dishes, and also noticed that the sage chicken and waffles was up to $21 from other reviews where I had seen it for $17, so we opted for some sandwiches. My mom got the BBBLT sandwich which is basically a BLT with a lot of bacon with sweet potato fries which was a dollar extra. This added up to $14. I got the mushroom Swiss stuffed burger which is mushroom and Swiss between two patties on a burger, with fries which was also $14. They were huge, but I expected that since I had read reviews on this site before going. Having said that we skipped lunch so were hungry, and we both finished about 2/3 of our meals. They were good - but not the best food I've eaten in Vegas. Because of size for value, and not having to wait, I would give 4 stars."
89,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I decided to give the Hash House A Go Go at Imperial Palace a try since I had already visited the one on Sahara Ave.  Given the past reviews of how mediocre this location was, I took it with a grain of salt and set low expectations.  And in a way, it helped.

The restaurant is definitely much smaller than the Sahara location and it did feel a little congested.  It might have been because I sat at the bar instead of a table.  Also the vibe of the restaurant felt different maybe because it's on the Strip with more tourists whereas the Sahara location was more laid back.  The really good thing though is that their prices are pretty much the same so no inflated Strip prices here.

After tackling Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict last time, I decided to try their Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=9bcLmRftsqxJ9ISx6atDlg). Boy, did I totally underestimate how doughy those Bacon Waffles would be.  I was a little bummed out that I didn't get too much syrup, but I was too hungry that morning to wait much longer.  I didn't think I did too bad though, I managed to leave just two waffles behind =).  The Chicken sadly was overcooked this time so overall I had a really doughy and dry meal.  If I had to choose my favorite between the Chicken and Waffles or the Fried Chicken Benedict, the Fried Chicken Benedict wins hands down.  Much more flavor and not very dry thanks to the Chipotle Cream Sauce.

I probably won't be coming back to this location again unless I happen to be at Imperial Palace with a huge hunger attack.  I think I'll stick with the Sahara location from now on."
90,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Another visit to Hash House, although the crazy hype this place is overrated. I prefer a quality tasting breakfast over a behemoth serving. I felt gross after. Service was okay, waitress lagged, I do recommend this place for the quantity, but the price isn't justice."
91,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow!!! You Yelpers have yet to fail me. We got into Vegas early in the morning and decided once we checked in we'd go have breakfast and walk around and skip lunch as we were saving ourselves for our buffett dinner. Having not been to Vegas in 4 years I had no idea where the heck the Quad was. We kept walking and walking (we stayed at the Wynn Encore) my brother in law said ""You just want to go to Dennys?"" I said ""We did not come to Vegas to go to Dennys!"" We walked maybe two more minutes and there was the Quad. We checked in and only had to wait about 5min for a table. As we were being walked to the table we were all looking at everyones plate. Amazing! We saw a lot of Chicken and Waffles! I can't eat that much so I just ordred an egg and toast. My husband ordred the Chroizo and Jalapeno hash.. I ate off his plate too.. OMG, sooo tasty. He also ordered a Bloody Mary.. Holy Cow, the best Bloody Mary in Las Vegas by far! I ordered one to go! Our breakfast was amazing. Great place, wonderful and warm service.. You can bet we will be back! Can't wait!!"
92,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for brunch, and they did not fail. Big portions, that I would not even dream of trying to eat this myself. Travis, the waiter, was super friendly, and made our experience much better. Gave us great recommendations as well, try their pancakes! We ordered the Brown Sugar Banana pancake to share between 4, and it was a goner in minutes."
93,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We came at 6pm and there was no line, so they seated right away. The service was good and the food was huge and tasty! I would recommend sharing if you do come or go on an empty stomach. They also gave us a complimentary biscuit which was also huge and amazing! We had buffets the two days previous, and wanted to try something different. This place did not disappoint."
94,Hash House A Go Go,2,"meatloaf was dry as hell, the kokomo was not worth getting. portions are huge! i ate half the kokomo as was full for the rest of the day. HH bloody mary are the SH*T!!!! lines were long, food came out fast, service was great."
95,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I had a chance to eat here on my last trip to Vegas.  The place was packed on a weekday morning around 10 am, so I had  to wait for half an hour to get seated.   Service was fairly prompt, and the food came out in decent amount of time considering how packed the place was.

The food was decent, but nothing really overwhelmingly good.  I ordered the corned beef hash, with eggs and potatoes.  This place is supposed to be the 'hash house' so I was expecting this to be knocked out of the park.   The food was served very lukewarm.  It wasn't anywhere near being hot.  I was disappointed by this and informed the server.  She offered to bring more corned beef, which there was no way to refuse.  Soon after she brought a full side plate of corned beef which at least equaled the portion served in the meal.  Shortly after that a manager came by to apologize for the initial dissatisfaction with the food.

So at least they made a serious effort to address their cold food, but seriously when I pay 14  bucks for a breakfast entree it should be frigging perfect."
96,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Horrible service from the wait staff. The food was just as good as the original location but service SUCKS!!!!! I ordered the Chicken Benedict and they ran out of biscuits. Instead of telling me, they had the nerve to serve it without and try to sneak it past me. Our table of 6 received our food one plate at a time over the course of 20 minutes. What is even funnier, is that the last item served was a salad! I will only go to the original location from now on, this one blows."
97,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband and I went here for the first time this morning! The food was amazing!!! The gravy is a must! I ordered the chicken with mashed potatoes, eggs and a biscuit. My husband had the simple breakfast with eggs, sausage, potatoes and biscuits and gravy. We tried everything and it was all delicious!!! Our waitress was very nice and helpful in recommending dishes to us! We arrived around 9 on Saturday and were seated right away. (When we left at 10 there were more than 50 people waiting, now we know why) We will definitely go here again for breakfast!"
98,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Drinks...AMAZING!  Food....Amazing! The dining experience a Sure Bet in Vegas

Drinks...AMAZING!  Food....Amazing! Prices...Awesome!  The dining experience a Sure Bet in Vegas"
99,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Eaten at a various locations in CA and NV and the one thing I can say is that the quality and service is top notch! Food was excellent, service was just as good. I always look forward to my next visit to Hash House A Go Go..."
100,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Honestly, I am not a breakfast person. Never liked pancakes because every time I eat them I feel like I am chewing Styrofoamey nothingness that sucks so fucking bad that you must add Aunt Jemima and butter to it to make them somewhat edible.  

However, the dilemma is that my better half loves breakfast and so, we compromise and usually have brunch... with bottomless mimosas and/or Bloody Mary's  to wash that Styrofoam down. So, when we were in Vegas recently and she suggested that we eat at Hash House a Go Go (HHAGG) at The LINQ before leaving Las Vegas like Nick Cage, I was like, ""of course honey"" because you know, happy wife... yadda yadda yadda. 

When we showed up at high noon like clueless morons that get shot by stray gunfire at a shootout, we were totally ambushed by the 45-minute wait. We should have thought it through that a lot of people would be grabbing a bite to eat before heading back to their not-so-sinful cities... Damn that hangover...  speaking of Hangover, if you get to the end of my review, I have a treat for you...

Anyways, I gave the server my name and after receiving a plastic laminated number card, we headed out to kill some time by exploring the stores at The LINQ Promenade, which felt a lot like The Grove in Los Angeles sans a trolley and actual worthwhile stores to spend money at. This place looks much better at night, kind of like that girl/guy from Drai's or Hakkasan that you somehow end up waking up next to. 

By the time we got back to HHAGG, we waited another 5 minutes and then our number was called. Then they do this weird fucking thing where they make you stand on a red rug in the middle of the restaurant. All I can say is that, it was weird just standing there. 

After a few minutes we were seated and our awesome hipster-bearded server, Andrew, served us. We ended up sharing the most popular dish that was purported to be a New York Times favorite on the menu... the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. 

Let me repeat - we SHARED this shit. 

This thing was humongous. It came with two Jurassic-sized fried chicken breasts with waffles that had hardwood smoked bacon cooked into them that was then topped with a hot maple reduction, and fried leeks... all this stuff was stacked into a giant tower that was all skewered together with a rosemary spear and a freaking steak knife. 

Truly amazing... All for less than $20! We ended up getting the tractor iced coffee for around $3 and this was always refilled promptly by Andrew and he even gave us a to-go cup for our 4th helping of iced coffee when we were leaving. 

I've had chicken and waffles elsewhere. I've done the fancy at Bouchon and of course the not-so-fancy at Roscoe's. But honestly, I have never enjoyed chicken and waffles to the point that I literally sounded like I was having an orgasm as I ate and after I ate because I was moaning so much from the tasty food and from being so full. Oooooh! Ohhhhhhhhhh! Oh gawd! 

Everything was tasty. The batter of the sage fried chicken was perfect and adding bacon to the waffles made a world of a difference. And the leeks! Holy smokes were they fucking delicious!

Look, people that give HHAGG a bad review are ""hhaggs"" that ended up not getting the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Stick to what they are good at. That is like going to Lawry's Prime Rib and complaining that their spinning salad sucks. Of course it's going to fucking suck dipshit, that's why they spin it. 

Look, this place is open 24/7 so take a break from drinking, macking, gambling, bringing-your-homies-down-because-you-lost-all-your-wages-on-the-1st-night-like-a-chump-and-got-a-cash-advance-from-your-credt-card-with-28%-interest, and/or sucking-your-gut-in... and just go-go to Hash House a Go Go. It will be the best decision you make. Just anticipate a wait if you go during peak hours.

* So I referenced the Hangover earlier... the following is a true story. I went to the Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in South Los Angeles off Manchester and a brother came up to me and literally said, ""hey I saw your hairy ass penis in that movie! Too-da-loooooo...""  Damn that Ken Jeong. Damn you!"
101,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love it and they accommodated my dairy allergy!! Big portions of delicious food, and the service is usually spot on. Whenever someone comes to town and asks about breakfast, I suggest this place because it does not disappoint!"
102,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great breakfast. I ordered chicken and waffles. 4 bacon stuffed waffles and 2 chicken breast were piled high with a steak knife through the center to hold it upright. Average breakfast was around $15 and 1 dish could feed any 2 people. The impossible to finish dishes were not only delicious but beautifully decorated with fresh herbs making us feel like we were in a high end restaurant for a low price. Our waitress was slammed so our coffee cups were empty more often than full and I was ready to take syrup off of the neighboring table because it took so long to get some.
103,Hash House A Go Go,4,Be pre paired to wait up to 30 minutes no matter what time you decide to go here.  The food is worth the wait.
104,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place is pretty overhyped. The only reason it has any popularity is because the sizes are so ridiculously large. Sure, they may make you go ""wow!"" when your food comes out, but it's because of the mammoth portions, not because the food actually looks good.

Came here on a Sunday, 1.25 hour wait for four people. Which is fine, but there isn't much room for people to sit and wait. My friends got some variation on the eggs benedict--looked disgustingly huge and parts of it kept sliding off. My other friend got the pancakes, which were the size of two dinner plates combined. While they say their food is ""100 percent from scratch"" I felt that the food was average, and the flavors uninteresting.

Not a place for foodies."
105,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Pros:
Great service

Good food

Hidden location"
106,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Got the chicken and waffles and a ""Bud in a bag"", led to this restaurant by the Man vs. Food series.  Worth the wait, this place had amazing portions that most mortals could not finish.  The only negatives were a mildly friendly wait staff and walking through a smoky casino maze to get there, but if you come to Vegas, you must eat here!"
107,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hour an half hour wait to sit and get food. Was it worth it? Every delicious bite? So why so not five star? We did wait 1.5 hrs. But it is ridiculously delicious food. Beware, very large portions. You will be in food coma right after. We got the fried chicken Benedict. I personally hate fried chicken but it was on food network so had to try it. I would def recommend it. DELICIOUS!!!"
108,Hash House A Go Go,3,"01.22.12

These portions are NO JOKE.  You are guaranteed to drag your feet back to wherever you came from due to a massive food coma.

The three of us made the mistake of each ordering our own dish.  HUGE mistake, as each of us probably finished 30% of our meal.

My mouth watered as I read the description for the chicken pot pie [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=-6yQPWgE00jh-P1jbjDX0g].  It watered again as the waiter described the fried chicken benedict [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=9cTIvMmphM_aqx8ziBjc_A].  Good thing there are large portions of both to go around.

There is a reason Adam Richman did a challenge here.  I didn't fully realize how big of a beast he was until I saw our plates.  I bow down to Adam, and the food definitely won this round.

Do yourself a favor with a little pre-planning and grab a restaurant.com certificate to save yourself a couple of bucks (for drinks, you know)?

Total damage for three (after certificate): less than $40"
109,Hash House A Go Go,3,"So my BF and I were looking for a breakfast spot, a friend of ours recommend we try this place so we did, I personally wasn't impressed, I think its an ok place nothing special, they do have huge portions but thats it. My BF had the stuffed burger with fries thats was good, fries were nicely seasoned, I had the steak and eggs with a side of bacon, my steak had a good flavor but it had a lot of fat so it was kinda gross, the grilled mashed potatoes were also pretty good and the bacon was nice and crisp, other than that, I really don't have anything else to say, I did see a lot of people ordering the chicken and waffles so I might consider giving this place another chance."
110,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I went here specifically for the ridiculously huge serving of rosemary fried chicken and bacon waffles.  My recommendation is to plan on eating half or sharing with your party.  However, all the other dishes are massive as well so unless you come with a party that shares the same purpose, do not plan on sharing.  Once I finished laughing at the size of the the dish and decided to actually try and eat some I realized I needed a plan of attack.  So I moved the chicken to one side of my dish and the waffles to the other.  Then I proceeded to cut a piece of chicken, a piece of waffles and then put them together to consume.  I was certainly a fan and like the salty sweet combination of the fried chicken bacon and waffle with syrup.  Despite my effort I could not finish the dish and took the rest to eat on the way to Zion Canyon National Park (by the way, it should be consumed immediately as the chicken is not as crunchy and and the waffles too mushy after sitting in a to go box).  

I will try to come back when in Vegas, but it is about a 15 minute drive from the strip and certainly not walking distance.  So I will most likely visit on my way out of Vegas rather than during my stay when I enjoy to walk everywhere I go."
111,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is amazeballs!!! The portions are HUGE so go hungry. The pancakes are bigger than the plate and if you're not pork eater like my husband and I, the chicken sausage is to die for. Be prepared for a little bit of a wait but once seated the service is pretty quick. Pics definitely will be visiting the Chicago location real soon!"
112,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Late night dinner/snack at hash house a gogo at the linq hotel.  First timer to this location and as always the food is amazing in each and every way!  

To start off i decided to try the fresh squeezed tangerine juice.  Great choice! More on the tart side but i enjoyed every drop of it.  My meal of choice was the fresh corned beef hash.  Comes with potatoes and covered with melted cheese eggs and asparagus.  (No eggs in the picture)"
113,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Decent food (read: meh, there's better to be found).  I had the egg, bacon and avocado scramble which wasn't that big of a portion size unless you ordered it to get a ton of potatoes and a huge biscuit.

Friend ordered a flapjack - it's freaking huge and pretty tasty if that's your thing.

Hit or miss.  Probably better when it's late, your drunk, and there's not a lot of other options available."
114,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It is located inside The LINQ hotel towards the back that leads you to an escalator which will take you to the second level where the restaurant is.

Having visited their San Diego location before, I was already expecting the worse in terms of long wait time being it was a sunday brunch time. To my delight, only took about 15-20 mns for us to be seated. (party of 7)

Expect the plate servings to be big. Should have mention it to my brother because he was surprised to see how big they were. Ended up taking half of his plate to go.

Their biscuit always delivers. Soft and freshly baked. Honestly, just the combo of biscuit and scrambled egg can fill up any regular appetite. It did mine, so I ended up taking the chicken and mashed potato to go as well. (chicken sage plate) 

My sister in law commented on the food being alright and she's had better. Mine was ok. The mashed potato seem a little dry and the orange slice was on the sour side. The rest of my family seem to be satisfied with their orders. 

The service was ok. Our waitress always cheked on us if we needed anything, yet I had to ask twice for straws and 3 times for napkins. She just probably busy that it slip her mind. 

I say an ok place for breakfast. A little pricey but their food portion is worth it."
115,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is meant for SHARING! I had to get the man vs. food famous dish! MY GOD! Delicious and very enormous in size!!! I don't even think I made a dent in it! But this was a very cool experience! The restaurant has frames autographed photos of celebrities that have dined and stoped by! Snagged a pic of my fav! ( Channing Tatum, who doesn't love him ?! )"
116,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One word-amazing!  Everyone should try the Hash House experience!  The portions are huge because that is kind of their thing.  It can be a bit intimidating so you have been warned.  The food also comes out as it is made so you might get some plates before others, but at least you know it isn't just sitting back there.  I had the Eggs Benedict with a red pepper sauce and mashed potatoes.  It was incredible.  My husband had the reuben which I think is called a ""pub crawl"" on their menu.  It was awesome!  If you go for breakfast or brunch especially on a weekend, be prepared for a long wait.  But breakfast for dinner is always a good choice too!"
117,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here last summer and OMG!!!  Not only are the servings humungous, the food tastes great too."
118,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food and a great price for how much food you get. Ask for Haley! Great advise on what to eat! Take her word, she is right.  Amazing!"
119,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came in with my family and grandparents, and we were sat after a small wait. (Earlier the better, otherwise it'll be packed!)
The food comes in big hearty portions and you can get beer to go! You can even get a can of PBR in a brown bag! The Bloody Mary's looked killer, and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 
My grandparents shared the steak and eggs, my wife ordered a hash/scramble, and I got the chicken and waffles! Everyone was happy and had plenty to pass around to share as well! The chicken and waffles were awesome and had bacon within the center of the waffles!! My wife's hash was a solid choice too and was a ton of food! 
Plus, our server ""Billy F"" was on top of everything and really provided great, friendly, and super upbeat service!! THANKS! 

We loved it, and will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!!"
120,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You must visit here! We went for breakfast and split the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It's insanely huge but delicious, every ingredient was amazing. I dream of the chipotle cream sauce. That dish plus two coffees was $22 - can't find a better value breakfast in Vegas."
121,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came by for brunch on a Friday morning and the wait was 45 minutes. Keep in mind they don't seat unless the entire party is present.

Service was friendly, but the food did take another 45 minutes to arrive. I ordered the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, bacon with scrambled eggs. The fried chicken was very juicy and the batter was fresh! The scrambled eggs were good too. The mashed potatoes were slightly bland.

Will definitely have to return to try the other items on their menu. $20/person."
122,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy Portions! Famously known for the impressive size of every dish that's put out, it's totally worth the long wait you will likely experience to be seated. Just about every plate is big enough for two people to share. They are HUGE. However they are priced well so for the fun of it order your own to ooh and ahhh over each others plates!"
123,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG delicious AND great waiter with tons of banter!  Dealt with 5 dead tired co-workers after pulling an overnight remodel and having NO food in our bellies for 16 hours....  They fed us well, made great recommendations and delivered on the yumminess factor.  YES to their HASH - scrumptious."
124,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I tried this place out because of a good recommendation from my brother. 


The only thing that was great about this place was that it came in big portions... and... thats pretty much it. 

I had the sage fried chicken in penne pasta. The chicken was pretty much flavorless. I could not taste the sage flavor or even the chicken flavor in this fried chicken. The penne pasta was just a bland cream sauce that was nothing special. 

My dad had the corned beef hash and he said that his food was flavorless. We saw that everyone else was taking their food home because they thought it was good however, we thought... no need to take some flavorless food home. 

I would have to say that the only thing that brings this restaurant to 3 stars was their cucumber dressing on one of their salads with the polenta croutons and their honey coated biscuits. That was enough for a meal in my opinion. No need for the entree :)"
125,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This ia 3.5 rating review.
The wait was ridiculous...but luckily they have a bloody mary bar for $9. That helped but the alcohol soaked in quick as I was super hungry.
My friends and I ordered 3 dishes.
1. The popular fried chicken and waffles - this was very big and I liked the waffles, but  other than that I did not really find it to be awesome. The sage in the chicken is interesting and I guess that makes it special. The chicken was soft and not dry.
2. Fried chicken benedict - this one was okay. Lots of cheese and I'm sad the egg was not poached, it was scrambled. Definitely did not stand out to me though.
3. The salmon scramble with pesto, brie, and some other items. This one was good, I liked the scramble, though I was so full from trying all the other dishes I could barely finish this. The biscuit is very good too, like an oversized KFC biscuit. The potatoes it came with were okay.

Overall, this place was good for a one time thing, I wouldn't really go back just b/c the wait is long, and the space is annoying b/c people are walking EVERYWHERE. 
The food wasn't awesome, but if you like big portions for a decent price this is the spot for you!"
126,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yeah it has that old Vegas casino vibe to it. This place is dim lit and the food come in generous obnoxious portions. It's. Great place to get a ton of carbs in without any consideration of nutritional value
127,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love the food. Huge portions to take back to the room for later. Visiting is a must every time I'm in vegas.
128,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge portions, and open 24/7.  The food was just okay, nothing unforgettable. There was no waiting at 230am!"
129,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ohhhhhh man. Where to begin. SOOOOO GOOD. I should have gotten that mount of chicken mothered in whatever heavenly sauce it was smothered in, but I wasn't that hungry when we went there. I regret it now! Can't wait to return one day. Totally worth it not to eat at a buffet and eat here!!"
130,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place is great and has food of massive proportions! Get the fried chicken eggs benedict you'll want that it's humongous.
131,Hash House A Go Go,5,this place was great!     portion size is crazy - everything we ate was amazing -server was super nice - everything  was beautifully plated- I would definitely go back!
132,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was amazing!
Portions were ridiculously huge and our waitress was probably the nicest person I've ever encountered! 
It was pretty pricy but the portions are so large you can definitely split a plate."
133,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Amazing food but extremely long wait. If you are in Vegas for a short stay, pass on this retaurant. It is a half day affair!"
134,Hash House A Go Go,2,"It was ok. The wait was a bit ridiculous (40 minutes) but I guess that's Vegas brunch for you, so I can't complain much about that. The portions were large which I assume is the appeal. The chicken pot pie for example was enough to feed 2-5 people. It's quite over the top, and unfortunately not delicious for the amount you're getting, so a lot get wasted. The food in general is nothing exceptional. The taste was ok. The price was ok. Waitress did an exceptional job of upselling...to the point where a couple members of the party were sad to see that the side of gravy she asked if they wanted 1. had an extra cost and 2. had a crazy high extra cost...I think $5

Even though I thought this place was a bit over priced and over rated, I did not have a horrible experience. The service is organized and the atmosphere pretty cool. However, two other people at my table got food poisoning (we think from the smashed potatoes). That is the reason for the subpar review. I believe that the SD location has better food."
135,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The worst part of this restaurant is that it's located inside Imperial Palace...which imho is a complete dump.

The food quality is actually quite good and the price + portion size is excellent also.

They serve a lot of breakfast type dishes and is an excellent place to eat at after consuming copious amounts of alcohol."
136,Hash House A Go Go,5,after a friend told me about this place i decided to give her a try! The line was long but they got folks in and out pretty quick without you feeling rushed.I ordered the bananna pancake which was the best wagon wheel cake ive ever eaten!it was bigger than the plate and i couldnt finish it at all!
137,Hash House A Go Go,2,The food was okay. Didn't really like the potatoes. We also ordered the sage chicken Benedict. Could feed 3 people.
138,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great breakfast- bring your appetite! The large pancakes are big enough to share... tried the Brown Sugar Banana pancake and it didn't disappoint. The pancake had real banana slices inside the batter - so good.
139,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food is OK and reasonable quantity. However hashbrown instead breakfast potatoes that taste nasty.. When standing and waiting no one asked if I had been helped while servers and staff kept walking by me.  Stood there for like 30 mins.. Even after I had given my order.. Horrible staff, horrible customer service and they took long too.  This evaluation is nothing personal just giving my honest observation. If u go hope ur experience is better. I will not return there. For sure.."
140,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've had two very different experiences here in the last year. Both times service was really meh, took awhile to get orders down and water around. 

Post clubbing - late night the only hash plate they were serving was the corned beef one. The potatoes were a little dry and the egg seemed overcooked too. Was not impressed, but it was still a warm meal that hit my stomach real well with the drunchies I had. Would have given that experience a solid 2 because I'd never drag myself to go back there again with so many other great options on/near the strip.

Late brunch - finally got the chance to take a stab at the whole menu and everything everyone ordered this time around was so much better! Definitely still feeling this place as more bang for your buck than my first choice brunch location, but the potatoes were great and everything was cooked way better than my last visit.  We ordered a few - HH meatloaf hash, chicken pot pie, and chorizo. Meatloaf hash definitely wouldn't order again as the meatloaf was very bland but the chorizo one was very nomzable. It's changed my mind about hash house and I would come back, but I'm a little iffy about the dramatic inconsistency. 

I guess the moral of the story is to not come here to satisfy late night cravings."
141,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We've always thought about trying this place, but it was always prohibitively crowded, especially during lunchtime. Therefore, on our most recent trip to Las Vegas, we decided to stop by for some late night eats. Perhaps, it was partly due to the anticipation of trying the sage fried chicken after several unsuccessful attempts, but we were a bit disappointed. We tried the sage fried chicken with bacon waffle tower and crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin Benedict. We ended up preferring the pork tenderloin, but honestly, even on this dish, the griddled mashed potatoes was the best thing on there.

As for the sage fried chicken with bacon waffle, the presentation looked nice, but the taste just wasn't there. The fried chicken crust was lacking in flavor and just tasted too much like uncooked flour. The chicken was also dry which made things worse. The bacon inside the waffle was more of a novelty. The idea is interesting, but I feel that bacon flavored maple syrup would have done the same trick. The waffle portion wasn't bad, and this was the best part of the dish.

The crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin is essentially wiener schnitzel (battered and fried pork cutlet). The gravy that was served was very tasty and had a surprising hint of sweetness that made the gravy irresistible. Because they didn't provide much gravy, we asked for more gravy, which they charged us additional. We ordered the Farm Benedict version of the crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin which came with tomatoes, spinach and scrambled eggs instead of the typical poached egg that you get with a Benedict. The whole contraption sat upon a huge bed of griddled mashed potatoes which was the best thing of the meal. Unlike the typical smooth mashed potatoes, these griddled mashed potatoes were more like smashed breakfast potatoes where there was still substance to the potatoes, with some browning picked up by the griddling process. The potatoes were seasoned very well and the griddling really helped to make this the best part of the meal. Combining the gravy with the potatoes made them even better. 

All in all, you will get huge portions of food here. While the presentation might look fancier than your typical diner, the quality of the food is about the same as a typical diner. Most disappointing is the sage fried chicken which is definitely not the best fried chicken you've ever had, being both dry and saddled with a lackluster crust."
142,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yum!  Perfect after midnight food!  We stopped in after a late flight and loved it.  Our table ordered a few different menu options and were pleased with all.  Serving sizes are huge, so consider sharing....or taking a doggybag.  Will definitely be on our list next time we are in Vegas."
143,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I wanted to really like this place. I sat at the bar and found service to be slow and bartenders to be uninterested. The bar stools were extremely uncomfortable and bar ambiance was poor.

Ordered chicken hash. Portions were enormous. The biscuit was good but rest of meal lacked flavor l. Seems like an easy dish to make at home. I'd go again but try something different than hash... this is what they are known for, right?"
144,Hash House A Go Go,5,We arrived for breakfast there was a line around the corner. We were seated fast and our waitress was excellent.  The blueberry pancakes were the size of a steering wheel and the chicken was very tasty. The portions are so big two to 3 people can share a meal with leftovers. The bill was a bit pricey but worth the price. I would definitely come back and bring others....
145,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Let's just say this place is pretty amazing! It's worth the 45 min wait! The portions are huge you can split one meal between two people. I had a Farmers Scramble. Pretty good, wasn't a fan of them putting garnish in a perfectly good biscuit kind of ruined it for me. Makes your biscuit taste awful. Our server could have been a little better about refills and checking in on our table!"
146,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love everything about this place.  Every time I'm in Vegas, I make sure to have breakfast here. Yes,  it's typically at least a 30-minute wait,  but the huge portions and delicious food is totally worth it.  A favorite is the fried chicken and waffles, but the benedicts  and hashes are also amazing.  You get what you pay for here, and that's what keeps me coming back every year."
147,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food was amazing! I had the salmon, Brie and pesto scramble. My sister had the avocado, bacon scramble. Big portions could be split. I want to go back for the Bloody Mary!!  Service was excellent."
148,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We had just flown in from Houston and put our luggage in the hotel and decided we really needed some food. It was about 10 PM, so naturally I wanted breakfast. I love good corned beef hash, so this place, which was a block away seemed perfect. ""Farm fresh with a twist."" So I had the Pacers Hash, which was okay...a little bland. But it came out really fast, but was cold. Not cold, cold...but lukewarm...edible, but not right. Michelle had the giant Griddle Cheese Sandwich. Looked delicious with tomatoes and avocados. But the waiter, who had run through a few sides offered with that when we ordered, brought her fries instead of a salad. It was late and we were tired, so Michelle didn't point this out and just ate her sandwich. The waiter was a nice guy, very friendly. But he only had two tables and seemed much more concerned with being behind the bar, even though there were no bar customers, than he was with waiting his two tables. He wasn't slow or neglectful, just not as on top of things as maybe he should have been. Overall, a so-so experience."
149,Hash House A Go Go,4,"my boyfriend wanted to take me here so bad because it's one of his favorite spots to get breakfast in vegas! we waited about 45 minutes which was no problem for me at all, we don't mind waiting for food that's amazing! ordered their famous fried chicken & waffles and decided to split it once we saw how huge the portions were! it was yummy but has a unique flavor to it! i'm giving this place 4 stars because i'm not sure if i would go back again!"
150,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was really looking forward to Hash House. Everything was good, but sadly nothing was great. Our server was friendly but with an agenda. There were two items he recommended - chicken and waffles, and the fried chicken benedict. I wanted the former, so that was fine. But David, rebel that he is, wanted instead a combo of fried chicken, eggs, bacon mashed potatoes and biscuit. Our server tried hard to steer David back to the benedict - ""you have to trust me on this"". But it wasn't what he wanted, and he stood firm. Substituting sausage for bacon was not allowed. Maybe that's what happens when you wander off the recommended path. My chicken was very generous, and I loved the fried leeks on top. One piece of chicken was very good, the other had some soft and chewy bits and just didn't taste as good. The waffles were ok, but nothing special. David liked his chicken, but thought the potatoes were uninteresting and the biscuit heavy. On the way out we reminisced about an amazing breakfast we had on our last trip which was to Seattle at Lola. This wasn't that. It's an interesting breakfast place but not a great breakfast place."
151,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Thanks to my Yelp friends on Talk who recommended this to us.  I was seeing my cousin and his wife for the first time in over 15 years.  Wanted something fun, kid friendly since I had my 6 year old daughter and Talk brought me here.  

Our waiter Steve (aka Stevie which my daughter called him ) was so much fun. He was training a new waitress and she was very nice.  We loved the atmosphere and were very comfortable in the booth.

The children's menu had lots of choices and what does my daughter choose - Corn Flakes which arrived in a big white bowl with a huge strawberry almost the size of a plum - you should have seen my daughter's eyes open up.

I split the 1 pounder stuffed hamburger with bacon and avocado.  We were not charged a fee for us to share.  My husband ate the same thing but all to himself.

My cousin ordered the bacon stuffed waffles with chicken - it was huge and we just couldn't stop laughing about it.  Everything was delicious.  

Also, if you are bloody mary fans there were many variations to chose from.  My cousin really enjoyed his.

The only complaint was that they didn't have restrooms in the restaurant which you have to take the escalator down to the casino to use the bathroom.  

I would come again and I would bring guests too - Just loved it!"
152,Hash House A Go Go,4,Me and the hubby ordered the meatloaf sandwich.... We should have ordered just one and split it it was sooooooo huge.... but so delicious and we had leftovers.
153,Hash House A Go Go,3,"While chilling in our room (while watching food network) I saw a Man vs. Food episode featuring this restaurant. We dined here for dinner on July 2, with intentions of just having an appetizer. Two bad choices I wish I could go back and change: i) planning to eat dinner here instead of breakfast; and ii) intentions of having an appetizer.  Not many appetizers seemed appealing to us, and not much of the breakfast fare appeared on the dinner menu, so my husband and I split the Fried Chicken Benedict. I also had a watermelon lemonade (YUMMY!) and we were served some homemade biscuits with honey butter glaze (YUMMY YUMMY!). From the looks of other entrees landing on the tables around us, I decided to forego 3/4 of my biscuit to ""save room"" for dinner. The dish could have feed another two people! It was very delicious - all of the ingredients were very fresh (crispy and juicy fried chicken breast served on top of split biscuits with tomato, baby spinach, bacon, scrambled eggs, not poached =(  , cheese, and a mixture of onions, peppers, etc. with a spin on the traditional hollandaise sauce. Great meal - lots of food. Oh, and the third mistake we made - the waitress indicated that there was a $3 charge for splitting the plate and suggested we order a side dish, in which case, we wouldn't be charged $3. So, instead, we ordered a $5 bowl of mashed potatoes with cheese and bacon (which was really good) but could have also been shared with another two people. 

BTW - I give 3 stars because for all the hype, I would have expected a wider selection of breakfast fare on the dinner menu. I'd go back, but only for breakfast."
154,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great service and food... Someone complained that the biscuits were dry, but listen my friends, that is why God created sausage gravy! Delicious"
155,Hash House A Go Go,5,Fantastic food but way too much food waste.  Fantastic service.  Long wait that moved fast. Had the crab Benedict which was drool worthy.  I highly recommend.
156,Hash House A Go Go,3,"When you close down a club in Vegas and you want nothing but diner food, this is the only option you really have because very few places are even open in the middle of the strip.  So this place is always packed around 3-4:00 AM.  And at that hour, expect the crowd to also be intoxicated.

The food portions are HUGE, seriously share a dish with someone..maybe even 2 people. The food itself is OK, not as good as a typical diner dish but it hits the spot when you just need food.

Service is a bit slow and when you are drunk, hungry and sleepy...this isn't a plus.

It is really loud in here but once you get that giant portion of food..you don't really care.

I'll probably go back if I'm in that area again and I have no other choices.  If I could find ANY other places, I'd more likely try something new before having to come back here."
157,Hash House A Go Go,2,"A very bad experience overall. The only good thing was the service but the place had a bad smell, the food was not good also. We had two burgers and it was just disgusting. We ate most of it because thats how hungry we were but really can't believe how well rated this place is. Don't spend your
Time and money coming here. There are waaay better restaurants in Vegas."
158,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best breakfast ever!! Great staff and service !! Large .. I mean VERY LARGE PORTIONS for your hunger satisfaction !! He there early though BC it does get packed during the later hours of the day and the wait time is not pleasant! I mean who could blame them.. The food there is that good !!
159,Hash House A Go Go,2,We were disappointed overall. The salads were good however the hash was not at all. Sad since this is their namesake we expected it would at least be good but that wasn't the case. Would not recommend & prices are inflated for what you get.
160,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I am sorry but I think this place is over rated. Or maybe its the huge serving sizes that get people so excited and drunk with food intoxication. We had a party of 4, My hubby & I split the Sage fried chicken salad, the chicken crispy & heavily breaded & dry. I could not taste even a hint of sage. The salad was pretty odd mix of stuff but it worked, green apples, pecans, tomatoes and greens with a complimentary dressing. Our friends were not overly impressed with their orders, one got the Caesar salad and the other a sandwich which was so unremarkable I can't remember. We saw some of the dishes at other tables and they could feed 4 people with one serving. The Chicken and waffles looked like Mt Everest...Oh and our server while attentive acted like we were boring her when we asked questions prior to ordering. It was all business."
161,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions. Open late night. Breakfast food is always good. The wait was a bit long for to go but they gave us extra syrup (so exciting).
162,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was delicious.  I didn't get any breakfast food. But I did get one of their stuffed burgers and it was greasy, cheesy, and messy. Oh hell yeah!! (Stone Cold voice)

Bring a bib and stretch pants. You're in for a doozy.... woo (Ric Flair)

The only complaint I have is with the plating. Too much going on, that is in the way of my meal. I spent 30 seconds pulling off sage stems, some orange straw, and other stuff."
163,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Stumbled across Hash-House-A-Go-Go's menu on the Internet and couldn't WAIT to try it when we got to Vegas. I was stuck trying to decide between the Sausage Gravy Pot Pie (which seemed like a perfect cure for my Vegas hangover) and the Chicken & Waffles. I ended up opting for the Chicken & Waffles because the server said it was the second most popular item on the menu. My boyfriend ordered the first, Man VS. Food's top pick, the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The portions were ginormous, easily shareable, and the prices were reasonable (for Vegas). Plus, they're open 24hrs, so it's perfect for drunk munchies or a hungover brunch."
164,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place was recommended to me and I am so glad it was.  6 of us dined here and everyone was pleased with their meal.  My very discerning Aunt LOVED the grilled cheese sandwich.  It takes a lot to please her.  We are definitely coming back when we are in Vegas!  There are many other things I want to try.
165,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Bring your post inebriated-self to hash house for a meal hefty enough 
to absorb all that alcohol still coasting through your body. The wait here can be horrendous, especially during brunch hours so either make reservations or bring a snack with you lol.

Btw, If you have ATT&T, you won't get phone reception so save your mobile photo uploading for later.

Because it's so busy, the service seems to suffer a little bit, we asked
Several times for drinks, utensils etc before they actually brought them out. So minus a star for that. Also, the tables are positioned unusually high. I suppose it puts your mouth closer to the food, so that cant be a bad thing.

The menu is large enough for varying tastes, but they do offer Andy's sage fried chicken with either waffles, benedict, pancakets etc. We ordered the sage fried chicken benedict, sausage gravy pot pie and bacon waffle. 

The wait for the food seemed like forever. Well it literally was. I believe it took approximately 40 minutes from the time we placed the order til its arrival to our table. Luckily we were so astonished by the size of the platters that all complaints dwindled away quickly.  The plates are massive, enough for a number of people to share. 

Sage fried chicken benedict was delicious, a bit heavy handed on the sauce but every aspect of that plate was super good. The sausage pot pie was impressive looking but you the biscuit dish spaceship thing was really hard and almost crackerlike. Not what you would expect from something named ""pot pie"". Tons of sausage though and the gravy was bomb. The bacon waffle was a bit of a disappointment. I thought there would be bacon pieces integrated with the batter, so you'd get a hint of saltiness in every sweet bite, but unfortunately it was whole bacon pieces that were dressed in waffle. If that makes any sense.

I hear the bloody mary was awesome, and like their meals, they serve it large.

Overall, my biggest issue was the sloth-like nature of the service. The food itself wasn't spectacular as you would hope, but definitely impressive enough for a second or third visit. (Photos to follow)"
166,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Absolutely delicious! Overly generous portions! Excellent prices for what you get.  Clean and inviting atmosphere, amazing customer service.  Will return my next visit to Vegas!  I highly recommend this restaurant."
167,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Friendly and fast service, amazing food, huge portions, creative and delicious cocktails and coffee drinks, I loved it!"
168,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came in here on Christmas day, not knowing what I was getting myself into. Before getting seated, I realized that this is the place Adam visited on the show 'Man vs Food'. That got me pretty excited, and I kept reading the comments on the wall of fame about the amazing Chicken waffles.

Let's first start of by saying that the portions at this place are HUGE. So sharing is definitely caring - and necessary at Hash House A Go Go.

The Chicken Waffles is basically a ginormous plate consisting of 5 or 6 Belgian waffles, decorated with two big pieces of fried chicken. The chicken  was perfectly seasoned and had that special ""crunch"" to it. It was 95% meat, so no playing around with bones and stuff  - just serious Chick'n business!
But overall, it's just waffles and a fried chicken, so nothing to really get excited about. Service is so-so. You don't really feel special, and the servers are not super attentive. 

Not sure if it is a ""must visit"", but if you're around and just want to experience something different in terms of.. well, not really different, but just overwhelming in the sense of portion.. then hit up to Imperial Palace, and visit Hash House.

And don't forget to use your Total Rewards player's card when you pay!"
169,Hash House A Go Go,5,Full stop...hand to heart...a.must.experience. The food and staff are amazing!! The people watching is great too!
170,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is unbelievable!!  If you want quantity, this is it!!  I had ordered the Chicken and Waffle.  So BIG!!  The waffle had smoke bacon in it.  So delicious.  I would have given a 4 star but my white chicken was way over fried, however, the crust was very tasty.  Service was wonderful."
171,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had the best corned beef hash ever! It was so fresh! It came with two eggs as well.

Mom ordered the eggs with a pancake and sausage.

Boyfriend had the man vs. food Sage fried chicken Benedict and it was hugeeee!

Only downside was the 45 minute wait bc of it's popularity. 

Huge portions and great food."
172,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is quite good but this review is based on myself going solo.  I was able to walk in and sit at the counter, order, and eat within 25 minutes.  Had it been more than myself I'd have waited 2 hours and probably have gone elsewhere.  The portions are enormous and you should be splitting with at least one other person.  Overall though, a must stop when in Vegas."
173,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I went awhile back, but didn't get the chance to write a review yet so here we go!

This was my first time here and my family and I walked here all the way from Excalibur. That was a super long and cold walk! So once we finally got there, we were all starving! There was like 14 of us, but it didn't take long for us to be seated so yay! Me and my sister wanted to try the sage fried chicken and waffles for sure so we decided to get to different items and we would just split it. 

What we got:
Mildford Fried Chicken Sandwich($13): it was huge! I could barely eat half of the sandwich and my sister couldn't even eat it at all. It was just too much food for the both of us. As for the side dish, we got the basil pesto crispy potatoes. Those were delicious! It was so good I kept scraping the bottom of the dish to get all of the sauce. Yummy!

Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles($19): ...that was delicious too! The chicken was full of flavor and crunchy...yummy...The waffles were super thick though and that's the reason we got full so fast...We did however finish the chicken, but not the waffles. I loved the fried leeks on there was well. It was very flavorful and even though I was stuffed I still sat there chewing on that as I waited for the rest of my family to finish. Or well...attempt to finish all their food.

Service:
Great! Our server was super friendly and my baby cousin really wanted fruit so our server saw that so he personally went to get him some fruit! It was so sweet of him and you could see the smile on my baby cousin when he brought it out. 

Overall, everything was great!"
174,Hash House A Go Go,1,"20 min wait for a table. Then our server tells us it's gonna be at least 30 min till we get our food......on a Wednesday at 11:30 am. 

Hell no. We walked out. 

We won't be back ever......to any hash house."
175,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food is delicious and worth the wait u could even share a plate..we waited 1 1/2 for a group 7 on a Saturday around noon
176,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is phenomenal. It would get 5 stars if the service was better. Not saying it was bad at all, just slow."
177,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy gigantic portions of food batman!

My friend recommended this place so even though I am on expense account and can get away with the 50 buck dinner places I thought I'd give this a try.  

I ordered one of the nightly specials, the 'lamb chop hash'.  First, the server brought a giant honey covered biscuit with a side of butter.  You have to eat this with a fork and you really don't need the butter.  The biscuit would have been a tad dry if not for the honey, but it worked and I ate most of it.  Which was probably a mistake, because soon after a gigantic skillet with enough food for three people arrived.  In this skillet was a generous serving of delicious, fluffy scrambled eggs that did not taste like they were over milked but were fluffy on their own, some delicious garlicky green beans, some cooked carrot slices, sliced red and orange bell pepper, a metric buttload of roasted potato chunks and four lamb chops. With a sprig of rosemary.    Holy guacamole*!  (*there was no guacamole)

I sort of made a dent - I ate all the lamb chops (great), all the green beans (great), all the eggs (great), a good amount of the peppers, a few of the carrots and a couple bites of potato.

Ironically enough the potatoes were the weakest part.  I'd like them cut smaller and crispier.  But heck, everything else was good and there was WAY too much food.

This dinner was $18.99+tax.  A very, very good deal for the strip and it tasted pretty good too.  Honestly I'd prefer a smaller portion since I hate wasting food and most people on the strip won't have a way to deal with leftovers.  But, if you come with a companion who likes to eat the same food, you could easily share one of these if you asked for an extra plate."
178,Hash House A Go Go,5,What can I say! Amazing!! I was there on July 16th.  We beat the rush!! When we left it was crowded so get there early!! I had the pancakes the portions are extra large even the child's menu but so worth it!!
179,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Such flavorful food and generous portions. The hostess and servers were super friendly, funny, and helpful. Not to mention patient and provided perfect recommendations. Definitely try the 1st Benedict on the menu sage friend chicken something or other. It was more than enough for two people. Plus the BLT Bloody Mary was tasty! Not too spicy but just a little kick!"
180,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So the first time we tried come here, the line was out the door and down the stairs. An hour wait they said.... Nope.

So we came later around 7 pm and there were maybe 3 other patrons. Which was great because we were on our way to a Vegas show after and we couldn't wait long.

Anyways I ordered a mojito, fried green tomatoes and we split the Chicken and Waffles.

The waiter was enthusiastic and I really liked him. I told him I didn't really enjoy the mojito and he was really cool about it. 

The fried green tomatoes were really beautifully delivered. They rate great too. But if I had a particular critique I'd say the batter the tomatoes in were flavorless and it kinda brought down the dish.

The wait to get my main entree was insane. Especially since there were only 3 other customers. I mean how long does it take to throw some chicken in a skillet and put some waffles in a waffle maker? Not 45 minutes.

But honestly the wait was worth it. Those sage chicken and waffles were amazing. Really.. Really... Amazing.

So yeah. I'll come back and I'll bring patience with me."
181,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Located in the Quad, second floor. It can be a little confusing to get to because of the layout between the hotel and the parking garage but just follow signs and ask the employees. :] 

It is much like the Hash House in San Diego with the exception of the casino/smoke smell. Menu and dishes are exactly the same and if you have never been to Hash House, just a little warning - the dishes are huge! My BF and I decided to share instead of ordering one each since these dishes are a pretty decent size. We ordered the roasted chicken scramble with eggs, mushroom, and bell peppers. Got the crispy potatoes and fruit to go with. It was the perfect amount of food for two. :]

FRIENDLY TIP: If you're going for brunch, get there early (before 10am) because the lines get extremely long. Also, the kitchen cook time took about 40 minutes which the waitress notified us before sitting down."
182,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I've always loved hash house, great food and bloody Mary's. However last night watching the beyond poor customer service was sad. A young lady walked in very intoxicated ordered then passed out w/ her head on the table. No one tried to wake her get her water, make sure she was ok, or get her out. the waiter dropped off her food w/o saying a word, countless wait staff walked by her as she slept for 45 minutes before a manager came out, he tried to wake her then just left.. Customers were asking if she was ok if she needed help. Finally after almost an hour the young lady embarrassed got up and left. I asked the hostess what there policy was for leaving people like that she just shrugged and walked off.  Yes we're in Vegas and yes she was drunk but who's to say she didn't have a medical condition?? Also it's sad that customers were more concerned about her safety then the people who worked there."
183,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Extremely heavy but great food! I would say grab one and a half plates since one dish is large enough to nibble and share with someone!

Great atmosphere and friendly staff"
184,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Why did I wait in line to experience this?  It was a mediocre experience, at best."
185,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Portion size is huge so be sure to share with someone! Was looking forward to the sage chicken waffles - big disappointment. The fried chicken was just okay and the waffles were too soggy. Nothing special about the dish. We also ordered the quesadillas with chorizo, it's alright - better than the sage chicken waffles. We waited about 30 minutes for our food and that was a bit too long in my opinion. I am in awe how others rated this restaurant and no near a 4 stars - perhaps it's the portion size that's worth the 4 stars."
186,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Thanks for treating my friends so good today. The food and service was wonderful.
If you're traveling in LV and need a good place for food this is very much worth it!
Good portions and very nice service"
187,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best dinning in Vegas we had. Wait was shorter than they quoted. - FOOD was phenomenal  which made up for the less attentive wait staff. Chicken and waffles can feed two, but you won't want to share, the drinks even the flavored coffee's were delicious. So packed so crowded so rushed was my only complaint. No time for the staff to really answer questions, very limited wait staff interaction, so just read the reviews here first might help."
188,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The biggest chicken pot pie you'll ever see in your life. It's honestly enough to feed 3 hungry people, not even kidding. The food was great, some of the meals are insanely huge. If you leave this place hungry, you did something really wrong."
189,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our breakfast was outstanding!  It was a fun atmosphere, the food was good and came in huge portions and our server, Lousia was amazing."
190,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was really good, the wait time was not so bad. 

Our waiter sucked, he was not accommodating our request and pushing back on our taste buds."
191,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you want to try something different and unique, this is the place come to . I am amazed with every single plate that came out . The only bad thing it's too much food to finish .
I got the waffle chicken and my wife got the corn beef hash ."
192,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and service!!!!!!  Huge portions.  The fried chicken meal could feed a small family but is so good, you'll want to eat it all yourself."
193,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Heard wonderful things about this place and their infamous sage fried chicken Benedict so I had to give it a try! Came here with about 10 of my friends, we were all holding our Fat Tuesday drinks in our hands and the employees were cool enough to let us in with our drinks. The sage fried chicken Benedict definitely lived up to the hype, although I wish I was hungrier to finish it all. My friend and I shared it and we still weren't able to finish it. You can truly taste the sage and each bite was so flavorful."
194,Hash House A Go Go,3,"You must come here for the food. The wait is a let down. Especially if you have a group. We waited an hour and twenty minutes for a table. Then another hour for food. They really seemed short staffed, but I can't fault our server for that. She did what she could but gets a star deducted. Didn't want to spend that much time waiting on a meal. I suggest sharing as the plates are nicely sized.  The Man vs Food entree has to be eaten. It's good!  Sage fried chicken Benedict! Yum."
195,Hash House A Go Go,2,"More like hash house a no no ...

I was EXCITED to try this place and I've seen pictures about the HUGE portions. Came with a group of 8. I get this place is always packed but their seatings were ALL over the place and they somehow messed up. After we were seated, our waitress came over, took our order and .......... no food .......... no food ........ no food. Our friends were seated about 5 minutes after us, yet their food arrived before ours did! Frustrated, we asked our waitress. She said our ticket was 2 away and it would take a couple minutes. 15 minutes later, she said it would take another couple minutes. Our food finally came and it was just okay. I tried my friends waffle and it was chewy and soggy! Gross. My sage chicken or what not was just okay. What a let down."

Brunch. Vegas. Hangover-worthy. Hair of the dog. Welcome to Hash House a Go Go. I had checked into my hotel on Yelp, it posted on Twitter and a friend recommended we come down to The Quad and eat here.  Looks Good!  And off we walked.  We took a leisurely stroll from Mandalay Bay all the way up the strip and into The Quad and found HHAGG.  Wowza, it was packed.  We put in our name (5 people) and they told us 45 minutes to an hour.  They directed us to the left to order a cocktail while we waited and were told there might be a place to sit down in the bar.  A couple of us went in to get coffees and found us 5 seats at the bar - Score!

We sat down and were introduced to Kye, with her spiky locks, and Tiffany - a duo full of personality and who ""pour the cocktails like we like to drink them!""  Okay, I'm sold!  A couple of us ordered Irish coffees - knock me on my ass - while we perused the menu.  So many options.  Thanks to Yelp, I had narrowed it down and knew I wanted the Sage Fried Chicken - problem is that it appears in 4 different places on the menu!! Oy!

After much debate, and recommendations from Tiffany, I opted for something from the ""Indiana Favorites"" section of the menu.  This was the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit.  I asked for my eggs to be scrambled with cheddar cheese.  When the plate came - holy moly that's a lotta food!  The biscuit was the size of a softball with a sprig of rosemary stuck in the top.  

The potatoes were delightful - smashed and the bacon was not super crispy, which I love. The reduction of maple was like crack.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and salted - they did need some pepper.  As for the chicken, it was not fried enough.  The crust was a bit doughy and tasted of flour - clearly they were dealing with a lot of covers and quality control suffered. Not acceptable.  Luckily, the rest of my meal was great, but I would probably go with something else next time.  My friend got the pork tenderloin - impeccably fried.  Golden brown and delicious!

Now let's talk cocktails - strong, powerful, strong.  We enjoyed ourselves so much with Kye and Tiffany, we started doing shots.  Watching them craft drinks and deliver food - I wanted to come back over and over and try every food item and fancy drink.  Plus, they were a delight to talk to and have serve us.

I'll be going back each trip for sure and I have already recommended it to a friend going to Vegas in a couple of weeks. HHAGG is the place to eat."
197,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Tourists trap! I admit I got sucked in. All the reviews and great press from the tv show diners drive ins and dives drew us here. Yes the portions are huge, Yes the food is good, yes you will be paying through the nose and yes you will have have or more of your plate of food thrown out because the portions are GIANT. I recommend if you visit split one plate between 2 or 3. NO JOKE! It's that big. I felt bad throwing that food out. Being a visitor in LV I don't have any way to store the food at my hotel (mini fridge is filled with food and drinks if disturbed will charge) or even reheat it if I wanted. So food flavor gets 3 the presentation is nice 4, but price (overpriced) is a 2 for sure. So combined I guess that's a 3. Bloody Mary was $15.00 with up-charge for anything other than well, waitress neglected to mention. she just asked what vodka we preferred as she rattled off a few names."
198,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions; friendly service. Typical  Vegas coffee shop. I ended up here because the buffet is no longer open for breakfast. I ordered some mega breakfast. The chicken portion was cold. Once the server knew it was gone and replaced with a hot plate. Food was tasty, albeit too much to eat. Ah, but that's the beauty of Vegas. We forgive ourselves for our sins!"
199,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Over hyped. There I said it. Don't be hating, I just wasn't blown away and after seeing words like ''amazing'', ''exceptional'' and ''spectacular'' appearing in so many reviews I did expect more than the very average tasting Chicken and Waffles I had. Ok, portions are huge but that is the exact reason why America has an obesity problem. Half the portions, increase the quality and you're onto a winner Hash House.

Located inside The Quad this place is a bitch to find. It's on the 2nd floor and accessible from an escalator in a dark corner of the ground floor, you really have to be paying attention to the signs and directions.
Once inside the place is large and the staff inviting. The menu consists of Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner with your usual American fare. Knowing from the Yelp pictures before we came the portions were big we decided to order just one Entree to share and see how we go with that before ordering more.

- Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=WMlwV0h4FJ210s5htktfYg#qbOfWBSEnFvS3S5Kvu9uBA) The Waffles have Bacon cooked into them and comes with Leeks. The presentation was great, piled high and held together with a huge steak knife, truly a beast of a meal.
My Husband and I found the Chicken to be a little dry and the coating oily. It also had a strong flour taste where too much had been used before the egg wash and crumb coating. The Waffles and Syrup were good if you took out the Bacon (consisted of more fat than meat) and the Leeks really added nothing to the dish, do people even eat them?
The portion was large enough for Breakfast between two of us though as we didn't even manage to finish it, how one person could eat that much in one sitting is beyond me.

Bottom line? Disappointing experience, I'm glad I did come here after wanting to for so long but am not likely to return. I guess it's the kind of place you come once just to say you have been. 

Probably more 2.5 / 5. I'm too generous..."
200,Hash House A Go Go,4,A must to-do when in Las Vegas.  It has become a family tradition.  Only problem is the ventilation.  Sometimes it reeks of smoke.
201,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here after a late night at the strip looking for something to ease the hangover. After waiting for our table for an hour we
Were finally seated, not really a foul though because we came in at about 1, right during lunch/brunch rush on a Saturday. 
Highlights:
-They have fresh squeezed orange juice
-Awesome bloody marries
-Portions are literally ginormous- most of them could feed three people. 
- food was good, heavy and just what a hangover needs. 

Overall good Vegas atmosphere and good hangover food. Type of place you need to be rolled out of after you're done eating!"
202,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Definitely hits the spot after going out. The portions are huge! I usually eat and finish a meal when going out, but after ordering here I had half my meal left! Eat here and leave full with more food eat later."
203,Hash House A Go Go,4,Delicious!  Generous portions and great taste!  Had their chicken pot pie!  Would definitely come back and highly recommend to others.
204,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Was kind of disappointed. The flavor was great, but had an issue with a waiter. It seemed like he spat in one of our drinks, but was told it needed to be mixed. I work with food and do not necessarily mix things close to my mouth. Called the next day to talk to the manager and was dealt with more questions as to why I did not resolve it the day before (3am after a night of drinking). Never even got a call back after he said he would talk to another manager. The chicken and waffle was good, but need more flavor too."
205,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was amazing portions were great,  waiters were awesome only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the hostesses were very rude it's a very busy place so you'd expect them to be able to be professional and nice to there customers no matter what is going on"
206,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went here on a Sunday after checking out of hotel.  The wait was not too bad for 2 people about 30-40 minutes.  The food was great, we shared and it was defiantly a good idea.  The portions are very large but it's a must to check out!"
207,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Temperature of waiting area and restaurant waaaaaay too warm. Kitchen management poor as food for our group of 5 came out in spurts. Waitress noticeably annoyed with the kitchen. 
Food over-all average/good (but not nearly as good as HH in San Diego; where's my biscuit with honey?) Biscuit and butter sans butter. Side of biscuit and gravy with about half of the volume of gravy needed to satisfy the biscuit and my appetite. Two children ordered cereal which came out in large Hash House sized bowels but, alas, filled no more than a fifth of the way at best and served with a scientifically measured 1/2 cup of milk. 
Good if you want the experience of large portions of twisted farm food, but my feeling is that high production volumes have lead to lower quality product as compared to other HH venues."
208,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is amazing! Don't be discouraged with the large crowds and wait time. Turnaround is relatively fast and the seating area is a lot bigger than it looks. We had an amazing upbeat server which made the experience that much better. Portion sizes are large. Definitely shareable. Biscuits and gravy were fluffy and savory. They also make a decent Bloody Mary and delicious milkshake!!
209,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The location downtown is better. Ordered the basic again and got it to go. Ordered an extra biscuit instead of meat.   The wait is over 30 minutes. This place was not busy but everything is claimed to be made from scratch.  When I got to my room (upstairs in the Linq) the food was slightly cold, the biscuit was terrible, I didn't have the extra biscuit and wasn't told that the to go order doesn't come with the jelly.  Took it back. Upset now bc I walked there, waited for food and had to walk back. (I didn't have a microwave in my room- if I did I may have just nuked it). The second time around the food took forever to come out.  It was ok.  The downtown location is still better.  The shining light through all of this was the bar tender who took my order. I didn't have an attitude and neither did he. (He didn't have a reason to have an attitude) He was very nice."
210,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The Breakfast/Brunch scene I guess is kind of a big deal here in L.A...In Vegas, its non existent. SInce I could not find a place with a ""scene"" I would have to settle for which place has the best food..THIS PLACE IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST!!! The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict with a Bananna Brown Sugar Pancake is what I and and HOT DAMN I was in heaven! Make sure you share your plate though..I can almost guarantee you will not even finish half of it!!"
211,Hash House A Go Go,5,Tried this place for the first time and it was good af. The portions are big and the price was fair.
212,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Unlike CafÃ© Bellagio, Hash House definitely knows how to make a hash (it is part of their name, after all)!  Delicious food and giant servings?  Talk about a tasty (and filling) way to start the day.  People working on the Strip definitely know what's up:

Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy:  Where are we going this morning, sir?
Me:  Imperial Palace, please.
Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy:  Ahhh...good ole Hash House!
Me:  Yup, you got it.
Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy (to cab driver): The Imperial!
Cab Driver:  Ahh...he means Hash House!
Me:  Man, how do you guys know?
Cab Driver:  Well, it's a Sunday morning and since it looks like you're staying at Cosmo, really no other reason why you would want to go to the Imperial.  
Me:  Haha...ouch.

Even though a lot of the dishes that passed by our table looked great, I stayed true to my original craving - the Chorizo Hash.  Man, talk about a massive serving of food!  My photo may not do it justice, but the cast iron skillet they brought out was huge, and the hash alone took up about half of it.  The other half?  Choice of eggs (scrambled), fruit, and a biscuit.  Not that it mattered in the end though since I barely cleared half of my order.

Sitting on top of soft and perfectly cooked chunks of potatoes was a tasty pile of ground chorizo.  YUM.  The ""taco meat""-like consistency was a little unexpected, but the seasoning of the ground chorizo and melted cheese was great.  Just a slight kick while the jalapenos gave it that extra heat.  All in all - deliciousness.

While I've heard of stories about the long waits at Hash House, we lucked into a short 5-10 minute wait for a table of five.  Since we were there on Easter Sunday though, I imagine it might have been a little quieter than normal.  Still, knowing how good (and generous) the food is though, I wouldn't mind having to wait (a little)."
213,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Heavy emphasis that the food was made from SCRATCH. What does that mean? If they are trying to make it clear that they are not just reheating frozen meals, then thank you for doing that. But it is a diner/restaurant so I already assumed they were making the food from what they call ""scratch"". Then they said because all of the food is made from SCRATCH, it would take longer to prepare. Of course this was just an excuse to take 45 minutes to make my eggs and French toast. Idk exactly how they made the bacon from scratch, but I know they went out to the nearest maple tree and pumped the maple syrup. Oh and of course the freshly squeezed orange juice, straight from the tropicana bottle! Food was good tho, welcome to Vegas."
214,Hash House A Go Go,4,"went after the Matt Franco show, didn't know the whole menu isn't all day (was looking forward to more breakfast options as I had a few years ago when I went for breakfast). But I still tried the bacon bloody mary and we split some breakfast food, service was perfect and food was great. 5 stars if I had access to all the great breakfast choices but was still great!"
215,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I wish I could give this place 10 stars. We ate here almost daily. Open 24 hours (a must in Las Vegas), great service, food was amazing and all fresh ingredients, hands down best coffee anywhere, and I am a huge coffee drinker. There is usually a wait (which is a good sign to me) but place is big so it is quick. It is located right in Linq hotel so very convenient if you stay there or at Flamingo. I wish there was one in South Florida!! Do yourself a favor and eat here at least once.. you will go back again."
216,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was amazing. With this many reviews the wait was expected. Service was great no complaints here well worth it.
217,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Since i saw this place on man Vs. Food i had to give it a try.   Located in the dumpy Imperial Hotel. 

Had the Chicken Benedict and like others have said its massive.  Very tasty big mess of a food.    It was good but not great.  I should have had the meatloaf.

Service was great and the atmosphere 100 X better than anything in the Imperial.

If your a Man Vs Food Fan give it a try.  if not there are probably a lot of better options in the area."
218,Hash House A Go Go,2,Eh. Overhyped...the food was ridiculously over sized. The pancake felt like it was just all bread. The price was a little too much for what you get. The Orange juice and tea and any drink we ordered seemed to have a weird taste in it. Overall did not like the place. We had to wait  1 hour and 15 min for a seat and maybe another 45min-1 hour before we got our food. Will not go here ever again. Thanks.
219,Hash House A Go Go,5,This became my new favorite spot to go to in Vegas! Large portions on everything and it all looks good with decent prices. The sage fried chicken benedict is what you need to get when you go here. Amazing food only bad thing is the wait but it is all worth it. Just have a drink or two from the bar while you sit and wait. I can't wait to go back.
220,Hash House A Go Go,5,Inside the Linq. Tuesday 9pm. No wait. Amazing food. Loved the chicken Benedict. Huge portions! Also loved The French toast. No complaints!! I'll be back!
221,Hash House A Go Go,2,"One of my friends moved to Las Vegas a few months ago and highly recommended that we check out this place when I came to visit. On our first attempt, there was a 90 minute wait for breakfast/brunch (ummm... no) so we left. The second time we tried, the wait was much shorter. 

I was annoyed by the fact that the hostess was not taking names in the order that we had lined up. People decided to walk in the front of the line and get their name on the list while the rest of us stood there waiting. She kept stopping to address other people instead who came up to talk to her instead of getting us out of the way and then addressing their concerns.

We almost missed our reservation because, even though I spelled my name AND pronounced it for her (my name is a fairly common English word, so...),  she mangled it so horribly (how?!) that we didn't know what the hell she was even saying. She kept calling this weird name that nobody seemed to respond to, so my party got up to see if it was our party she was calling. Good thing we did...

We got seated and the waiter comes to our table and exclaims ""Girls!! How are we today?"" You could practically feel the collective bristle at the table from that. I'm absolutely certain the waiter meant no harm by it and was just trying (a little too hard, we'd later find) to be friendly, but all of us are highly educated, professional women over 30 and we haven't been ""girls"" in a very long time. ""Ladies"" would have been a much more acceptable, and respectful, term.

Anyway, the waiter is so busy being ""on"" that he rushes through our drink orders and doesn't give me a chance to give mine. I finally get to order the lemonade while another guest in our party ordered the watermelon lemonade. It has vodka in it, which I can't drink, but I heard that it was very good. It looked beautiful. Huge points for aesthetics! The regular lemonade I had was just the right balance or tart and sweet and and made with real, honest to goodness *gasp* lemons! 

My best friend and I decided to split the chicken and waffles dish that we'd heard so much about, while the other person in our party ordered one if the hash plates, served in a cast iron skillet. The chicken and waffles looked like a huge portion, but after the breading started to break off of my chicken, I realized that it wasn't as much as it appeared to be. Plus, I wasn't a big fan of the Indiana-style sage fried thing they had going on. The waffles were ok. They  normally cook slices of bacon into the waffles, but we got the bacon on the side. They gave us 4 waffles in our order, but barely enough syrup for 2. The other person in our party enjoyed her hash plate though,  which was a huge portion that came with eggs, a biscuit the size of a small pillow and a few thin slivers of cantaloupe and a few berries on the side.

Overall, the meal didn't live up to the hype for me. I really expected a much better dining experience given all the hype I'd heard about it beforehand.  Maybe if I'd gone in blind and not knowing much about it, I wouldn't have left so unimpressed."
222,Hash House A Go Go,3,Food was good I'm so glad that I had a chance to go back  again. I forgot my servers name but she was friendly and the manager was nice as well.
223,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We came here for lunch and there was an hour wait for a table but we really wanted to try the food so we waited. We are so glad we waited, it was worth every minute of waiting. Our server was awesome, friendly and eager to please. The drinks were great, I had a frozen strawberry Margarita which was so good. The the food came out! I could not pick on anything to do with the food. It was amazing. I had the chicken Benedict and it was perfect. Serving sizes are enormous and I couldn't finish it. Really great value for the amount of food served. Would love to go again but as we are from Australia we will just have to keep craving the food until next time."
224,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're in Las Vegas, you must stop by Hash House A Go Go. This place has amazing food. Service is sometimes questionable (hence the 4 stars), but I've never been disappointed with the food. 

During our New Years trip to Vegas this year, we stopped by once for their amazing late night stuffed burgers and then again a few days later for a family brunch. The portions here are HUGE, duh, but the food is really amazing. 

Looking for a suggestion??? The chicken and waffles is a must, the stuffed burgers are out of this world, the vanilla, bacon filled waffles are another must and the banana and brown sugar pancakes are the best best pancakes you will EVER have. Promise.

Give them a chance because you won't be disappointed. Don't go in with high expectations for the service, they always seem to be under staffed, but the quality of the food makes up for it."
225,Hash House A Go Go,1,This was or first and last time we will be dining in this place the food has no taste and our waitress was a ratchet with a bad attitude after she brought one of our order and it wasn't ready I would like to know how they serve their customers with a stack of pancake that is raw on the inside they should keep it and eat it themselves
226,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Visited the Hash House A Go Go for the first time during our Vegas trip on 8/16/15, and OMG the food was just AMAZING! I had already heard raving review's about the restaurant but wow this place really is DELICIOUS. 

We of course did have to wait about 40 minutes to be seated but it wasn't too bad since we were able order drinks at the bar to enjoy during our wait. I ordered the bloody Mary and it was perfection, to think I don't even like them but this one was just right. Our waiter was extremely friendly and very enthusiastic which made the whole experience fun. 

I ordered S'mores mocha based off of someone else's raving yelp reviews and i'm so glad I ordered it because it had to be THE BEST MOCHA I've ever had! 

For my meal ordered The Tractor Driver Combo - Two Eggs w/ bacon & sausage a side of potatoes with 1 blueberry pecan flapjack, WHICH WAS PERFECTION! Everything had so much flavor it was all very delicious. Oh and did I mention the portions ARE HUGE, most def want to share. 

I wish there was a Hash House A Go Go in NORCAL I guess for now i'll just have to visit San Diego or Vegas. :)"
227,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Well....I have never seen portions as big as this in my entire life. Food was great, service great, atmosphere great. We had a fun breakfast with friends drinking mimosa's from stilleto glasses. The queue was huge, but, we were seated quickly. My husband had the chicken and waffles and he said it was the best chicken ever. So, go and visit. Take a jumper though the aircon is epic.
Thanks for a great experience."
228,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food and portion sizes here are insane!! Unfortunately, I cannot remember our waitress' name but she was an absolute doll! The setting of the place gives you the feel of a true right-at-home, comfort food spot complete with cow print chairs and retro rock music. It's very lax but the garnish and finish of these plates give a totally different feel; they're beautifully detailed! Also, the staff was kind enough to replicate a favorite drink of ours from back home in Philly (a Tokyo Tea) and they nailed it! We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here as we did our leftovers at about 1am because we left the restaurant with still a serving's worth of food even on an empty stomach. 

I wanna go back for the Snicker's Bread Pudding!"
229,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place.  Big Portions.  We had the Basic Breakfast and the Chicken and waffels.  Both were good and the C&W was 14"" high.  Place is big, so wait was minimal.  Server was nice and food came quickly.  The biscut that came wiht the Basic is hugh and very good.  They serve some kind of jam with it and that was not overly sweet and compimented the biscuit well."
230,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Sage Fried Chicken Benedict!!! Please just order it and indulge.  It is sooooo fattening, but it is a once in a life time experience.  I loved it, but could only eat a 1/4th of it.  It could feed three adults, but is worth it.  A must try!"
231,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband and I shared one meal (chicken fried steak) and got a side of 2 scrambled eggs and a side of Crispy Potatoes.  It was about 11 am. The wait was about 45 minutes.  
With two sodas, The bill came came to only $38 making it the cheapest place we have ever eaten in Las Vegas. 
The food was delicious, and we were so stuffed, we made ourselves walk the miracle mile shops and then went back to our room and napped, and skipped dinner because we were still so full. 
When we woke up the next morning, I asked my husband, ""what if we are never hungry again??"" 
We were not hungry again until after noon the next day after sharing that ONE meal!  
Highly recommend!"
232,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We went here on a Friday morning. Had about a 20 minute wait, which was not bad, considering how packed it was. Our food was excellent. Would probably split it next time. We all had pancakes. It was the size of a medium pizza. Service was good. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the noise level in the dining room was VERY loud. We could barely hear each other talk. We will go back again on our next trip for sure!"
233,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food is amazing. However the staff was horrible. My mother and I came in at 10:45 looking to eat off the lunch menu but when we were seated, we were told that lunch doesn't start for another 15 mins so we had already ordered our drinks, so we paid for the drinks and asked if we could wait in the waiting area for another table in 15 minutes. Now, if I was the waiter, I would have suggested that we just stay put and chat for ten minutes, and he would put our order in 5 minutes til 11 but he did not. In fact he looked at us like we were crazy. The least he could have done is helped up with our drinks to the lounge area or suggested that he keep the ticket open so we did not have to pay twice. He did not. We went to the front area and the hostess knew we were waiting til 11:00 am. Guess what, they forgot about us. Here is the kicker..we finally get seated and we look over to another table who were there previously, and they were EATTING LUNCH!!!"
234,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We stopped in here because the Studio Buffet had a huge line. I had a coupon as well. But as I headed toward the restaurant I realized the coupon was only good for dinner. But we decided to try it anyway. I've been to the one on Sahara and it was good.

The waiter took our order and came right back with our drinks. It took longer for our meals. My husband ordered 3 egg breakfast with sausage and scrambled eggs. They brought him 1 1/2 eggs and the breakfast fries were cremated. He couldn't eat them. I ordered the upside down chicken pot pie. I'm not sure who invented this but they should lose the recipe. It was beautifully presented but it was awful. It was served in a thick hard cracker. The filling had no salt and was so bland. I ate the chicken out of it.

I saw the french toast and the eggs benedict. They looked really good. I don't know if we miss ordered or all the food is bad.

The restaurant is beautiful and easy to get to in the hotel. I will give it one more try, as I always give a place two tries. B  ut I don't think I will be recommending this restaurant."
235,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Like its sister restaurant in San Diego, the food at this location doesn't disappoint. I shared a plate of the fried chicken and waffles with my boyfriend during a trip. Just like home. Yum! I liked the fried scallions that came with the dish. I really enjoyed the play of sweet versus savory on the plate. May I suggest dipping your fried chicken in some maple syrup? We watched a neighboring table where each guy ordered a plate for himself. Needless to say, they all left with doggie bags since the portions are so huge. 

There were a few dings and that's why I rated this 4/5 stars. The restaurant was difficult to find and the hotel was undergoing some construction at the time. The service could have been better. The server did not check in with us to see how we were doing and was a little clueless as to the tip we left her. We chose this place to dine since we had a gift card to use. It was not valid at this location since it was purchased at the San Diego location who has separate ownership."
236,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always amazing, and worth the wait.  Manageable portions on ""hashes"" and ""scrambles"" I order the tractor driver with HH blueberry pancake for $14.99 which is a massive pancake always perfectly cooked with 2 eggs and 2 sausage or bacon.  My wife can get the side of biscuits and gravy for $4.99 and we can share together.  Even at this, it is hard for us 2 to finish.

Food is always amazing and everyone knows it.  That's why there is always such a wait so please be patient and don't take it out on the wonderful servers trying to do their best.

If you love your morning coffee with ""sweet and low"" they do not carry, so bring your own.

Have a VIP card for ceasar's total rewards?   Then this is the best option on the strip for breakfast, right next to ""the henry"" at cosmopolitan"
237,Hash House A Go Go,5,Went for the first time with my boyfriend on a Sunday. It was busy but our server was amazing and the food was delicious! The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. The prices were good and the coffee was strong. Definitely going back!
238,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Good food ,fast service and no wait time to be seated . I love this place. They have large portions I've yet to be disappointed."
239,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We only had a 10 minute wait.  From all the reviews I was worried,  so glad it was quick.  The portions are ridiculous.... In a good way.  Huge,  way too much for most but I loved it.  I got the corned beef hash since it's a ""Hash House""  bomb! My wife got the chicken and waffles, huge huge portion and tasted great! I will definitely come back. Thanks!"
240,Hash House A Go Go,2,ordered the steak and eggs and was completely underwhelmed might as well be eating at Denny's. The steak couldn't be any more than choice and everything else was pretty much Bland and flavorless. For the price of $19 you can do so much better
241,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A bit of a wait to be seated at 8:30 am on a Saturday.  I had the chicken and waffles. The waffles are light but have bacon cooked right into them.  The breading on the chicken was delicious.  The syrup was good.  The entree comes in a tower though.  Way more food than I could handle by myself for breakfast.  To drink, I had a mimosa with pineapple juice but it was just ok.  
The food was good, don't get me wrong, but the portions are HUGE.  If you aren't absolutely starving, split your meal. I am looking forward to eating my leftovers though."
242,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Very average breakfast place to me that's hyped up for no reason. I've also had their dinner and wasn't too pleased with that either. This place is not cheap, but the portions are huge...almost too huge. The service was fine...I was just disappointed in this place because I was expecting a little more. All in all...its just a run of the mill kind of place!"
243,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Farm food makes me think ""fresh, hearty, huge portions,"" and that's what I got here. We went here at night and came back a few days later for breakfast and were not disappointed! The food is amazing, and the portions are large! I'd recommend sharing a breakfast platter with a friend, or take it as a challenge and finish it all by yourself! I'd love to go back if I'm in Vegas again! Happy eating!"
244,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go is one of those places you feel you need to visit because of the hype. This location is inside the Quad Resort and Casino. We visited in the late afternoon mid-week, so the place was pretty empty. I'm so glad we didn't need to wait, because I would have been deeply disappointed. 

The wait staff were nice and attentive, which makes sense since the place was a ghost town. Me and my dining companion split the warm spinach salad (hold the cheese) and Andy's sage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower. I really enjoyed the spinach salad and I was happy we ordered this to balance the meal since the other dish was so sweet. They could have been more generous with the portion of salad for the price. It was also over dressed. Next time I would order the dressing on the side.

The chicken and waffle dish is probably what a good majority of the people come to try. No one loves bacon more than Belle, but I felt the bacon got lost in the waffle. There was a generous portion of fried chicken piled on top of the four waffle pieces. I liked the chicken. I felt there was a good fry to it. Of course, boneless chicken was a plus too because it meant I didn't need to go all ghetto trying to tear into the chicken. What killed the dish for me was all the syrup. I'm generally not a fan of syrup and this dish had far too much on it. The waffles seemed to have syrup not only drizzled over it, but infused inside the waffle. It was just all way too sweet. I felt that even if I ordered the syrup on the side it would have been way to sweet for me. The portion on this item was so large, it is definitely a dish to share. Even with the big eater I was with, we had left overs."
245,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Massive portions! Even their beer bottles are oversized! Excellent food, but you've got to try the cappuccino or hot chocolate!"
246,Hash House A Go Go,1,"First experience here was great: good food, prompt service. Time of day was 7pm, so not busy at all. 

Second experience here: didn't even get a chance to get seated. We were a party of 4 and were told it would take 10 minutes to get a table, which was fine. We waited, and waited, a party of 6 later shows up, they wait 5 minutes and are subsequently seated. We continue to wait, 25 minutes have transpired, we approach the host and ask ""what happened?"" He tells us they are still working on a table for us, we then remind them that we noticed they sat a party of 6 not too long ago who arrived well after us. They scramble to clean a table and say our table is now ready. We say ""No thank you."" Clear discrimination. 

Hash house a no no!"
247,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Not a single meal worth 60 minutes waiting. Go to Yardbird at the Venetian, better food, better and faster service.  Avoid yourself a headache in this place!!!!"
248,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went here for breakfast with a friend. This place gets really crowded; expect to wait for a while to get seated (think 20-40 minutes). But we figured we would stick it out.

I got the lox scramble and a tangerine juice, my friend got the hash with roasted chicken and an Arnold Palmer. It was ok. I tried her chicken and it was good, but not amazing. My lox scramble was good, but I had to dig for the lox, which was frustrating. And without the lox, it really didn't have much flavor. I wasn't impressed with her Arnold Palmer. My tangerine juice was quite good - probably the best part of the meal.

The service was good - waiter was attentive and courteous.

Would I come back again? Maybe. I wouldn't necessarily steer you away without having tried more of their food, but keep your expectations reasonable."
249,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Incredible. Best place for breakfast in Vegas- if you can handle the portions. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken was amazing. And the service is spectacular, even at the bar."
250,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Had breakfast here. Seated right away and well attended to. Didn't care for the food though. Their corned beef hash should be call pulled corned beef with melted cheese. Maybe people like s big pile of shredded meat with melted cheese but to me that's not corned beef hash. Eggs were supposed to be over medium but yolks were hard. ""Home made"" strawberry jam that our server made a big deal over was unimpressive. We won't return."
251,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Anything that opens 24/7 in Vegas is already a plus for me. Who knows when you're gonna be starving after the club or after a long night of drinking?!

Anyways, we came here around noon time and there was a 5 minutes wait. Not too bad. Our server was very attentive and explained the menu to us. We ordered the Andy sage fried chicken Benedict to share. That thing was HUGE! It was quite tasty but maybe a little too heavy for me. I would love to come back here and try other things they have on the menu."
252,Hash House A Go Go,5,"AMAZING. I got the sage chicken it came with mash eggs and biscuit with gravy. My boyfriend got the pancakes with eggs and bacon. Everything was delicious!! Big portions and great drinks. I had asked for an espresso martini and they said he hadn't made one in a while so I ordered a White Russian. She came back with an espresso martini, a little different than I'm used to but pretty good! I got the White Russian after and it was great. They're not cheap with the liquor which is nice, you get what you pay for for sure! Our waitress was awesome very knowledgeable, helpful and patient with us. Highly recommend!"
253,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Visited May 21, 2011. Wait time was forever, but I expect that from any restaurant in Vegas. However, this place was ridiculous. There was a wait to be seated, a wait to order, a wait to get drinks, a wait  to get our food, a wait to get refills, a wait to get a check...I think our group of 12 spent almost 3 hours there! I mean, the servers seemed cool or sarcastically nice, but I couldn't really tell because the wait time made us so hungry we couldn't think straight. I would recommend some bread at least for such a wait time because hungry customers do not make for nice, patient ones. Buuuuuuttttt when your order comes and its made right, the wait time seems wellllll worth it! We enjoyed every bite of our food :) including those I shared it with. Can't wait to try the one in Cali ;)"
254,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I don't know what the hype is for this place.  Waited 30 mins to get seated,  food was mediocre, service was nonexistent. Once the order was placed it took 20 mins for the food to come, waiter was absent the entire time, never came to check on us or ask about the food.  I have had better pancakes, frozen blueberries, and potatoes were too salty.  There is nothing special about the food or the ambiance. Gave 2 stars because the host was friendly and polite."
255,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Every aspect of my experience at the Hash a go go was disappointing. My girlfriend had the mushroom hash which was bland and cold. Potatoes were soggy and unseasoned. I ordered the sage chicken eggs Benedict and the chicken was dry and tough, while the potatoes, eggs and bacon all were cold.  When we were seated, our server spouted a memorized spiel saying "" all of our food is never microwaved or reheated but made fresh.""  They should add "" was probably made two hours before and is sitting under a sun lamp and never seasoned."""
256,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always a must when I visit Vegas. You really cannot go wrong with anything you order here. And the portions! You get so much food, for a great price. Definitely try if you haven't."
257,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was awesome! Decor is super fun , drinks are fun, not to expensive but everything is super good , would love to come back on my next trip to Vegas , I highly recommend. The workers were all very nice! So I definitely would recommend for anyone who loves good food and friendly customer service to go"
258,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hands down the best breakfast food you can get in Vegas for the price it's at. They honestly could charge much more and I wouldn't complain. Portions sizes are HUGE and the food is really delicious. I ordered the corned beef hash with a pancake on the side. When the waitress told me the pancake had a 13 inch diameter I didn't take her seriously. Then she brought out my pancake that was the size of a steering wheel. I loved both dishes but needless to say I had enough pancake leftovers for a completely new meal. Only con is it was PACKED & seems to always be, expect an hour long wait MINIMUM."
259,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Lets get one thing straight, the food here is LEGIT. I am a breakfast connoisseur of sorts and this place is without a doubt top 5 places I've ever been these portions are crazy huge. 

The service we had here was deplorable. Just plain bad. It took 45 minutes to get sat, which i don't really care about, it was noon in Vegas, so i kinda get it. But the attitude we go when we asked how long it would be initially is what I was not ok with. These hostess seemed to be upset that we were even there. Sorry for wanting bacon waffles i guess? 
Also after we were finally sat It took 45 minutes to get bloody Mary's. I was starting to worry if they were fresh growing tomato's. it took that long, like C'mon man. 

We will be back again for the food, without a doubt."
260,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Expected to wait a long time (we had 7 adults, 2 kids and 2 infants)
They mixed up some food orders and we got our food after a couple of tables that came after ours.
They ran out of the fried leeks for the chicken and waffles but didn't tell us until after we asked about them and had finished our meal.  We didn't know until my friend in our party pointed it out.

Anyways I thought the food was pretty tasty.  It was just the service that  we weren't crazy about.  Without the service I would have rated it 3 or 4 stars.

Anyways I emailed the owner and they were friendly and apologetic.  We are going to try again (maybe at the Sahara location).

I will update the next time I try this place."
261,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We really liked this place but had no idea how big the portions were! 

I ordered the sage fried chicken sandwich for my side I chose cheddar bacon mashed potatoes. Super good but I could only eat half of what I ordered. 

Its a really cool restaurant to take people who are visiting from out of town and look at their faces as the food arrives!"
262,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've been here three times now with nary a disappointment. Yes, there's a huge crowd and a long wait, but it's worth it. By far our favorite breakfast spot while in Vegas. They temper the wait with serving the very best bloody Mary's in the world in the waiting area. Pickled green bean in my drank? Yes please!

Portions are enormous and perfect for taking half back to the hotel to eat later. Share a plate? Pffft, I think not. 

I've tried the salmon benedict and the salmon hash, and I think the hashes win over other stuff. I love their biscuits and the sage poking out of them is cute, but it makes the biscuit taste like sage so if you're not a huge fan you might want to ask for no sage in your biscuit. The homemade peach jam on the table is not as good as it sounds, and if you've ever had peach baby food, well then, there ya go. The biscuit is  more than fine without it, though.

Super delicious and worth navigating the Imperial Palace construction and the long wait."
263,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We ate dinner there. The portions are huge, at lest twice the size of regular portion. We wish somebody had informed us of that, we would have order half of the food. Chicken pot pie was very good. Burgers, kids and adults were OK testing but the quality, we thought, was lucking. We ended up with bunch of burger leftovers that nobody wanted to eat next day. If you want to eat on budget and don't care much about the quality of food you just have to share the portions and you get a good bank for your buck."
264,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best breakfast I have ever had in my life. Double stamp no quitzies. Had meatloaf and eggs. My dad had the country chicken. Amazing. Worth the wait.
265,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Very large portions, tasty food if you are into alot of carbs. There is usually a wait here. The staff was nice and efficient. Yet, if you are looking for a quiet atmosphere. Then this is not it. It would be a possible repeat if it weren't for the noise. There is really loud rock music blasting the entire time you are eating. So if that is your thing then you will love it. I saw a couple other items that I wanted to come back to try but doubt it will happen. The blasting obnoxious music was just not appealing for me at all. I couldn't wait to get out of that noise."
266,Hash House A Go Go,5,Think I might of found another favorite restaurant. This place is amazing open 24hrs and with the portions they give you might need every bit of 24hrs to finish your food. Everything is made fresh from scratch! With the amount of food compared to the price not sure how the stay in business giving away so much food for so little. This place is definitely unique I love the unique twist they put on all their dishes and cannot wait to try everything on the menu
267,Hash House A Go Go,5,"As a former Vegas local, this was one of the only places that would get me to the Strip. The breakfast food is amazing! I've never gone for lunch or dinner, but assume it would be just as good. I tell everyone I know to go here when they're in Vegas and no one has ever had anything but great reviews."
268,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is my second time visiting Hash Hash A Go Go. The food is excellent. Very flavorful and well worth the wait. I had a Bloody Mary (YUM!) while we waited for our table. Once we were seated, my husband and I decided to split the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The portions are huge, so splitting a dish makes sense. Prices are reasonable and overall, the staff was friendly. We will definitely keep coming back."
269,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is off the chart, I am always in awe when I see the food come out! The hash was amazing and the service is A1!"
270,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing food and amazing service. Whenever we visit Vegas we always come here to eat because they have fantastic food. We always get the chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict. They also have a amazing watermelon lemonade. Come hungry because these are some big plates of food big enough for 2.
271,Hash House A Go Go,5,Huge portions! Delicious chicken and waffles. The portions here are good enough to feed 2 people. Might as well do any food challenges at this place.
272,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food, great service.  You better come hungry- the portions are gigantic.  We had the French toast, the corn beef hash, and the Man Vs Food favorite Chicken Benedict.  Everything was good and I would recommend."
273,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Portions are huge and definitely shareable. Service was good...a little slow but the place was hopin'. Everything was delicious. Our family of 5 ordered 4 meals and ate them family style (a bit of everything) and we still had a lot leftover. Atmosphere was busy/quirky diner-esque. Perfect for families...big booths, kinda noisy. We really enjoyed it and will definitely be back. PSA: NO BATHROOMS. Do your business before heading to the restaurant or you'll have to head downstairs to the casino bathrooms and that is a ways."
274,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House is like Man vs Food. It's probably the cheapest brunch you'll get on the strip with the amount of food you get. It's towers and towers of food that also tastes very good too! 

I highly recommend the flap jack with granola and blackberries. The granola adds an extra crunch and texture to the huge pancake that's already crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. 

The chicken & waffles are a popular one. The waffles are firm and good with the maple syrup. The chicken skin is thick and crunchy. The chicken isn't the most moist but still very good. 

The hash with mushrooms, artichokes, and spinach is so flavorful. We got the eggs scrambled to share and opt for gravy to compliment the huge biscuit. 

The food isn't just ok, it's actually really good and for that price and size, this place is deserving of 5 stars! Be prepare to wait about 30 mins to 1.5 hours on a weekend. It's totally worth it!"
275,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Disappointing. That's the word to sum up my experience at breakfast this morning. After we were seated, we waited 30 minutes for our food. During our wait, our coffee was refilled one time. When our food finally came out, my order was wrong. It was interesting to me to see how quickly my correct order came out (5 minutes maybe). For a $14 ""healthy start"" option, I would expect more food. Hardly any egg whites, which left a greasy residue on the plate so they couldn't have been all that healthy anyways."
276,Hash House A Go Go,5,One of our favorite restaurants to go to when in Vegas. Seen it on man vs food we also have been to their original vegas location on Sahara. The portions are HUGE. We got the sage fried chicken eggs benedict it's enough to share with someone and still leave the place full. Our other visits we got the chicken and waffles. Also the tractor combo. Never disappointed here. I have recommended hashhouse to my friends and they have loved it. Be prepared for a wait because they are always busy.
277,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I came here with my family to try out the most known for chicken and waffles.  The waiter said that most people are surprised by the portion of the food and they are right.  I was surprised how large the portions are.  I would say to come with a large group because 1 plate can definitely feed more than just 1 person.  We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken, Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Onion & Swiss, and the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles.

I gave this place a 4 star because the food here is very delicious.  The portions are definitely worth the price.  The chicken and waffles were very delicious.  I also liked the scrambled eggs very much.  I say this is definitely a good place to try if you are a fan of chicken and waffles.  I unfortunately thought that some parts of the chicken were definitely drier or more overcooked than other parts."
278,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yes! Service is great and portions are ridiculous! I ate my leftovers for breakfast over two days! My kiddos had pancakes larger than their bodies and the S'Mores mocha- na na na na!  Here's the real deal though- my kiddo got sick from wolfing down his food too fast. My husband managed to get him into the lobby (Linq) but they were both covered. Not to ruin the appetite you are working up- but after this happened the restaurant was phenomenal in their response. I was left with a table full of food and two little kids. The server got me the bill without me asking and brought a bunch of boxes and a plastic bag. They checked in on me as I awkwardly packed up breakfast. I really appreciate the attentive response and the care they gave us all. :) 
But the food-- so great! Little kids can share a breakfast pancake. ;)"
279,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We had a decent wait for Sunday brunch--- but it was absolutely worth it!  It was fun to  look at all the celebrity photos and what they ordered in the waiting area in the mean time. 

Once we were seated--- it seemed busy with a lot of hustle and bustle and typical diner booths.   We went with the chicken and waffles based on reviews, and I have to say-- they were the best we've ever ordered!!! Will definitely return here."
280,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Late Post (visitedTuesday 08/11/15). Those waffles are fluffy, soft, tasty, mouth-watering, definitely a must try, even for lunch! The waffles entre however, is not as big as the other plates. My companions' ordered different items, the courses were HUGE, big plates for the price! None of them actually finished their food, which to me, a course that big is a waste of food. That, and the fact that it was really packed, get them a start away from perfection. 

I heard that the other Hash House on Sahara is less packed, but since we were staying at Paris Hotel, The Linq was just a walk away. Good overall."
281,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Heard a lot of good thing about this place from friends and so, when my girlfriend and I went to Vegas, we had to check it out. It was pretty busy but we waited and got a table. We quickly realized that all the portions were HUGE. We got some drinks (which were $$ as much as our meals) and then finally our food came and needless to say, we weren't hungry anymore. This place is fun to bring a group of people and SHARE something. Ye be warned if you order your own entree lol"
282,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place is way over-hyped!
The food was ok, not real flavorful. The service was very slow. Hard to get coffee, then our breakfasts were cold when they arrived at our table. Would not recommend unless you have a lot of time to sit and wait for coffee or your cold breakfast."
283,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love the portions here. So big. Definitely home style southern cooking. One order can feed 3 people. The wait can be a bit long during lunch so try and come here early so you don't have to wait as long. Quality food, big portions, and good service."
284,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you come here, be prepared for a huge meal! All of their portions are gigantic. I ordered the sage chicken and waffles which had great flavor. The plating was very appealing to the eye. However I would recommend sharing this dish. The waffles had bacon pieces sandwiched in between them, and tasted delicious with the juicy chicken. The more I ate, the more I didn't like the dish as much. Mainly because I was probably full from eating a good half of the chicken and waffles. I felt like I was in a restaurant made for giants; everything is ridiculously ginormous!"
285,Hash House A Go Go,5,"On our first morning in Vegas during our most recent trip, I just typed in Best Breakfast in Yelp and this restaurant came up! I was lured by the fact that Adam from Man Vs Food had come here and wanted to try it out! 

The location: Imperial Palace.. My first thought: REALLY?! Uff. But off we went!

Imperial Palace was going through major renovations.. The entire front section was closed off.. We had to park next door at Bill's? I think that's what it was called.. After nearly falling to my death by slipping on wet floors, we located the restaurant which was on the second floor. Once you go up there, it's like you're not even in Imperial Palace anymore! The restaurant decor was really cool and hip (awesome that I just used that word, I know). The wait was about 20 minutes.. I'm not sure if they took reservations but we just walked in. 

I tried the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. OH MY GOODNESS. I was IN LOVE with this dish. When it came out, I swear I thought that I could probably only finish half (the portion was HUGE. It was the size of a small dog). But to my surprise.. I finished 80% of it. Shocking, I know. But you guys, this was so amazing. It was biscuit.. mashed potatoes.. scrambled eggs.. cheese.. fresh spinach.. fried chicken.. chipotle sauce.. OMG the goodness was overwhelming! I could NOT stop EATING and probably gained 3lbs but it was AMAZING! And I can't wait to go back!

ALSO! PS - get the Kiwi Watermelon drink. Super yummy!"
286,Hash House A Go Go,5,Dude... man... wow... this spot is eff'n amazing... best way to start your day in Vegas... fried chicken benny and a blt Bloody Mary.... huge portions bursting with great flavors and it all sits like a brick to get you thru a long Vegas day... I would give it five stars if it wasn't for the daily hour wait.... but then again there's never a wait at a bad restaurant... a deff must stop in Vegas
287,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House a Go Go is a gem in Vegas and a place you have to stop by. It was a bit hard to find inside the LINQ hotel since it's a bit hidden but it was worth the search!

Of course, you have to try the sage fried chicken and waffles ($19.99). That dish is HUGE! About the size of two heads! You get some fluffy waffles with large pieces of their chicken stacked on top and skewered with a knife. This one dish filled all three of us up and we were super full by the end. 

The chicken is really juicy and the sage is a really nice addition which makes it taste different from just regular fried chicken. They add some fried onions with everything that gives it a nice oniony flavor. The waffles were fluffy and delicious with their maple syrup. Everything paired together was so delicious and comforting. 

Service was great and they let us know that the chicken and waffles would probably be enough for us three so we didn't over order!"
288,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge portions, good service, prices were reasonable, but the food was nothing special. We split the chicken and waffles and it just didn't ""pop"" with flavor.  Kudos to the waiter who talked us into splitting a single meal. There was enough food for both of us, and it saved us $10-$15.  We were at KGB (burger place in Harrah's) last year and enjoyed it much more than HHAGG."
289,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What a dining experience!!!!

We have lived in Vegas 4 months now and this has to be the BEST breakfast place we have tried yet.  I can't wait for family to come visit to take them all here!

We went on a Saturday morning early so we expected a wait.  It was crowded but the wait was only about 20 minutes.  The menu was expansive and included a blend of traditional b-fast and lunch items.  The drink menu is so large it has its own menu! 

We tried the chicken and waffles plate, and a special called ""the Boston hash"".  The plates are massive....big enough to easily feed 3 people!  Everything was excellent including the service.  If you like strong coffee....this is your spot!

I have to say....if you are looking for a b-fast joint....you GOTTA try this place!"
290,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This location is great. I stayed at the LINQ hotel so it was so convenient to eat here. They were just an escalator away.

I ordered some candied bacon and their House Fried Chicken with biscuits. The food was amazing. It really gave you a Southern feel.

The portions were huge so I shared with another friend."
291,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is one of the good eats in Vegas.  The portions are not only enormous, but they either tower over your plate or skillet.  The corn beef hash is a signature dish, but there are plenty of variations of omelets, waffles and flapjacks to choose from.  If you're really hungry, you can even get biscuits with gravy on the side or toast with their homemade apricot jam.  I'll have to come back to try their version of fried chicken and waffles.  

Service is fast, friendly and helpful especially when describing their specials.  The ambiance is casual and one of the hidden gems in the hotel, which is under construction.  Parking is ample in lots nearby."
292,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food = not very awesome, Drinks = very awesome! This was our first stop in Vegas, as I've wanted to try it on many trips and just kept putting it off. The place was dead, barely anyone in it. I got the sparkling white wine spritzer or whatever it was....it was AH MAZEBALLS. Really really good, I could drink that all day. It was light, sweet, and refreshing. The husband and I shared the chicken and waffles, and, honestly, they were just ok. They were large. The bacon in the waffle wasn't that good, a little chewy (I know, sacrilege, but true), and the chicken was a little dry.... the syrup was congealed....just not my fave food in the world. I would return for more wine spritzer...yum....but I'd pass on the food."
293,Hash House A Go Go,4,Waited 40 minutes for a seat and 45 minutes to get food on a Friday @ 10am. Food was delicious though. Would go again just for the chicken and waffles. This place could use a few more waiters as well.
294,Hash House A Go Go,5,"They aim to wow and they do. Went there with the family for breakfast, and it couldn't be bettered. Not your usual diner fare, although you could have that if you want. Huge portions so go hungry or share. Before checkout times the wait is only a few minutes. As we were leaving, after checkout times, wait time was an hour. Be warned!"
295,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Literally damn near everything about this place is perfect. The hostess up front was a little clueless and took like ten minutes to seat us, but everything else was flawless. 

Our server, I think his name was Mike or John (Hispanic looking dude with a mustache), was awesome. Gave really good recommendations and was great about answering our questions. 

You really need to understand one thing about HHAGG, the portion sizes are GARGANTUAN. I don't care how hungry you are, I can throw some food down and I barely finished half of my Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. When I say massive, it's an understatement. The pancakes are literally the size of a hubcap, no exaggeration. Seriously consider splitting an entree with someone else. You will not finish your food. 

The flavors are all amazing. The chicken in all the dishes has a crisp near perfection and a tenderness that is hard to find. And I highly recommend the snickers pancake, it literally has chunks of snickers cooked right into the pancake. 

100% you need to come here. 

Here's my overall ratings-
Atmosphere- 4/5
Food- 5/5
Service- 4.5/5
Quality/value- 4.5/5"
296,Hash House A Go Go,3,"You will literally drop your jaws when the food comes!  One entree is big enough to feed 2-3 people.  This however was not informed by our waitress. For one thing, we wasted a lot of food because the portions were huge.  Second, we did not have a fridge in our hotel room so to go was not a option.  Third, you should definitely share with a friend.  

The menu is pretty good; ranging from various breakfast options to brunch dishes. The chicken and waffles looks delicious! I had the rosemary chicken which was alright.  Lacked a bit of flavor.  The pork cutlet & chicken pot pie all looked good too.

Service is a hit or miss depending on how attentive your server was.  unfortunately we did not get the best service.  I would love to come here again to try new dishes when I am in town!"
297,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is a must go go if you're in Vegas for brunch. The pancakes are HUGE and are thicker than usual pancakes. I also ordered the fried chicken Benedict which was just amazing. The biscuit was perfect and it was served on some delicious mashed potatoes. But more than anything the fried chicken itself was so delicious. You could've eaten just the fried chicken plain and somehow it's flavor was enough. I highly recommend this place. Just beware of long waiting times. We had a 1 hour wait but we spent some time at the boardwalk and came back.
298,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This is based on the food my boyfriend had, he ordered the sausage pot pie with gravy and eggs and took two bites of it and felt sick. A few hours later he was throwing up. I don't know if the food was not cooked right or something but the food really messed him up. And he is still in bed getting sick 2 days later.

The only reason why we would ever come back is for the service our waitress was the sweetest, but other than that I would stay away from here . Plus the wait is super long for a table."
299,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you want BIG food at a local dive this place is the place to be! The portions are huge, a truck drivers dream. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the wife got a salmon omelet. We were shocked when the plates came, wow it could have fed 4 people! Overall the food is good and the price is reasonable. I recommend sharing a plate if your not a big eater."
300,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is sooooo the bomb!  Upon my visit to Vegas yet again I had to have breakfast at Hash House.  My boyfriend had never been to Vegas, so for his first visit to the city, I had to take him to some of my favorite places in the city and Hash House was at the top of the list!  The Imperial palace hotel is under construction, but the restaurant is still open upstairs!

I usually sit at the bar and this time was no exception and I was so happy to see Kai was still working there and waited on us.  She is great and very quick!

The food was delicious and as usually we couldn't finish it all because they give you so much.  The drinks are just to die for and very much worth the money!

I will definitely be back, Hash House you have done it again, thanks for the great service and amazing food!!!!!!!!"
301,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House gets a solid 4 stars from me because my first visit was 5 stars, and my second visit was 3 stars. However, the inconsistency is something to say in itself. 

The first time I visited Hash House was in San Diego where I decided that it was the best breakfast I've ever eaten. I can't remember what I ordered since it was awhile back, but that feeling of satisfaction has never left my mind. 

More recently I went to the Vegas restaurant, eagerly awaiting my breakfast bliss once again as I climbed up the escalator @ Linq. This time, I was much more disappointed. I got the chicken rosemary hash and unfortunately the chicken was dry and bland. The eggs were ordinary. The only thing I loved on my plate was the huge flakey biscuit with a huge stick of rosemary speared through the middle.

Note, they dont take reservations so you just have to wait.. and wait... and wait... Their seating area isn't huge so be mindful of the time if you leave the seating area and hang out in the casino."
302,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This is Hash a No No for me. I had the chicken pot pie and it was overwhelming. It had too much different foods in it and it lacked flavor. The crust was hard except for the bottom because it was soaked from the filling. 

My husband had the mushroom swiss burger and wasn't pleased. It was under done for his preference and lacked flavor.  
They try to get creative with the presentation, but it's just over done. 

 The service was nice,  our waitress was apologetic."
303,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really enjoyed this place. Portions are so big I think my chicken benedict must have weighed over a pound and a half. My girl had this bbblt that must of had half a cow. Usually with food portions so big the food sucks but its not the case here. I used to stay at the imperial palace when i was younger cuz it was cheap so be ready cuz its a dive casino but I still love gambling there. Hey besides you can always get a 100oz 4shot drink right outside at Rockhouse.
Cant wait to bring all my boys here next time out."
304,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are pretty dam big. Food is quite good. Fried chicken was juicy but didn't feel like you were eating grease. Waffles are really good too. And there's bacon in it. What's not to love about that.

Make sure to order yourselves a BLT Mary, Bloody Mary with a twist. That was pretty dam good."
305,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Absolutely delish, it did take a while to pay our bill, only downfall. I had a vegetarian hash which was excellent, extremely large portion."
306,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Let me preface this by saying that I don't usually like chicken.  Yes, yes, I know, who doesn't like chicken?  Well, I don't.  But THIS chicken...the chicken and waffles is just AMAZING.  My boyfriend ordered it and I ended up eating most of his chicken because it was just so damn tasty.  The mix of herbs they put in there really infuse the chicken and make it taste like a bird that's flown in from heaven.  I thought the friend chicken here was inifintely better than Roscoe's (I know, blasphemy to some).  

Also, I usually can't eat more than a bite of pancakes.  But...the brown sugar banana pancake is also REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD here.  The pancake is pizza size, and the entire top is glazed with a crunchy brown sugar coating that pairs great with the pancake beneath.  Yum!

I got some kind of a sausage scramble (can't even remember which one) which was not really very great.   Also, the ""bacon waffles"" do have bacon embedded in them, but they disappointingly do not taste quite as good as they sound in theory."
307,Hash House A Go Go,5,From reading the reviews we decided to go here. The best decision we have made so far. The food and service were excellent.
308,Hash House A Go Go,4,Very big portions and delicious.  You have to try the bloody marry's!
309,Hash House A Go Go,4,"While in Las Vegas my family and I decided to go here for dinner. The food was good and extremely large amounts. My kid ordered a pancakes and it was gigantic. Could have been shared amongst 2 people. Great service, I would recommend this restaurant to others."
310,Hash House A Go Go,3,This place was just ok for me. If you like a lot of food on your plate then this is your place. I certainly wouldn't wait to eat here.
311,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food for breakfast was just ok. But it was an experience worth having. Never been to one before and we don't have one in philly. I recommend for the experience but I would say the best breakfast place is at bouchon at Venetian.
312,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You must visit here at least once if visiting Vegas. I strongly recommend getting the fried chicken Benedict. Be prepared to not finish it! I come every time I visit Vegas. Glad they are finally remodeling the location, was starting to smell like a Denny's."
313,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place was not bad. The lower rating is mostly due to the wait and location. We went on a Sunday around 1. First of all finding the place is a bit odd. Then once you get there there was about 50+ people waiting in the waiting area. Our wait to get seated was over an hour. Once we finally did sit down our order got taken quickly but we waited another good 30 minutes or more for food. And even saw parties seated after us get food first. I had the fried chicken Benedict and husband had the chicken and waffles. The food was good. Nothing extraordinary, nothing to wait in line for over an hour for but if I was able to get in fairly quickly I would go back. I think the hype is more for the portion size. HUGE! Definitely easily shared between 2-3 people. This place is open 24 hours so definitely could see this as a great after party choice or hungover breakfast spot. Since it was later in the day I didn't see either. The place is loud. Really loud. So if you're looking for a relaxed place to grab some breakfast go elsewhere."
314,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'm never impressed by quantity over quality but I really wanted to like this place. The wait was 90 minutes for breakfast so we went and gambled and returned in 75 minutes $150 richer. Score!  So, we're all riding a jackpot high ready for some good food. I was drawn to the Benedict menu, while my dining partners had sage chicken and corn beef and cocktails. Maybe it was the alcohol -- they loved their food but I was greatly disappointed (drinking coffee).  I had the HH original that was supposed to have tomato cream sauce. I was unpleasantly surprised to receive a plate covered in marinara sauce; eggs, mash, biscuit covered in marinara. The biscuit on it's own-delicious. The mash-yum. The combination?  An utter failure. Where was the cream sauce?  My recommendation, drink heavily or win the price of the meal and you won't care so much."
315,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It was okay I heard so many good reviews and so I wanted to come and see for myself 
I got the snickers flapjack with biscuits and sausage gravy they were okay nothing amazing though I've definitely had better in my hometown so I was not impressed 

Our waiter was great very helpful"
316,Hash House A Go Go,2,"You can be used to queues and waiting in Vegas but this place borders on the abysmal. They don't tell you that there are two queues and grossly underestimate their wait times. We tried twice and were told up to an hour, it took over two. You get frustrated when you realize their 'platinum' members just walk in to the next available table regardless of wait time. 

The service was rushed, and the dining area packed and crowded. 

The portions are what people come here for, and they are definitely huge. In fact I'd wager there isn't a dish on the menu that doesn't exceed the calories a human being needs for a whole day. The pancakes and waffles in particular are massive. Simple comfort food, nothing fancy. 

Probably not worth the hassle of actually getting seated."
317,Hash House A Go Go,4,Go to Las Vegas and enjoy this destination the food is great I can't see enough good things about it it was fabulous and I will come again I think the prices were reasonable seating was nice the wait staff was excellent
318,Hash House A Go Go,5,Definetly a must try!!!!! Their brown sugar banana pancakes were BOMB!!! Good service and good food!
319,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food was delicious. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which was around the 13-20 $ range, I can't remember exactly. Portions were large and came out in a fairly decent amount of time. The only thing that ruined my experience was the rude redheaded host. We asked to be sat in a booth and she refused telling us that she absolutely could not. Now I could understand this if it was packed and busy, but it was 5 AM, and there was plenty of seating, not even half full!  I had to ask to speak to someone else and then we were seated 10 mins later in a booth. What really irritated me even further was that a party of three (same as ours) was seated in the booth in front of us by the redheaded host not even 5 mins later! I'm not sure if she was talked to by her managers. I shouldn't have to argue for a seat in a half empty restaurant.  

I will return again to try some different dishes since the first dish I ordered was delicious. I heard the chicken a waffles are a must here. I hope next time I get a polite host! What good is a restaurant if the food is good and the service is terrible! Especially when it's the host, the first interaction I have when entering."
320,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We ate here our first day in Vegas. We were starving, hungover, and didn't realize the walk was gonna be 15 minutes. We got our hashes and raced back to the hotel, only to realize that my hash was missing the poached eggs.
I called them and the manager, Kay, answered. She immediately sympathized and invited to comp my next hash if we came in the next day. She also offered to get us immediate sitting.
So, I called ahead the next day (per Kay's request), and boom she made all her promises happen!
Had a really good experience, no better way to please a dissatisfied costumer :)
Oh, and the food was amazing as always; we had the salmon hash and the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese scramble."
321,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you are in Vegas, after a long night of partying this is the place to go! The portions are HUGE and completely worth it. If you are a total rewards member you get priority seating, which is AMAZING! I ordered the omelette while my friends got a chicken benedict (I think) and it was honestly it was delicious!"
322,Hash House A Go Go,5,"All I have to say is wow!  
Came here for lunch and had to wait an hour which is worth the wait since their food is huge!

I had the basic for $7.95- sunny side up, mapled bacon, crispy country potato( they were sooo good!!) and rye bread.  BTW- I was full! LOL

Also had the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower
Drizzled with hot maple reduction & fried leeks $18

Be aware: the wait for your food takes awhile!!!"
323,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a GREAT American breakfast/brunch place to go on the strip! The wait is 40mins +, however, if you have a small party, you will wait 20 mins to get in, even though they said the wait is 40mins. The place is huge, so they do call on the numbers often and call on many numbers in a row. There are sitting benches outside that you can wait and you can also order your drink at the bar if you wanted while waiting. Food is HUGE. No matter what you order, portion of the food will be like you are at Texas. Their mimosas are good, favorite is tangerine. Pineapple mimosas was ok. It's always going to be crowded but their service have been quick. I would definitely recommend this place."
324,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So. Much. Food. 
Plan to wait, but I promise, it's a wait worth sitting on the benches for!! I had the Pork Tenderloin Eggs Benedict & my dining ""guest"" had the Sage Chicken Eggs Benedict. Had I known the portions were gigantic, we would have shared. And since we are not taking any ""doggy bags"" back to our hotel room, my suggestion is to SHARE!!! (That is, of course, if you are good size human being with a hefty appetite that can handle these portions.) I also had a Butterscotch Latte which was pretty darn delicious and even included a token butterscotch candy on the side. 
The best part of our visit was our awesome, sweet, sassy, and fun waitress Rebecca. LOVE HER!! It's amazing when good service will make your entire visit that much more pleasant and fun. She made terrific, on-point, and honest suggestions so I hope you are as lucky to get her as we were. 
Located right smack dab in the middle of the Imperial Palace Hotel (currently very ugly due to the construction stuff), ride the escalator up one floor and you should find a mass of people waiting in line in front of you!"
325,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions! My boyfriend and I have big appetites, but this definitely defeated us. Food was pretty good- loved the red velvet pancakes."
326,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love their service and my favorite is the chicken and waffle.  Big portion, it can fill up two grown adults."
327,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place does it BIG! The portions are ridiculously awesome and for how much food you get the prices are amazing! You can easily share between two to three people! The menu is fun and our server was hilarious. He knew the menu inside and out and was very personable. The atmosphere was busy and a bit loud but over all it was enjoyable experience. They have fun items like their ""o'hare of the dog"" which is 25oz Budweiser (paper bag included) and 5 pieces of bacon for like $10- can't beat that!

We had;
Andys saged fried chicken Benedict; it was HUGE and filling. Flavors were decent although it was a bit spicy- I can't handle much heat

HH- big quesadilla - again a bit spicy

Overall an excellent place for a hearty breakfast for a decent price."
328,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is almost overwhelming! So many choices and the portions are HUGE!!! We went for breakfast and I had the mango coconut pancakes. It was one enormous pancake with coconut and mango throughout and a crunchy coconut crust from being cooked on the griddle - amazing. The only downside was that for a pancake the size of a Thanksgiving turkey platter, they gave you a tiny creamer pitcher of syrup. Definitely had to ask for more.

The wait for a table wasn't bad about 20-30 minutes, but we had to wait forever for our food. We saw many tables that were seated after us get served their food first. It was quite annoying. However, it was still worth the wait."
329,Hash House A Go Go,5,One of my favorite places to eat whenever I'm in Vegas. I prefer this location over the one on Fremont Street which didn't have as good of food.
330,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Waitress was really nice and food is always amazing!! I'm giving 2 stars for the hostess's and their careless, bully type mentality. There were 3 hostess. Two female one male. We walked in, stepped up the counter and stood there for 5 minutes to wait for them to finish their conversation before we were even greeted or even looked at. I gave them my name - they told me 10 minutes. We sat in the seating area just behind the hostess stand and what I overheard, baffled me.. I sat there shocked and in disbelief.. the 3 hostess were talking about and making fun of a group of people waiting for their table. Calling them names and saying stuff about ""how ugly"" his face was.. calling people fat and using profanity. They called a family of 4 to be seated and asked them to step forward on the carpet.. the host then went back to chat with other hosts for 5 minutes before even bringing that poor family to their table. Getting frustrated with watching/listening to this and realizing that I had been listening for over 20 minutes and went up and asked how much longer it would be.? Looking at me confused she shuffled through the papers, clearly not seeing my name.. ( I know this because I could see the paper and I was put down as Jamie not Jennifer) she looked up and said ""oh.. I called you 15 minutes ago"". Ahhh no! I sat right behind them, and definitely did not!!  I think it's time to hire mature people to run the front of house.. they're the first faces you see when walking in .. I'm disgusted with the way they were treating people."
331,Hash House A Go Go,5,"while it's rather unfortunate that you have to navigate the appalling cinder-block monstrosity that is The Imperial Palace (aaah! save yourselves!) with its maze of mirrors and clanging slots and bad hair-sprayed up-dos, it is SO worth it just to score the Sage Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict at this glorious eatery! 

plan to share or take home a second meal because as everyone agrees the portions are MASSIVE, and I mean ""models have nightmares about their side-salad"" massive.

you can also drive 15 minutes off the strip to a much lovelier location, had the Benedict at both and found them of an equally delicious nature, and the service and ambiance were excellent in both locations too.

quite honestly, for me, this is the saving grace when I have to visit Vegas for work! I'd say ""don't tell my boss"" except that he agrees! enjoy!"
332,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food and a wide variety. Very busy and loud. Family friendly too!
You have to try this place if you haven't already!"
333,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It's open 24 hours, what a fantastic idea!!! It's always food time!! Had eggs and chicken breast!!! It was delicious. Very busy, very creative dish and the presentation surpasses all my creations. I mean huge beautiful tasting biscuit with thyme stabbed into it!!! So so pretty. The mocha latte was delish with another pretty presentation. Whipped delicious real cream with chocolate dripped on it plus I get to keep the adorbs glass. Too much to handle. Then of course, had to have my watermelon drink...three layers of beauty colors with an ass tasting sweet watermelon slice!! I'm drink heaven!!! My entree had delish mashed potatoes, lean tasting bacon, fresh tomatoes, melon slice, and orange slices! Perfection, but loved the fried chicken best with the maple syrup was yummy."
334,Hash House A Go Go,5,We had the fried chicken Benedict and it was incredible! Definitely big enough for two! Also loved the fresh squeezed tangerine juice.
335,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is GREAT and definitely worth the wait!  Just not sure why they put this restaurant in the nasty Imperial Palace!  But it is great...don't miss it!
336,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions and always busy. But food is really good! Get there early or be prepared to wait! Also reasonably priced.
337,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. My husband and I have been here maybe 12-15 times. And it's just amazing each time. To start off, order one of their amazing drinks. I love the hot chocolate and the s'mores mocha. All of their drinks are special in their own way. 

They're always very busy, but they handle it well. Their servers are prompt and the kitchen is speedy. I mostly get the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. This is a huge piece of fried chicken on top of home made mashed potatoes, a large side of scrambled eggs, bacon, a biscuit, and fruit! I would recommend ordering a side of gravy to go with the biscuit. 

Tip: if you're Diamond level Total Rewards member, you can skip the line."
338,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you are really really hungry I would suggest eating here. They have lots to choose from and their serving portions are HUUGE! Which is not that bad for their menu pricing. 

The only thing is that they are always crowded especially in the morning on the weekends. I've only eaten here twice and had to wait a while to be seated each time. So expect a line if you don't get there before they open. The unfortunate thing is that you can't make reservations and cell phone reception is terrible so if you're trying to get a hold of people who are meeting with you there do it before entering. 

Other than that their food is good. So far I've tried their mushroom Swiss burger and their banana nut french toast which was delish!"
339,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is such a fun place to have breakfast. The food totally lived up to our expectations. My husband ordered the sage chicken of waffles of course which was so good. I ordered off their special menu for the day which was the crab cake ceasar salad. The portions were huge and the staff was pleasant and prompt. The first time we went, we became instant fans and took our friends out to breakfast here when arrived into Vegas a few days later. We were so excited to bring them there but to our dismay, the line was so long and we saw several large parties of 8 get seated before our party of 4 even though they arrived after us. When we finally were seated, we were very honest and told our waiter that we only had 45 minutes left to order and get our food because we had a show to see at the MGM. We took a chance that he respond with an attitude given ours when we were finally seated but he remained so calm and understanding the whole time. It totally made up for the long wait. He took our orders, went straight to the kitchen and came out with our food about 15 minutes later (not bad seeing as how they make everything from scratch!). We made it to our show on time and with full tummies."
340,Hash House A Go Go,5,Rare to find restaurants that serve meatloaf. This place does it to perfection - in an abundance!
341,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place has large portions and is very reasonably priced. It is all down home cooking! My favorite is the biscuits and gravy. However, there is nothing healthy on the menu and if you are diabetic, I would steer clear of this place. All meals are low in veggies and pile on the carbs and fatty protein. But it is delicious!!!"
342,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place if you have a huge appetite! I always share a meal with someone every time I go. Of course the chicken and waffles are delicious! But don't sleep on the burgers. 4 Stars because the service is great and the portions are generous, but the lack of vegan options made it hard for my girlfriend to eat there."
343,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Tried this Hash house a go go and everything sounded so funky, I totally agree with everyone who put 2 stars as well. The portions are big but you can not eat it all. It gets to be too much and it is sickening. Not worth the hype I heard about this place.
I think they took the restaurant over that was there in imperial for years. That was my favorite place and was so disappointed when this place took it over. I would not go back here I was very disappointed."
344,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What an awesome breakfast joint! The portions are massive so share with a friend and you still won't likely finish one plate. The Bloody Mary's aren't great, we took a few sips of each (we ordered 2 different ones) and that was enough. But coming from Wisconsin where bloody's are king, I'd say we have pretty high expectations. But the food is truly great! Will be back!"
345,Hash House A Go Go,2,"A friend had recommended we go here for brunch in Vegas, but we were not a fan. Ridiculously massive portions, expensive, slow service, dirty, ugly environment with fluorescent lighting, and the food just wasn't that good.

First of all, the wait was like 2 hours. We should have gone somewhere else, but since it had been recommended we just bummed around outside and in the casino for a couple of hours. Too bad it wasn't worth the wait. 

The portions here are huge...ginormous...like you could not only share a portion, but could probably share a portion between three people. It's ridiculous. I'd rather just pay less for a regular sized portion, but I guess that's their thing.

I ordered Andy's Fried Chicken which is one of their specialties. The chicken was pretty good, but not amazing. I also ordered their famous bloody mary which was also good but nothing to write home about.

The environment was crowded, no windows, weird lighting, and it was so busy that it seemed like the servers were struggling to keep tables clean so you had old napkins and plates strewn around. 

I'd just go somewhere else for brunch."
346,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had their trademark chicken and waffle dish, which could have fed three people. They nailed it on the sweet & savory combination, and the dish was delicious. I also sampled their manhole sized pancake, which had a crispy sugary top and was even better than the chicken and waffles. 

My only complaint is that the wait is always long, and it was chaotic, loud, and smokey in the restaurant."
347,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Awesome food, Great price, Good service.

Then why the 1 star review? The attitude of the manager. 

We, party of 4, got there at 9:55, seated at 10:05 (which we thought was amazing), and got served almost cold food at 10:55. Really?

We started noticing the time after seeing a few tables that were seated after us, got their food first.
When we finally got ours, the potato fries were luke warm, the eggs were wrongly cooked and the ham was card board like.
We told the waiter, John, and he attempted to fix the wrong. We can live with that.

But then we asked for the manager and he came in with the ""Yeah, so what, I don't give a sh*t"" attitude. He was non apologetic and cold shouldered. Most definitely not a good trait for a manager.

When you're out if town, and you just want a good meal and was not served one, a manager should at least smile when he's acknowledging a bad service/food.

Most disappointing, most definitely will not set another foot in this place."
348,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Brunch to the MAX ... don't miss this place if you are coming to Vegas. We had a wonderful brunch here in July 2014. Everything was fresh from the kitchen and our server Brie was fantastic. She definitely went above and beyond and kept the peach jam flowing at our table. Our party of 5 enjoyed a House Hash - tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit, Farm Scrambles and crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich with chili mayo, red leaf & tomato on a wheat bun. Food was amazing and the service second to none. Even though there was a wait it was totally worth it. Funny - we ate at another very well known restaurant for breakfast and the prices were the same but this food was over the top."
349,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Chicken and waffles, you are my jam!  I was so excited to try this place out after seeing it on tv. It's inside the Quad (formerly the Imperial Palace).  Go all the way to the back, away from the strip entrance.  There is a escalator with signage.  
No wait at 8 am on Wednesday.  Plenty is seating booths and tables.   They are open 24/7 with a full service bar. The portions are ridiculous.  Definitely enough for two meals.  

It was so good.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The waffles had a hint of vanilla with bacon cooked right in.  Is it better than Roscoe's in L.A.? No.  But, it is legit. My only criticizim is not enough syrup.  Definitely ask for extra right off the bat.
  
Our server was great and attentive.  He even offered to give us to go cups for our coffee. I look forward to coming back next trip.  

P. S.  I brought the leftovers with me on the plane.  Too good to waste."
350,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had to go back to this place while in Vegas, absolutely loved the food. You won't be disappointed with the fried chicken, the biscuits, etc. Portions are TOO big, which is not a bad thing if you can take it to go and have a fridge. Tip: order 1 plate and share. The second time we did that and it was just perfect."
351,Hash House A Go Go,5,"There's a reason this brunch restaurant has amazing reviews - Hash House A GoGo does not disappoint. My boyfriend and I got to the restaurant around 10:30a on Friday and there was already a long wait (they told us ~30-45 min). The wait actually ended up being closer to over an hour, at which point, we decided to grab two recently emptied up seats at the bar. Best decision ever!!!

Once we were seated, we ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken dish, (the M v. F special), the Banana & Brown Sugar Pancake and the house side salad. For drinks, we got the vodka soda with a splash of orange juice (so yummy). All of the dishes were sooooo good. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy, the creamy sauce on top was savory and flavorful and the biscuit was bomb.com. The pancake was also delicious! Lastly, the dressing that came with the side salad was also superb (cucumber ranch)."
352,Hash House A Go Go,3,"When I came to Vegas a few weeks ago, I was extra excited to come to Hash House. I've already tried it once before but what I had (to me) tasted really disgusting. It just seemed like a bunch of things mashed together and shoved into a togo box. 

This time around, I had the chicken and waffles and it was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend and I ordered our own separate portions but thankfully (and ironically=P), the waiter forgot one of our orders so we only had 1 order of the chicken and waffles and skipped out on the omelette plate. The portion was perfect and our chicken was cooked to perfection!

Why only 3 stars?
1.) Right when we started eating, a drunk lady made her way outside and threw up in her hand and then on the floor. Yes, I know this isn't Hash Houses fault but it still was disgusting.
2.) The restaurant itself is ugly and dirty looking.
3.) Their TV's are so small and old school.
4.) There are a bunch of tables but they wouldn't let our party of 8 sit at our preferred tables because ""no one is assigned to that area"". All 8 of us were then sat at 2 small circular tables that were pushed together- and yes, it was VERY crowded.
5.) The food took forever to make. The glass of water I had had a fruit fly in it. Gross.

Would I come back? Probably only for togo."
353,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This location is at the LINQ Hotel, so if you're looking for some large portioned breakfast, this place is definitely the spot to hit up. I tried the spicy chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries for myself while my nephew, and my niece and spouse shared the Chicken and Waffles. Food quality is pretty decent but the portions are huge, trust me.. 

Hash House is known for large portions and all 4 of us were able to share only two meals and have PLENTY. Wow!"
354,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Loooove this place!  There isn't one in LA, so every time I see one I try to go.  

Food: Amazing!  But HUGE portions.  I usually split something because the portions are ridiculous.  It is a little pricier, but for the amount of food its a very reasonable price.  Also, everything is cooked fresh.

Service:  Always friendly, but it takes so long - again because its cooked fresh.  The wait was about 1.5 hours to get in, then it takes 35-40 minutes to get your food.  

Wifi: free! - hashhouse - It's great because the service at the casino is terrible

Will definitely come here (or at least any of the Hash House locations) every time I visit Vegas!"
355,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Summary review: This place is worth a visit if you are hung over, really hungry, and looking for a square meal (a huge one) in Vegas that tastes decent and doesn't cost a ton of money.

ENORMOUS portions. Definitely recommend splitting with someone or being ready to pack about half of it and take it home. Definitely make sure you go hungry. There are reasonable prices given the quantity of food. I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which was $15.95 and easily enough to feed two; this was one of the most expensive items on the breakfast menu. There were plenty of menu selections for the $9-15 range.

The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is apparently their signature dish (with Man vs. Food notoriety). I was really impressed with the way it was assembled and presented. However, every bite ended up being a gigantic mess of hollandaise sauce (which they refer to as ""chipotle cream""; did not taste anything like chipotles and tasted everything like standard hollandaise), potatoes, biscuit, and chicken. Had they made the dish slightly smaller and more manageable, it would have been a much higher-quality entree.

In addition, call me a purist, but it is a travesty to call any dish without poached eggs a ""Benedict"". The thin tasteless layer of scrambled eggs on top seemed more like an afterthought to the dish rather than a main component. Why not call it a ""fried chicken scramble"" that happens to include hollandaise sauce?

Other complaints: Drinks were really cool-looking but not very alcoholic. Wi-Fi didn't work and zero cell reception in the building.

Overall, the place wasn't bad, but unremarkable. It works in Vegas, but that's about it."
356,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My wife and I grabbed a late night meal after a show at the LINQ.  The service was fast & friendly. The food looked & tasted great.  The portions are huge enough to share, but you really want to try everything on the menu.  I got the fried chicken and waffles (they are no ordinary waffle either) and my wife got the chicken pot pie.  A great find!"
357,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Been a fan of this chain since discovered it downtown a couple years ago (at Plaza).   Food is excellent. Yes, it's more than you can (& probably should) consume at one meal.  But, the dishes are creative and well prepared.  No pre-made food just assembled.  Each is made from scratch.  I had the Andy sage fried chicken Benedict and it was excellent.  All of the components went well together.  Perhaps could use less mashed potatoes and a bit more gravy but that's pretty minor.  Wait time is crazy.  Come early or late or come prepared to wait.  Environment seemed a bit cramped-low ceiling and tables close.  Especially compared to Plaza location- that one has a better atmosphere.  Server was great.  Friendly and kept coffee filled. Probably next time I come back to Vegas I'll go back to the downtown location primarily because of the atmosphere.  Food is the same as is the service."
358,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Have eaten here before, this trip the food was cold and the service was horrible. Could not even get a cup refilled while we were there. Skip this place now"
359,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I came here one time a few years ago in 2015. I wasn't a yelper back then so I thought I'd write something now. I remember the service was very friendly. This place is great if you are hungover or just hungry. The portions here are huuuuge! Prices are not that bad either. You definitely get a bang for your buck. 
I ordered a hash and it came out in a cast iron skillet. It took me a while but I was able to finish it. I think half the of the plate was potatoes. A little too much potato. Also, the food could have been seasoned better. It was a little bland. I added salt and pepper and it was better. I was so full that I didn't need to eat the rest of the day. For dinner, I had a light snack at burger king and I was good!"
360,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best scramble I've ever had (and I've had a lot of scrambles in my life). My husband and I ordered the same thing - the scramble with bacon, avocado, and Swiss cheese. 

The biscuits are massive and the homemade jam was outstanding. The fresh fruit had an excellent presentation and the fruit was high-quality. This was the biggest portion of breakfast food we could find in Vegas. You will not leave hungry. I highly recommend this place in the LINQ. I almost forgot, the mimosas are to die for. Cheers!"
361,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This place has beautiful presentation. But no worth your time or money. 5 stars for the photo worthy food. 1 stars for service. 1 star for flavor., I understand a wait for tables. But a 15 min wait to get a drink order isn't great, I ordered my meal with no mushrooms... So the food came, and mine was covered in mushrooms, waited another 10 minutes to send it back. waitress said the kitchen messed up (I hate when people blame others) 15 minutes more my food showed back up. We got the chicken and waffles and a veggie hash platter. No flavor, zero seasoning on the chicken, waffles are like biscuits. Very little syrup. So dissatisfying. We received the check and it clearly showed she keyed in my order wrong. So she lied and blamed others..."
362,Hash House A Go Go,5,"LU IS AWESOME! if you come here ask for her as server 

Made the night laughable and great

And food is amazing"
363,Hash House A Go Go,5,So good this place is amazing...I hate long waits for food but this one was definitely worth the wait...
364,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We ate here on the 23th and our server Jon was great, he gave some great infoe on different things on the menu we wanted to order. My husband had a burger I had the pot pie , now be ready because the portions are beyond huge but my goodness the food was great. The meal started out with home made biscuits with honey butter and these were the size of a soft ball,, great meal come hungry and enjoy every moment."
365,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great breakfast with massive portions. Definitely a must when in Vegas! There are too many good things on the menu to choose from!
366,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Go every year when we hit Vegas.
Great Service, Great Food, More food than a normal person can eat.

Stop reading this and go eat at the Hash House."
367,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Simply the greatest bowl of Steel-cut Oats I've ever had. Don't feel the need to get a side of eggs and toast, Hash House Steel-cut oats will get the job done. Fun servers, but try to get seated before 9, the line gets a little crazy."
368,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We had this place bookmarked as it was on Man vs Food and were so excited we were finally able to check it out.  We came in and had to wait for maybe about 30 minutes as this place was super packed!  No worries, they were serving Bloody Marys and Screwdrivers while you wait!  These drinks are stiff.  We were finally seated and greeted by our waiter.  I of course ordered the Griddled French toast that is dipped in banana cinnamon cream and came with pecan maple syrup.  Oh my, the French toast was fantastic.  Love it and the portion was huge.  My hubby of course ordered the Sage Chicken Benedict and really enjoyed it.  The chipotle cream was really good and flavorful.  Everything here was really good and we both walked out in a food coma.  Perfect time to walk it out on The Strip! LOL"
369,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMGeewhiz!!! This place is freaking fantastic!!! My family and I went on a last minute trip to Vegas and I mean LAST minute, only about 12hrs we decided to book a room and we were on the road.

Anyways, my husband and I were traveling w/ our kids and the 'rents so we played it safe rather than go to Hooters, lol. I whipped out my ever-ready i-phone and brought up my trusty Yelp app and went to work. We were looking for breakfast near our hotel and I saw this place pop up. I sat on my hotel bed wondering where I had heard this restaurants name before...and then it hit me...Man vs. Food!!! So I just had to try it.

We arrived, and I do have to say the location was rather difficult to navigate. It is in the Imperial Palace on the strip. You have to go to the parking garage (if your driving) and then take a set of elevators to get to the main level then you have to walk a little ways and get on yet another elevator to get inside the main area to access the restaurant. The you have to take the escalator or elevator(again) to get to the floor where the restaurant is located...sheesh, we built up an appetite just doing all that walking.

But boy was it worth it!!! Even as busy as they were for a Saturday at brunch (who knew people were awake that early in Vegas, lol) we were seated w/in a few short minutes. Our waiter came by and was super friendly. He asked if we had ever ate there before and when we said no he decided to give us a rundown of the menu w/out boring us and w/out us forgetting the menu items he suggested.

We placed our order and I'd say w/in about 15-20min it was brought out to us. I was in total shock when I saw how HUGE HUGE HUGE the portions were. I couldnt believe it and wanted to double check the menu price cause there was no way we were getting all that food for so cheap, even in Vegas. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken w/ a maple reduction, mashed potato's, tomato slices and a biscuit. The food was soooooo yummy, especially the maple reduction on the fried chicken...who woulda thunk it. My daughter ordered the choc. chip pancake and it was heavenly. I shared a little off of everyone's plate and was not disappointed. I asked for jelly for my biscuit and they brought out a little pot filled w/ muddled strawberry jam, the BEST!!!

Everything about this restaurant is top notch...from the food, the waiters, seating and atmosphere. We will DEF be returning here next time in Vegas. I cant wait to try other items on the menu!!!"

We ended up at this place because we were trying to get to the other location near Main Street, but the GPS took us for a twist.

As soon as we got there, we were hooked.  In the entryway, they had Bloody Mary's that you could purchase and drink while you waited for your table.  The place was packed, but a VERY GOOD bloody mary while you wait makes the line a heck of a lot shorter!

Once we got in, I ordered the Pistachio Mocha and she ordered the Smores Latte--both delicious and exactly what we were looking for.  The mocha was iced and very sweet--just the way I like it.  The flavor was good and the chocolate didn't drown out the pistachio--I don't think I could have asked for anything better!  The latte was hot and slightly less sweet--just the way she likes it.

For the meal we ordered the veggie skillet thing (mushrooms, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, potatoes, spinach).  I can't remember what it was called, but it was by far the healthiest thing on the menu.  The portion size was large and it was great to see them load up the veggies and not just inundate the skillet with potatoes like other places tend to do to cut on costs.

As a second dish, we ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  I have had chicken and waffles, but this was by far the best I have had.  First off, the chicken was deboned--which means you just cut into it and eat--no need to chomp through cartilage or cut around bones to get to the meat.  Second, the batter wasn't too thick or excessive and complemented the chicken perfectly.  Third, the chicken was cooked PERFECTLY--probably brine-soaked before they deep fried it because it was plump, juicy, and pretty much just a perfect piece of chicken.  Lastly, the waffle was cooked well, and right in the middle of each piece of waffle was a few slices of bacon, which was an awesome surprise to an already great meal.

In the end, there was no room for dessert, but by that time, I was sold on this place and can't wait to get back here to eat again!

Happy Eating!"
371,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was our favorite while staying inVegas. The breakfast was amazing. I had the brown sugar and banana pancake which will haunt me now that I'm gone because it was soooo good.
372,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Very few places live up to the claim of ""putting a twist"" on traditional cuisine. The Hash House is one of them. The dishes we had were familiar, but new. Is hits the emotion of ""steak and potatoes"" meal you had as a kid, the it's been layered with so many other flavors that is creates a new and profound experience. The portions to say the least are large. I eat a lot, and I was glad my wife and I split the entree. The kids meals are sure to be a crowd pleaser, but don't be fooled by the fact that they say they are for kids. My 3-year old's pancake was the size of a deflated rugby ball.

I'm for sure planning on coming again!!"
373,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were staying at the Linq and weren't about to pay holiday prices at a buffet near by. This place is SUPER popular so come knowing that you'll have to wait a little especially if you are with a larger party. 

Come with an appetite if you plan on ordering pancakes because they are insanely HUGE! 

I ate about half of mine and I was stuffed to the brim."
374,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Be scared, be very scared....

in a good way.  This was my first time atHash House A Go Go and wow was shocked to see how big the portions were.  I got a simple plate of scrambled eggs, bacon and hash browns and a biscuit and I couldnt even finish it all.  Another member of our party had their famous chicken and waffles and the plate was a marvel.  

Our waiter was great, very attentive and had a funny attitude that we all enjoyed.  Really enjoyed my visit here.  Its a little tricky to find as you have to take a small elevator up to the restaurant itself, but its well worth the treck!"
375,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of my favorite places to visit in Vegas. The name made me nervous, but it was recommended by my hotel to give it a try so we did and I am so glad! The food is delicious and the portions are huge. We made a reservation, but didn't need it. When we arrived, we were seated in less than 20 mins. I ordered the crab cake eggs Benedict. WOW! Is all I can say. The mashed potatoes are so good. I only ate half, but I took my potatoes home. I never take food to go, but that's how good it was. Definitely give this place a try. Huge portions and decent prices. One of our best, but cheaper meals while in Vegas. Casual and good for couples, friends, and family for sure."
376,Hash House A Go Go,5,Nice place. Huge portions. Been packed both times I've been here but they get you in really quick. The Bloody Mary's are great as is everything else. Probably one of those must visit places when you come to Vegas.
377,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First time here and it definitely will not be my last! I came here over the EDC weekend and it was PACKED. My group of six waiting for about 30 minutes to be seated around 2pm on a Saturday. After seated the waiter did let us know that it would be another 45 minutes after taking our orders until we received our food. That was probably the only issue I had with this place. I was starving but I think I can definitely say the food I devoured made the wait worthwhile. 

Firstly, I'd like to start off saying that their prices may seem very high at a first glance on the menu but after seeing the GIGANTIC food portions I found the prices to be decent. I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (this also appeared on an episode of Man Vs. Food) and let me just say it is simply AMAZING. I don't think I've ever had something quite like it. It comes with fresh spinach, smoked bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, chipotle cream, scrambled eggs, and delicious fried chicken. This plate is meant to be shared but if you're a fatty like me, I didn't share and was happy to take home left overs for my late night muchies hehe. Each bite I would try to get a little piece of everything into my fork to make the perfect bite each time. SO WORTH. I think the chipotle cream really seals the deal and puts everything together. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection as well. Overall, i was very happy with my food and I think my food belly afterwards proves it. I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again."
378,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portions on portions on portions!

Hash House A Go Go is located inside the LINQ Hotel on the 2nd floor. Just an FYI -- unless you have Verizon, you won't likely have cell service to reach out to your friends if you're meeting up... but they do have free WiFi. We came for lunch and it was about a 20 minute wait for our party of 5. All individuals in your party must be present in order to be seated.

I ordered the Andy's Famous Sage Fried Chicken Breast which came with a maple reduction, two eggs (I had mine scrambled), bacon mashed potatoes, and biscuits (with a side of white gravy). Everything was hearty, flavorful, and filling! I barely made a dent in my meal but I was stuffed with whatever I ate. The pricing is fair for the amount of food that you get.

The service was friendly but slow throughout our meal. Thankfully we were engrossed in our conversation so we were too busy to notice.

A must try in Vegas, especially if you're in the mood for breakfast food at any hour of the day since it's open 24/7."
379,Hash House A Go Go,5,"AWESOME food... Reasonalbe prices.  Massive portions..DELICIOUS....

Restaurants in general are average at best to me...  Generally a 3 star is a good rating.   However, despite the reviews that the portions are too large or the food needs salt....  Great news...  Salt is free here and in a convenient shaker located next to some spicy black stuff in a shaker too...  So, if you need more seasoning... Season away, it's FREE!... Huh...

Yes, the portions are massive and I am a hungry kinda Midwestern farm boy....  Food cooked to perfection.  If the portion is too large, you don't have to eat it all...it's ok if you don't; really...    

Price is more than reasonable for the portion size and being a Vegas restaurant.   There are healthy options of fresh fruit, , egg whites, etc.... And then there is the remainder of the menu filled with deliciousness....   This isn't just a breakfast food place; they have it all.

Give it a try; I know you will like it......"
380,Hash House A Go Go,1,"15 minute wait- not bad.
Hot cocoa-all bad. Looked like the cup and saucer were drizzled with cocoa powder and syrup. Very little whip cream. 
Bf ordered the bacon waffle.
I ordered the 2 egg combo with bacon and the grilled French toast.
Waitress commented on how delicious the French toast was.
I shoulda known.
Bacon waffle was wack. Not hot. Butter didn't melt. Bacon was basically inserted into the waffle which was split open. He expected a bacon waffle meaning bacon pieces cooked into the waffle. 
Grilled French toast. No Bueno.
The toast came out with a banana, split open, grilled, then slapped on top of the toast. Literally a whole banana with skin on. Ew a slimy banana on top of French toast. The maple reduction helped so I didn't need syrup but man did the banana gross me out. 
Overall large portion size but in this case size doesn't matter. I would possibly give this place another shot because the sage fried chicken looks good but for breakfast never again."
381,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Service was very slow, buttermilk pancake was lukewarm, tough, and tasted like it was made from a generic mix. I felt like it was incredibly overpriced for the quality of the food/service."
382,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg... my mouth is still watering... service was beyond excellent. Server was quick and consistently checked in. Food was out within minutes and honestly, it's great bang for buck. 

I really recommend checking this place out!"
383,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I first saw this on  Man vs. Food. Although I don't eat meat, I love sharing the Sage-Fried chicken Benedict. the chipotle sauce is amazing. it's not an ordinary Benedict, you will not find hollandaise sauce here. the portion are gigantic, definitely a great place if your into sharing. the smores mocha is a must if you like those warm drinks. we come here anytime we visit sin city."
384,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Was a hour wait, but so worth it! Had the BLT bloody Mary and that was awesome. Also the fried chicken Benedict was outstanding and way to much to eat!!!"
385,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The service is always great.  The food is amazing, and comforting.  It comes in huge portions, so bring your appetite."
386,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've been here twice.  I'm more impressed with the portions than the flavor.  First visit, I had chicken and waffles.  It was huge.  All the entrees are huge.  But flavor just wasn't there.  Next visit, I had biscuits and gravy.  Again, average.  They do have great bloody mary's, but I wouldn't return for the food.  Plus, the wait is usually 1 hr.  If you want to try this place, go on an off time to avoid the wait."
387,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What a perfect place for really good food and amazing service! 

We are staying at The Mirage and found this spot here on Yelp! The ratings were great so we decided to come on in. 

We had a great server TONY & He was in point, super friendly and speedy with our food! 

my boo had the ranchero meal and I had the salmon hash! Both meals were large and in charge but deeeeelicious!

Btw, we saw everyone order the sage chicken & waffles and honestly 2 people can enjoy that meal! 

Portions are large so enjoy!!!!!"
388,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was amazing worth the wait! Only downside was no Dr. Pepper. Service was good. Once we were sat after we ordered wasnt long before our food arrived!
389,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Go!!!!  Do not let a wait deter you, you will not be disappointed!

We went two mornings in a row for breakfast because it was just that good!  You can visit the bar while you wait and get a drink - get the bloody mary!  If your party is small, scope the bar out, as it's first come first serve at the bar and you might get a seat sooner than waiting on a table.  

We were very pleased with everything at Hash House!  My only advise - the portions are HUGE, you need only to order one item - plan on sharing."
390,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food at this restaurant was great! The size of their pancakes and waffles is so insane! The inly thing is that it took them 40 minutes to seat us and 40 minutes to bring us our food.
391,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was outstanding and our server was very personable and attentive. The only drawback is wait time for food to come out of the kitchen. If you aren't in a hurry the. You should absolutely make a stop.
392,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Our trip to Vegas, I knew i had to try Hash House A Go Go, of course going inside The Quad you would expect a line for Hash House A Go Go, they told us the wait was about 20 minutes but it was a lot faster than expected.  Sitting down our server gave us amazing customer service.  The food was amazing, I had the sage chicken with the bacon mash potatoes.  No need for extra sauce, the food was perfect on its own. Will be coming back on our next visit in March.  Hoping for the same great food and service. If you are in Vegas, this is a place you must stop by at. The portions are enormous. GO FOR THE FOOD AND SERVICE IT IS WORTH IT!"
393,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First, don't go here if you are ""low carb."" My friend and I went once during our trip and ate ""low carb"" and that was just silly.  The next time we went all out.  The extra weight is worth it!  You do not want to miss this place; the pancakes are bigger than the plates and all the food is prepared perfectly. Seriously, this is a breakfast haven.
Pic--blueberry and lemon curd pancakes--wowza!"
394,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food as always, portions are huge takes two people to finish one dish. I always get the snickers pancake. Love it"
395,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was incredibly underwhelmed by this restaurant. It smells like old dirty carpet in the restaurant. My husband ordered Andys Special (I think that's what it's called) which was fried chicken, eggs, tomatoes, bacon, mashed potatoes and a biscuit. The best thing about this dish was the chicken, which wasn't amazing. The biscuit was crunchy on the outside and dough like on the inside, the bacon was basically raw, the mashed potatoes were thick and flavorless and the tomato just seemed out of place. 

We also tried the snickers pancake and that was also not amazing. There were actual snickers in it which was cool,  but the pancake itself was very thick and dry. I was expecting a fluffy and moist pancake....it almost tasted like box mix.

Everything on the menu was overpriced also...which is expected in Vegas I suppose, but the food isn't worth it at all."
396,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very cool breakfast spot with huge portions. We saw this on diners,drive ins and dives and had to try it. I love huge portions!!

When we first got there, people filled the lobby but we were only quoted a 15-20 min wait. They move pretty quickly and the place is big to accommodate a lot of people. The only thing that annoyed me was at the hostess stand they had a sign saying if you take a selfie at their station and post it you can get $5 off of $25. I did that and they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. They should take the sign down if they are not going to honor that. 

For a good selection they have everything you can think of for breakfast. They have a huge chicken and waffle tower that I saw on TV. I was in the mood for pancakes though. They have a few different flavors that are hard to choose from like snickers, apple cinnamon, banana and red velvet. After consulting with the waiter, I got red velvet. The pancakes came out quickly and it is as big as my head!! I wouldn't order more than one because they are huge. I also got a side of eggs and ate everything. 

I liked that the red velvet pancake tasted like a pancake and not a dessert. Come with an appetite or else your going to waste your money lol"
397,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hubby and I split the fried chicken and waffles.   The chicken was good, not great.  The waffle was hard.  The biscuit was crumbling and flavorless.  Yes, the portions were large, but who cares if the food isn't that terrific?"
398,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Go go to hash a go go.  This place is the best spot for breakfast we tried. It is a must for a real bad hangover. They offer a huge selection of choices and all of them are large enough to feed two. 
The eggs were cooked to perfection and the potatoes were spot on. The bacon was my favorite part. It was greasy and crispy. Just what a tired, hungover guy needs. 
They serve mojitos and margaritas while you wait because you will wait. 
Many times the wait can be an hour. So grab a buzzer and go gamble for a few minutes. Our friend is a diamond member and we got in real quick. 
Wake up early and try this place out. You will not regret it. Oh and don't forget they offer a huge beer in a paper bag."
399,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Just like a bunch of others, I went here because of MVF.

Went with the BLT bloody mary, and the sage fried chicken and waffles. The portions are GINORMOUS, so come hungry. My drink tasted just like a BLT in cocktail form. It comes with a piece of toast, lettuce, and a strip of bacon. What a crazy idea, but it works somehow. The bacon infused waffles were good. Especially if you like the whole salty & sweet combination. Not really sure about the sage fried chicken, though. It was definitely lacking flavor, and was missing something. I also tried the fried chicken benedict Adam was raving about; was not impressed. The chipotle sauce was good, but collectively the dish was just ok.

I'll definitely come back to try the other dishes they have here."
400,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We started out rocky as we couldn't get anybody to wait on us.   Once they did, we waited long again for coffee.  This should be really easy folks.

I ordered a snickers flapjack and my husband ordered the french toast, ham and egg tractor menu item.   Omg, my flapjack was enormous.   My husbands plate was also huge.  We could easily have split either of the items

Food was good, not great.  Couldn't really tell it was a snickers bar, just something sweet in the flapjack.   His French toast was the thickest I have ever seen.  He really liked it.  The ham was about the thinnest piece of ham I have ever seen, but was good.

Overall good experience.   I would return, but would definitely share a meal.  So much food goes to waste it makes me sad.  Coffee, even the decaf, was tasty."
401,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I read reviews to try to find a great brunch spot for the day after my Vegas elopement, and I made a great choice with Hash House a Go Go. It was hard to find, but we finally got there, and the wait was a bit crazy. No big, we found seats at the bar and settled in with coffees and Bloody Marys. She got the regular (damn good!); I got the bacon-infused vodka (even better!). Best Bloody Mary I had in Vegas, for sure. The coffee was good, too.

We totally should have shared something, as our portions were way too much for either of us and our hotel had no mini-fridge to keep our leftovers. I got the sage-fried chicken & waffles and she got some scramble thing. The scramble was good, but the chicken & waffles are really where it's at.

Good service, great food, great drinks. Don't miss it!"
402,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are HUGE here. My friend wanted to go since it was on Man vs. Food, and since last time she was in Vegas it was like an hour wait.

Tip: go at a weird/off time (10:30am, 11am) because it will only be about a 20 minute wait. We went on a Sunday at like 10:45. When we left there was a HUGE line of people waiting for lunch.

ALSO text ""Vegas"" to 227466, and you will get Total Rewards offers - another reason we went here is because we got a BOGO for the Tractor Driver Combo, which comes with sausage/potatoes/bacon (your choice), pancake or waffle, and eggs. I also got ham on the side which was delicious. We upgraded to their specialty pancakes for $1 extra and they were HUGE. We finished about 1/2 of that, each. All of the other food I saw people eating was ginormous too ... I think you can split portions but they do charge a small fee for doing that.

I would come back to Hash House next time I'm in Vegas! Kind of wish it wasn't at the Quad (aka Imperial Palace - lots of construction going on there right now, Jan. '13) but oh well. Only con was that the service was pretty slow, it took about 1/2 an hour to get our food, but can't really beat $7 each for breakfast ($13.95 for the Tractor combo normally)."
403,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best breakfast I've had in Vegas this trip! Will be my first choice on return trips. 
The food was great, the staff friendly and very helpful. Overall, was the dining highlight of this trip.
See y'all soon!"
404,Hash House A Go Go,4,"huge portions and SO NOM NOM NOM

1. bacon cheddar mashed potatoes: DELISH 
BUT: eating it was kind of hard because there were long strips of bacon underneath a blanket of cheese. sounds delish but honestly I wish the bacon was cut up or something. As much as I love bacon i didn't like how I would be basically a crap ton of bacon with no potato. boo. 

2. Sage Fried Chicken Benedict: *dies* SO GOOD
* I personally like to eat things separately and not have my food touching (OCD much?? haha) but this dish OMG it only tastes good if you mix it up!! So... basically

Eating it separately: meh
Eating it together: AHHHHH! NOM NOM NOM ^__^ 

Go there but be prepared to share!!! Also, they do have a split fee charge, but if you order a side they won't charge the fee. so yeah DO IT 

** My only problem with the benedict is that the biscuits were kind of hard :/ like seriously hard. blech. BUTTTT once its covered in the sauce and mashed potatoes its like VOILA nom nom biscuit."
405,Hash House A Go Go,3,"To tell you the truth I was kind of disappointed by the amount of food that this restaurant serves. It made me sick to my stomach seeing all the waste happening. Looking at my neighbors table, I proposed my friend to share a meal and even with this, I could not finish my plate.
The food was good, don't get me wrong but it's just too much!
It's cafeteria style so very casual. The meal were all looking very good, well decorated.
Maybe if you have hungry teenagers that would be a slam dunk or if you are a person with huge appetite."
406,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You go for the experience, and the food is just a plus. We ordered the chicken + waffles and oh my goodness... it was insanely huge. We should've ordered from the regular breakfast menu, but hey, yolo in Vegas right? Aside from taking off 5 years from my life, sugar levels spiking, this is a fun place to try but I wouldn't go back."
407,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing each time I've gone there, the one in the Linq area can be a bit busy at meal time so expect a wait, otherwise great staff and even more amazing food."
408,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We went for brunch and there was a wait, but the host staff got us seated very quickly. 

Out group mostly had the fried chicken and one got the meatloaf sandwich. The fried chicken and waffles is a must, you could probably split it between 3-4 people. The flavors go together very well and the price is very reasonable. The meatloaf sandwich was outstanding. 

Our food did take a while to come out; however, it was appreciated that our server let us know ahead of time that it would be use everything was made from scratch and there were no heat lamps. 

Definitely a great place to go to nurse your hangover!"
409,Hash House A Go Go,5,"was in Vegas for business and a co worker insisted that this was a Must Go eatery. Glad he did . The chicken and waffles were outstanding. Crispy chicken, moist inside and the waffles had a great vanilla flavor and crisp bacon inside. the portion was substantial too. Although most of us were fully, we did order the bred pudding hoping the 20 min wait it requires would let our food settle in. we were unable to finish the bred pudding between the 4 of us but it too was delicious. Great service, clean and all around a good experience."
410,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Located inside the Quad Hotel, it can be a little difficult to find, but it is so worth the search. After hearing that the portions here were pretty generous, we were hesitant about whether to order two separate dishes or split one between the two of us. 
We ended up ordering Andy's Sage Fried Chicken ($14.99), a plate that contained all of the food groups I can think of. A delicious concoction of crispy, double-fried chicken with their delicious hash browns, a kick of chipotle with a biscuit, this plate can be easily shared by a very hungry couple.
The service was fantastic - our server Billy was sincere, funny and attentive, showing us what true American hospitality is about.
I highly recommended this gem of a brunch spot if you're in Vegas - skip the pricey hotel buffet and get a fresh and delicious dish here. The coffee is small at $3 here, but it's super fresh with bottomless refills."
411,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Heard about this place from my sister.  Simply stated, their breakfast menu runs about 15-17 dollars for something like pancakes, meat and two eggs.  I think that is a lot for breakfast.  But what you get is huge size servings of those items that are quickly prepared by a competent and attentive staff.  When I say huge, I mean blueberry pancakes with real blueberries in them, that are so large that only the hungriest or greediest person can eat even one of them.  But yes, they were delicious.  One breakfast entree will feed two people with a normal appetite.  Last of all they have a huge variety of breakfast choices, including something with chicken on top that made you want to snatch it from the other customer.. Yummy."
412,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A friend told me about the spot she said it was her favorite place! I am glad I followed her advice! 

If you want to unbuckle some belt buttons well you have come to the right place. Inside of this warm and cozy ranch diner mashup you will find some of the most tasty food on the Vegas strip! We ordered and the server was a really great guy. The food came so fast I didn't get a chance to think about it good. 

One entree is all you need the portions are heavy here! I shared two with my friend and we were stuffed like turkeys on thanksgiving! ordered the Andy's Sage fried chicken with maple reduction. It comes with bacon, mash potatoes, and 2 eggs. 

The chicken comes deep fried in a corn Flake batter its crispy and filleted so not bone to get in the way. Tender and juicy with just the right amount of golden crispy flavor. I had my eggs scrambled hard with cheese and they were perfect! With a little of the syrup in them. The eggs were all you could ask for eggs to be! But the potatoes OMG the potatoes were covered with crispy bacon with just a little maple syrup on top. They were mashed to perfection! The plate comes garnished with some caramel straws and orange two very fresh tomatoes and a melon wedge. Every thing was fresh and tasty .

The waffles and chicken is just as delicious. The same crispy chicken. With delicious waffles but the best part is when you bite inside... ITS BACON! This how a waffle should be! Tasty bacon with crispy waffle in every bite. 

This is what a diner wants to be. It was warm and comfy."
413,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Excellent food, sketchy service. Yesterday got a table at 8 am, service was great, food was great. Today, 8:30 on a Wednesday, 10-15 min wait for table so they said grab a bar seat. 2 were open. Had to ask if they were being used as old napkins/utensils/drinks were setting there. They cleaned one up,gave me a menu, and then never came back for order....too busy making drinks. 15 minutes of waiting the girl finally asked what I would like. I'd like to pay for my one cup of coffee ( never got to a refill, they never asked).
 They did say it was on the house.
Gotta pay better attention to the ppl seated at the bar,folks. Similar happened in January when they lost a credit card at bar and pretty much neglected patrons. I let that go as hopefully a onetime deal. Maybe I was wrong?

My advice. If you want to eat, get a table. Even with a wait you'll probably get fed faster.

Food, when you do get it ,IS amazing though. Table wait staff great as well."
414,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Food and service good but today, Sunday lunch time crowded.  We were told the wait would be 10 minutes.  After 25 minutes we were told they already called us.  Impossible we were sitting right next to check in.  Employee at check in started to argue with us we were wrong when we told them no.  The whole time employees at front were yelling at each other loudly and not paying attention to any of the customers.  First impressions count...will go to the one in Henderson from now on..."
415,Hash House A Go Go,5,Been here a few times and it's our favorite breakfast place anywhere.  The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict or the HH Original Benedict is all we need and that'll fuel you up for the whole day.  It's very easy to get carried away and order too much so it's best to share.
416,Hash House A Go Go,1,"(at The Quad formerly known as the Imperial Palace) Parking is at the rear in one of those famous Vegas Labyrinths except it looks abandoned, dirty and unsafe, park in Valet. 

The waiting staff was prompt and courteous, restaurant has seen a lot of action but still clean, just a little beat up.

I started with the BLT Bloody Mary , the Bacon was good.....I left half my drink , there was something tangy missing in the drink it was just your basic mix with Tabasco....

For lunch I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, It was this towering plate with massive pieces of food, the Honeydew melon slice on it was delicious, the chicken breast was dry, it had scrambled egg on top of the fried chicken which was decent and sharp cheddar cheese on top of that.....The cheese tasted burnt with an aftertaste , all that was on top of a layer of mashed potatoes which were decent in taste, there was also some slices of tomato and spinach leaves....I left most of the food not because it was too much but because it did not taste great as the legend says. The melon was great though.

I believe this is a place to fix a hungover  than just a place to go have lunch just because, I do try everything twice just in case the first time sucks so in the future I will go to another location and give it another chance."
417,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The food is meh. The pancake is too thick and gets dried out. Potatoes were average. They serve Pepsi products which is gross. It's unbelievably loud. And depending on who seats you, they won't seat you until your whole group is there. The problem with that is, the waiting area is tiny, so if people want to go to the casino, they can't because there's no cell service. 

Our waiter was TERRIBLE! Like, condescending jerk, should not work with people AT ALL! I believe his name was Tony. Worst waiter in all of my experiences living in Las Vegas for 12 years. If we ever go back and I get him, I'll walk out."
418,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is amazing. The ingredients Hash House mixes together work wonders on the taste buds. The Soy based Bar B' Que sauce used on my pork ribs was perfect. I highly recommend Hash House A Go Go to anyone within a 100 mile radius of one of their fabulous restaurants. The trip and time will be well worth it. Come hungry, leave happy. The staff @ the I.P. Hash House in Las Vegas are simply marvelous. All staff I came in contact with were funny, knowledgeable, and caring. Thanks to Steve @ the bar for the recommendation of the  Slow cooked Pork Ribs. Enjoy and tell EVERYONE u know about Hash House A Go Go."
419,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You definitely need to order the chicken ceaser salad! It's beyond flavorful and delicious! Also, they serve very large portions!"
420,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow what a great place. It took about 30 minutes for a table for two, I would have wait an hour. I had the fried chicken mash potatoes and egg. Their food is just great. Our waitress was outstanding, best service. I wish I could remember her name, but we were eating around 10:30 an today near the bar and at a table in the back."
421,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This Hash House A Go Go does not do reservations (However the one over at the Sands hotel does), and I say this because when we called to reserve a table for about 8 people they never specified which Hash House A Go Go they were and we showed up on a Friday morning and the place was packed.

The food portions are HUGE and definitely worth the price they charge you for (however the taste not so much), the waitress was amazing and she was very helpful and always attentive to our needs. When it comes to the actual flavor of the food it was very middle of the road and nothing to rave about. I got the corned beef sandwich on texas toast and while the corned beef was really good  the texas toast didn't really have any flavour to it. Another thing was their side salad w/cucumber ranch dressing was completely bland tasting and the croutons were not fresh at all. Finally the one thing that did save the meal was their nitro coffee...that was DELICIOUS!"
422,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of the only breakfast spots that I'm aware of. It's central located at The Linq.  Huge portions. Good food. Always busy, but worth it."
423,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Bring your appetite. Everything here is huge and delicious.  You get full just watching the waiters bring out everyone's food while you wait. Nice, clean place and great people watching. I love the reactions everyone has. The bloody mary's are great!"
424,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We decided on this place due to its great past reviews.

A quick 20 minute wait later and we were seated at a comfortable booth with a view of the football game. 

Drinks came quickly and I got a very messy but delicious hot chocolate, minus the marshmallows.

I ordered the mushroom,spinach,artichoke and sun dried tomato hash, which is their speciality. They were really good at modifying the dish when I asked. It came with two eggs a biscuit it and a piece of watermelon. It looked great in a large skillet and was delicious. It was a large portion, if I wasn't sharing there is no way I would have been able to get through it. 
I felt the hash could have had more spinach but other than that it all hit the spot.
So if you like breakfast with big portions for great value this is the place to come!"
425,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food and service were great!!! Be prepared to have take home food. The serving sizes are enormous!!! Ate there twice on our trip to Vegas.
426,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I first learned about this place on Man v. Food and Bacon Paradise on the Travel channel.  Since the first time i tried this place, Ive ate here about 3-4 times already.  I guess you can consider this as an accumulation review of all the times i have been here. 

Location:  There are actually two Hash House A Go Go in Vegas...one off the strip and on on the strip (this one).  The one on the strip is a hidden gem located on the second floor of Imperial Palace now known as The Quad.  Prepare to wait anywhere from 15 mins to over an hour.   Luckily they give you a pager so you can still wander inside the casino.

Food: The food here in my opinion is actually pretty good.  The price is relatively cheap (most stuff are around $15 - $20) considering all the other places on the strip and the portion size are HUGE.  You can easily share one dish.  Hash House is known for their 

Sage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower (bacon built inside the waffle).  Everytime someone orders this the room tends to get quite and people stare going wtf. 

Hash House Farm Benedict  (Seen on Man v. Food);

BBLT (Imagine if you let someone who hates lettuce and tomato but loves bacon to build his own BLT with the only catch being there has to be at least one piece of lettuce and tomato...lol).

The only thing i didnt like too much was their 1lb Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar stuffed burger.  The burger was very bland and lacked flavor.

Overall this is a good place to go to if you don't want to spend too much money and wanna feel food preggo (if you dont share)."
427,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I absolutely love this place! My husband and I make it a point to come here every time we come to Vegas. I've never been disappointed here and there is never enough time (or room in my belly) to try everything I want. One of my favorites is the Hash House Original Benedict with Mashed potatoes, biscuits, spinach, tomatoes, poached eggs(or they call them basted, not totally sure what the difference is) and roasted red pepper cream sauce. Sooo good! The portions are massive and the HH original benedict is about $15 or so, so you can save some money by just ordering that and splitting with someone else. It always sounds like a good idea before we get there, but then I can't decide and we usually end up ordering two entrees. The banana-brown sugar pancake is awesome too and doesn't even need syrup. It's massive as well of course. I can usually only eat about 1/4 of it. The breakfast quesadilla has potatoes and a bunch of other yummy stuff, also perfect. I'm not a big fan of bloody mary's, until I had one here. Awesom bloody marys and nice and big. Perfectly seasoned and not too spicy. Can't wait to have one in a few days. Vegas Baby, Vegas!!!"
428,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Very good, maybe the best pancakes I've ever had. Servings are giant and prices low. The Strip's gem for brunch, hands down."
429,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions of great food. I always like to go to this spot once during a trip. A bit better for breakfast than lunch. Banana pancakes are the bomb.
430,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was okay as hard to screw up waffles with bacon cooked inside.  Service was frentic and I was sitting at bar and it took almost 30 minutes for that aforementioned waffle to show up. They recommended people to order before even could get a seat at the bar.

It is interesting to see that a town that built itself on the cheap steak and egg buffet is not serving up trendy farm to tablish breakfast places where one dish cost more than the buffet used it.

Overall not worth the wait as almost rather gotten hot cakes at a local mcdonalds then eat here."
431,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Maybe I wouldn't have had such high expectations if I hadn't been to the Hash House in San Diego (which is fucking amazing by the way), but I was definitely disappointed with this location. Our server informed us there was some sort of catastrophe in the kitchen and our food was going to take awhile, which was fine. It wasn't the servers fault our food took an hour to hit the table. However, while we were waiting, the server never came back to update us on the food, refill our drinks, nothing. Over an half passed. I could see our server joking around and talking to the other workers behind the bar. Finally our lukewarm food comes and still no one checks on us. No one ever refilled our drinks. I've had the same drinks in SD and the presentation was much better. My gfs champagne supernova in SD had a sugar rim and garnishes. This one literally looked like dirty dish water, had no garnish, and our server told us to ""make sure to give it a good stir"" because the bartender sure as hell didn't. Then I had to hunt down someone else to get my check because no one ever came to our table. Not going back."
432,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had heard so much about this place, so even though we were both starving , we endured a 30 minute wait and it was definitely worth it. Service was efficient and fun, the atmosphere is upbeat and then the food. Wow are these some big plates! Had the chorizo jalapeno hash, the chorizo is made in house and is a perfect balance of flavor and heat, without the overuse of salt that so often happens, served over crispy potatoes it was delicious. My wife had the sage chicken which is HUGE! Flavor again was superb, but unless you have a huge appetite, get this one to share. All around a great place and the best breakfast I have found so far in Vegas."
433,Hash House A Go Go,3,"KILLER PORTIONS
Need I say more?

After thinking hard on what to order, we ordered these:
-Andy's sage fried chicken & bacon waffle tower drizzled with hot maple reduction & fried leeks: I thought I would have a heart-attack once I saw how huge it was...in person! Yup...But an enjoyable one, of course... I was actually surprised that it tasted as good as it was! All the flavors go so well together & the fried chicken is surprisingly not greasy at all! & the waffle . . . I love waffles, but this one has bacon pieces inside them!!!Bacon-anything insures ""yummy"" flavor, so as you can tell, this dish was excellent!
-House hash with fresh mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with biscuit: again, this comes packed in a big skillet, so you can  guess how big the portion is . . .This was definitely more of a healthier choice from the menu, but the portion...will not make it so healthy  afterall ;)

I would probably cook this much food for the whole family; not for one person-
only thing i recommend you at hash house a go go is that you think about the portions & share accordingly . . . 
We ordered two dishes for four people & we still had some left-over!
So unless you want to take home big portions as your next meal, sharing is caring!"
434,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Such an awesome place to eat! Would recommend to anyone visiting the strip to check this place out for breakfast. 

While the prices are still around $15-20 per person for a plate, you can't beat what you get. The portions are enormous and SO delicious. 

I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, which came with 3 hand-sized waffles (strips of bacon inside) and two large breasts of the best friend chicken ever! It was so well cooked and the flavors were great. 
My 3 friends ordered the other chicken breakfast dish and loved it as well! Came with bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a big biscuit! 

The atmosphere is nice, you don't feel rushed or cramped together in the restaurant, and the wait staff is nice too. We only waited about 25-30 mins for a 4 person booth, which is easily spent in the casino downstairs."
435,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So for starters the wait was between 25-35 min. Well worth the wait! 
Our waitress was awesome and attentive. 
Crazy good good with more than generous portions! 
Bloody Mary was a must have! 
Will be returning next trip!"
436,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is pretty good. The food amount was overwelmingly hugee!!!! I highly doubt that most people can finish their food. 
 The wait was about 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 mins.. but felt shorter because they were calling names pretty fast and often.. sucks to go when you are really hungry cause you have to wait and there is also cooking time so by the time my food came out i wasnt hungry as i waa before :( but all in all everything was good and our server was also good. Very friendly and checked up on us often. :)"
437,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House is a must place to go go. They have everything from breakfast to traditional american cuisine. Be warned the portions are HUGE! I would recommend sharing a meal with someone. I got the chicken Benedict, it was so good. It has biscuits topped with eggs, bacon, chicken, and a delicious gravy. It also comes with some fruit and cut potatoes on the side. This entree is a man vs food stand out and it definitely lives up to its name. My boyfriend and two of my friends got the meatloaf. They all really enjoyed it. The gravy on top of the meatloaf and mashed potatoes was so good! Another one of my friend got the chicken and waffles. The waffles had a nice surprise inside of them... BACON! The chicken was moist and very tasty. My last friend got the salmon plate. She also enjoyed this entree and thought the salmon was prepared very well. Our server was so sweet and so attentive. We didn't get any drinks here but I would love to come back and try their BLT Bloody Mary! :)"
438,Hash House A Go Go,4,"At Hash house a Go-go I ate the tallest chicken and waffles I have ever eaten. I do not know how, but I ate it all, and the portion was huge. It was good, but no maple syrup, so I removed a star. I don't like pancake syrup.

The place was crowded and we did have to wait a while before being seated, but it was still a good experience. Service was very good. I may come back."
439,Hash House A Go Go,5,"From the looks when you walk in,you'll see a lot of people waiting however, the wait will only be like 15mins. Our server was super nice and attentive. I ordered the Texas ranchero' oooo soooooo good the portions were huge! Pics and vids don't do justice of how big these plates really are. Would def recommend this place if your on your phone in a vegas hotel in the morning trying to figure out where to eat.. pick this spot won't be disappointed plus it's a lively environment"
440,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing choices on the menu. Very difficult to decide. Settled on banana peanut butter pancakes which were awesome!! And pork hash special. As you have seen others post, the portions are huge. Service was s little slow because they were very busy as it was Father's Day. Would definitely go back."
441,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I give this place 50 stars. The food, service and prices. EVERY SINGLE MEAL can be shared with someone. If you can eat a meal by yourself, and finish it, hats off to you."
442,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is fantastic!!! I love that it is  open 24 hrs .. as a Vegas restaurant should be. My favorite dish is the roasted lemon chicken. It's delicious. The food is amazing and they do a great job with presentation. I will return to this joint every time I visit Las Vegas. Oh.... they also have great service!!! Which is a definite plus!!
443,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions here are huge and despite the line, we were in and out in no time flat.  Very well priced and the food was pretty good.  I would definitely share a plate with my husband next go because we had way too much food."
444,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is a great place for brunch, esepecially for large groups.
Obviously, if you're going on a weekend, expect a decent wait.  Our group of 8 had to wait about an hour to get seated on Sunday around 11am.  But there was plenty to keep us entertained until it was our turn to eat.
I had the chicken and waffles, which was amazing.  The chicken is cooked perfectly - I loved the sweetness that the maple reduction added to the chicken.  And the biscuit that comes on the side was also delicious.  The only downside (which might just be me) is how big it is.  I wish I had known before ordering so that I could've shared.  I couldn't even eat a third of it, and it's not one of those dishes that make for good leftovers.  So if you decide to get this, share with a friend!
The other winner at our table was the quesadilla.  I didn't get to try it, but my friend loved it.
For any coffee drinkers, I'd recommend sticking with hot coffee.  I ordered an iced coffee and you basically get lukewarm coffee since they just throw some ice into their hot coffee."
445,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was so good! Enormous servings of food! Highly recommend to share a plate if you don't want a ton of leftovers
446,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place has been hyped by my friends who are Vegas regulars and now I know why - this place is GREAT.  Had the opportunity to go 3 different times and each time the food was great, the service by the wait-staff was just as impressive.....with the exception on one of those days, one of the hostesses on duty was pretty pretentious and kind of a total ""b"", she let me know the wait time would be 10 minutes because of the lunchtime rush...which was no problem, but after 30 minutes, we were not seated.    I would have been ""OK"" if she would have apologized if she had forgotten to seat us but instead, she said, ""Oh well, deal with it.""  That comment irritated me - which was clearly visible...to which the second hostess apologized and quickly found a seat for my group and I.  

I ordered my meal of their signature dish - chicken and bacon waffles and their rosemary infused ice tea....to quote Robin, ""Holy super sized meal, Batman!""....the portion was more than generous - I was able to share my meal with a friend and had enough food to take back to my hotel and share with another friend who had stayed behind to ""nurse a headache"".  After I paying  the bill, gave my  server a nice tip because he made sure all of his assigned tables were being taken care of.  As I walked past the hostess station, I gave the hostess who seated me and rectified the situation a tip as well.  As I gave her the tip, I noticed the hostess who ticked me off look over and I shot her a look and used her words, ""Oh well, deal with it!"" and walked out.  

I went back the following day for breakfast and what a different experience - great service....and the eggs benedicts and BLT Bloddy Mary were delicious.  

By the way, the Hash House, is open 24/7...so, don't pay attention to what the Hash House website says.    ....and don't mind the remodeling being done at the Quad Hotel."
447,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A co-worker recommended this place as a must breakfast/brunch place to go. We waited almost 1 hour to get a seat and our food. it was super busy but the place is fairly big so people were constantly arriving and leaving. I ordered the scrambled egg with Avocado,  bacon, onions and Swiss cheese and crispy potatoes. My husband ordered the Sage fried maple Chicken with mashed fried potatoes. I enjoyed my brunch, but my order would have been difficult to screw up. I didn't really care for the maple chicken because I prefer my chicken savory; though my husband liked it. The biscuits were very light and tasty with the strawberry jam. We were stuffed and had an entire meal leftover between our two plates. I'm not sure if we will come back just because the wait took a while and I'm personally not a breakfast person. If you love breakfast it's definitely worth checking out."
448,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I liked it enough, but my boyfriend thought it was sloppy. I got the Chourizo Hash and he got the HH Original Eggs Benedict.

Now we're not terribly healthy people, so my boyfriend's ""sloppy"" feedback doesn't have anything to do with him being offended by the portion size. Trust me, he ate the whole damn thing Man vs. Food style. I guess there's just food that MAKES you fat and then there's food that makes you FEEL fat just by looking at it.

Our waiter told me that the Chourizo Hash was the best hash they make, so that's what I got. It wasn't terribly spicy... pretty much perfect. Maybe too much for a hangover cure but good as a brunch item otherwise. The portion was huge and the potatoes were excellent.

My eggs were severely undercooked for over-medium... shoot, they were undercooked for sunny side up. I ate them anyway with no ill effects.

I enjoyed the presentation of mine (obviously the boyfriend was nauseated by his) and you definitely get plenty of quality, creative food here... but... I just can't vouch for it."
449,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House is not your typical brunch place. It takes comfort food to a whole other level. The plates here came in the size of 5 times the size of my face. One plate is definitely more than enough for one person. The pictures don't capture the portion size well, but trust me that the dishes are so much larger than they seem!

I ordered the corned beef hash, which came with a side of eggs, fresh fruit, and a biscuit as big as my hand. The corned beef hash was tasty but resembled something more like pulled pork. My friend ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles dish, which came with the chicken and waffles stacked in a high tower. He really enjoyed the dish and claimed it was one of the best fried chicken he has ever had. Also, the waffles came with bacon inside of them!"
450,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hash House is a chain that seems to be in a couple locations on the Vegas strip. I would equate their menu to Midwest food meets Claim Jumper. Lots of food, just not ""great"" food. Prices, as with all restaurants in Vegas, are relatively high, but, if you can take that large plate of food and walk away with a 'doggy bag' it makes it more reasonable. If you aren't eating all of it, I just see it as a waste of food....I'm just saying...
My breakfast was the sage fried chicken (a large breast of) with 2 eggs, veggies, and a whole lot of mashed potatoes, and a large biscuit with gravy... there was no way I could finish this. The sage chicken was pretty darn good, and super moist. The other items were rather standard. I wasn't thrilled with our server's opening line being one of ""low wages, heavy workload, and poor management""... doesn't set a good tone for a meal. 
I wasn't exactly impressed with Hash House, so won't be coming back."
451,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The wait is a long here but it's worth it, great food great staff huuuge portions. They take care of you here it's a lotta bang for the buck. 

The fried chicken Benedict is just weird it really didn't even have eggs in it at least my portion didn't. That was the only let down. I would come back."
452,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was great! My mom and I came for breakfast and I got the bacon waffles and a cappuccino. The cappuccino came with cocoa powder along the plate and was great. The waffle was simply divine. I personally wish I didn't do the bacon because it is inside the waffle, but I knew that ordering it so I cannot fault them for not being a huge fan of it. The waffle came with powdered sugar, butter, and syrup and was awesome. My mom tried it and she loved it and wanted to eat more. I highly suggest this place for breakfast if you are in Vegas."
453,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Overall, this was one of the best eating experiences in recent memory!!  I came here on a Sunday afternoon with some friends. It was my first time trying this place. I do remember it being featured on Man vs. Food. Located in the second floor of the Linq hotel, there was a 25 minute wait to an hour, but managed to get seated within a half hour or so. Until then, we used that time to take a look at the menu, so that by the time we were seated and served, we'd know what we wanted to order.

Since we were super hungry, it was a tough decision to make since there was such a variety of food entrees to choose from, whether you're craving something hearty to the more smaller and healthier  portions. I decided to order the HH Original. The dish featured a sweet but large helping of bacom mashed potatoes topped with two biscuits, two slices of thick bacon, tomato slices, spinach, and over easy eggs smothered in red, hot chipotle sauce.

Oh. My. God. First of all, the portion size was quite enormous. The size of these entrees are enough to keep you full the rest of the day. All that was left after I finished was a piece of biscuit. It was soooo worth the wait! The coffee to top it all off with was nice and fresh :)

Our server, Tawney,  was outstanding! She was super friendly and was excited aboout providing us with the best service possible, and she stuck to it. She happily shared past experiences of seeing people's reactions to the portion sizes, and also kept making sure our food arrived at our table in a promptly and timley manner. Such a wonderful experience for our first time here. The next time I want to come back to Vegas and crave for some good morning eats, Hash House A Go Go at The Linq is the place to go :)"
454,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I generally make it a point to avoid the Strip but it was 9:30 pm and I was tired of standard diner fare and sushi.  Ok, so the trip to Imperial Palace, parking in a structure, and walking through a casino blew as much as I expected it to, wasting time and energy (why I don't frequent the Strip) but it probably was only as bad as driving to the other side of town from campus to the other hash house.  

I was seated immediately by the hostess.  Unfortunately, that was the quickest part of the service, and I had to wait forever for the server to take my order and bring a drink out which was fine since I was not in a rush but was a little irritating since I was hungry.  That's when things started to get better.

Tangerine juice!  I can't believe somebody juiced it! It's like orange juice with a zing at the end.  For the entree, I had the sage fried chicken benedict which was ridiculously delicious.  Fried chicken breast, scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, and tomatoey cream sauce with a hint of sage made for a wicked combo.  It was both scrumptious and tasty, and I would say the best plate of food I've had in Vegas besides going to some signature chef place.  And it was huge!!  I barely touched the biscuits-I was too stuffed."
455,Hash House A Go Go,4,Portions are HUGE! I had the fried chicken eggs Benedict which was featured on Man Vs Food. Food was great but we should have shared a plate instead of ordering separately. Bloody Mary was tasty and for $16 you get a souvenir cup. Service was friendly but slow. Maybe they were short staffed when I was there but food and drinks took forever to come out. Also there were several open tables while the waiting area was packed.
456,Hash House A Go Go,5,I must say that the wait here is a lot shorter and moves a lot quicker than the Hash House located inside the M Resort. Upon arrival there was a very long line but the wait was barely fifteen minutes so don't be deterred by the lines. Staff members here are very helpful and they work hard to get you in and out in a timely manner! The food is grade A as it is at any Hash House. Definitely worth a couple tries!
457,Hash House A Go Go,4,"ordered the Sage Chicken and Bacon Waffles. Just how do they get the bacon into that waffle iron, fantastic! Sage fried chicken was two breasts, which required some additional salt to bring out the deep fried goodness. Overall pretty solid and a huge portion. Servers are very attentitive. The place gets packed so come before the 'walkers' come in."
458,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Why is this place popular?

Hash House is nasty as all get out. The pancakes are HUGE and hard! It's not light and fluffy or thick and yummy. It's just huge and hard. I did not eat it past one bite.

How do you get watered down ORANGE JUICE? Come here.

The place looks filthy and the chicken and waffles? Grosss. They stick this leaf thing in it that makes it smell bad. The syrup is yucky, the waffle is missing taste, and the chicken is dry and bland.

Epic fail. They deserve no stars."
459,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We visited Hash House A Go Go during our weekend trip to Vegas. It was the perfect meal on a Monday for brunch after having a ""rough"" weekend (if you know what I mean). 

We were a group of 7 and were seating in about 15 minutes or so.  We sat at the bar and had mimosas while we waited.  The tangerine mimosa is delicious.  The cups at the bar were just regular plastic cups and lacked presentation for those that like to have frilly drinks but the taste was on point. 

So, we were finally seated at our table and it took forever to even get some water on the table.  Being a group of 7, it was understandable but we waited quite a bit.  

Food: 
HUGE PORTIONS! Seriously, HUGE. The Sage Chicken and Waffles are delicious.  If I could've, I would've eaten it all. I wish I could've because it was so delicious.  The waffles have bacon inside of them.  That should say enough of how amazing this was. Everyone enjoyed their meal.  The hash was popular as well as the chicken with biscuits.  

The only reason I gave it a 4 was because of the wait once we were at the table.  Other than that, it was delicious and really hit the spot after a long weekend. 

Highly recommended!"
460,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I should have read reviews about this place before going. I was not prepared for the portion sizes! (not that I'm complaining)

I had the S'mores mocha, my husband had the Banana Latte. Both were good :)

i had the roast chicken has and he had the meatloaf hash. I couldn't even finish mine. somehow my husband managed to polish his off.

I would ask that there be some type of jam or butter to put on the biscuts that come w/ the hash. They're too dry to eat plain.

We went a few days before x-mas so i can't speak to the regular busy-ness of the restaurant since we were seated right away. Our waitress was friendly but a little slow to give us our check on the way out. oh well!

I'll totally go back next time i'm in town."
461,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So bomb.  The pancakes are bigger than my head (and I have a big head). Very fulfilling! The potatoes are good. Their mojitos are a must! The mint is actually fresh.  

The wait is pretty long. It goes by quick though. Warning: the hostess seemed very confused so when you give her your name.. Be specific and make sure she writes it down. We had a little issue. 

Total Rewards Members: They cannot add points to your card but if you show your receipt to the front desk afterwards, they can give you points. 

We had a really good server. He seemed overwhelmed at times but he was still on top of his game.  

Price was your average Vegas pricing haha."
462,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My favorite place to eat breakfast ever!! HUGE portions, love the French toast and blueberry pancakes!  The Orange juice is freshly squeezed!  I wish they had one closer to where I lived!!"
463,Hash House A Go Go,4,The best cornbeef hash I have EVER eaten!  I know they are known for the chicken & waffles...but I found the waffle to be too dense and chicken strips to be way over cooked.  But the cornbeef hash?! It was everything heaven offers on a plate!
464,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Saw this place on Man vs. Food and decided to give it a try. Everything is of MASSIVE proportions... so share with someone! I don't think I saw anyone finish a dish on their own. 

I had the sage fried chicken benedict. The chicken was definitely tasty and I think the best part about the whole dish. Otherwise, it was a gluttonous pile of potatoes, biscuit, and sauce (I could've done with less sauce for sure). 

The bad part of my experience? The place is popular, so we waited about 45min to get seated. That wasn't so bad since we were expecting the place to be packed. We already knew what we wanted so we ordered right away. 45 minutes later.... nothing. We read reviews saying it took a while to make stuff, but after a while we started getting suspicious... and then we watched several parties that were seated well after us get their food before us. When we finally caught the eye of our server and asked about our food, she went to check on it. The food came out a few minutes later. Explanation? Something like ""perfection takes time."" I don't think so. Not after we watched multiple parties that came in after us get their massive platters of food while we waited.

So kitchens lose orders sometimes... but I think our server should've noticed and checked on it if it was taking longer than usual.

The food was pretty good in a ""bad for you"" kind of way, but the service kind of dampened the experience for me. If I return, I'll hope that they don't lose my order again."
465,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Gluttons and Fatties unite!

Unfortunately, Hash House was a No Go for our party of 4.  While seated relatively promptly, we were forgotten about until we approached the hostess who summoned our server in order to have our order taken.  The wait time for our food, which only consisted of only two dishes, as a single dish can easily feed a European family of 4, took a surprising amount of time to arrive, given that it was past the usual breakfast dining time and just before the lunch period.  Our waiter was friendly, however, the breakfast food items were average in flavor.  

Portion sizes rival the waist sizes of the patrons - HUGE, so order wisely as nearly everyone, including the plus size customers were leaving large amounts of food, incredibly wasteful food concept restaurant."
466,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I'm  a big fan of heading to hash house for breakfast, so we tried their dinner late night. I asked for a different cheese on my sandwich and the server said they can't melt it only put it on the side. Not sure what that was about I've worked in a restaurant for seven years, but was too tired to argue. Portions may be huge but if you're going for a good dinner, go somewhere else.  I still would come here for breakfast any day."
467,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm so glad I got a chance to try this place out!  After 1 week, I'm still thinking about the breakfast here!  

Of the 4 of us, we shared 2 of the Andy's Sage fried chicken benedict, perfect portion & it was delish!!  Do not try to eat one on your own!  It's huge!!  I loved all the fresh flavors of the benedict, its a great twist on the usual benedict flavors and textures.  I loved more of the veggies & biscuits instead of muffins.  Everything went so well together.  The chipotle cream that topped the huge mound was yummilicious!!  I wanted a jacuzi size pot to jump in!  The menu states this plate is a Man vs. Food Fave.  I concur!!

The location is on the 2nd floor of the casino inside Imperial Palace (currently getting a total makeover).  

The service was good for the most part, but our server was inconsisant where he would be so friendly one moment, and kinda grouchy the next.

I would definitely come again and again to try out the other items.  Next on the list is the chicken & waffles!!  That thing is huge!!!  The prices here are very reasonable for the portion and flavors."
468,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Promised to write this review after the impeccable customer service received from Luisa. Just WOW. The wait is definitely worth it for the food but if you want to feel like you're the only people in the whole restaurant, ask for Luisa. I visited on July 5 and it was the best customer service I've ever received. She was so kind and welcoming and provided her undivided attention with nothing but a smile on her face! If I ever return to the Linq, I'd only come for this restaurant and her service!"
469,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food and service.  Potions are huge so be ready to share or come really hungry.  They also have a 25 oz beer with a side of bacon as a menu item lol.
470,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Tip: show up early!!!!!!  The largest pancake I have ever seen. No microwaves here. Everything is fresh. Food arrives in huge black skillet. Delicious. If you are in Vegas, do not pass up Hash House."
471,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and service.

But I beg you, split your meal with your mate!   Portions are huge."
472,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Awesome ambience, food has great presentation and huge portions. For breakfast come early lines get pretty big and if you come too late you might not get in till dinner since they do stop sitting people at one point. You cannot make reservation at this place till after 3pm. If you can't figure out what to eat try different plates and share. There is so much food me and my husband have come and just order one plate for both of us.. Fried Green Tomatoes are delicious and a great starter. Blue Crab cakes ware just okay for me. For dinner the Andy's pork tenderloin comes with horseradish mash potatoes (I always ask for the horseradish on the side) its delicious. But the Sage Chicken and Waffles are a must for first timers."
473,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came on a Thursday early afternoon around 11ish and it was packed with a long waiting list. Luckily 3 bar seats opened up for first come first serve and we jumped on it. So we only waited 5 minutes to be seated. Ordered the chicken and mashed potatoes. The portions are humongous. The potatoes were bomb. The chicken was okay, its white meat if you like that. But they drizzled something sweet on my chicken like syrup?? No idea, but I wasn't a fan. Next time I'd want to try their chicken pot pie."
474,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow! HUGE portions! I felt bad not being able to eat it all, it was sooo good!  I had the French Toast and I was in heaven. My friend had a burger which was out of this world. Their alcoholic drinks are yummy too!"
475,Hash House A Go Go,4,This branch of the chain lives up to its name in every respect.  The menu is fantastic. Service is fantastic. Great location if you're a tourist staying on the Strip. Consider peak hours for breakfast and understand there's going to be quite a wait for a table.  Bring your appetite beacause to serving portions are absurd.
476,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service 2
Food 3
Overall: 2.5

TLDR: Took forever to get our food, food forgotten, ignored. Decent food but not for the price.

We waited 35+ minutes for food, then one of our plates was forgotten. Waited another 5-10 for it to show up.  Mostly ignored overall during our meal. Checks took forever as well.

The food was decent enough.  Massive portions. Many other options around."
477,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A local favorite huge portions. We had the rosemary chicken strips and chicken caesar salad and they were awesome,"
478,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've always wanted to try this place and finally did. I ordered the cast iron skillet cornbread, which was good, then I had their smoked salmon hash which was just okay. My fiancÃ© had a salmon burger which he said was pretty good and the portion was huge!
Although, I didn't feel the welcoming vibe as we walked up to the front. There were four people at the host stand and they were all just too busy doing sidework and chitchatting with each other but hey, we were fed in a timely manner so whatever and our server was nice and attentive. I should've tried one of their humongous burgers but there's always next time. I'll come back and give it another shot next time I'm in town."
479,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was in the mood for comfort food. They have on their menu chicken pot pie. It doesn't get any more comfortable than that! The crust was nothing to speak of, but because I wanted to avoid the carbs, it didn't matter. Plus, the fact that it's basically on the side made it easier to avoid. The chicken was tender and plentiful (I don't know whether it is mentioned in other reviews, but the portions here are enormous). There was a mix of white and dark meat. Tons of veggies and I ordered without mushrooms, which didn't detract from the flavor at all. They also have a warm spinach salad, another favorite of mine. We sat at the bar, so service was good, and they have a cappuccino machine right there. That's a rarity for bars in this town, and they know how to use it! 
Overall, if you're coming here for breakfast or lunch, the menu has a pretty large selection. I recommend splitting entrees, because they are so huge."
480,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love, love, love this place!
It is my favorite brunch place in Vegas, oh, how i wish they had a location here where I live. 
Anyway, my usual is the chicken eggs Benedict but, this time around i think i have become converted to their chicken and waffles which is my bfs usual... either way, i don't think you can go wrong with what you order and the service is always great. 
That is why this is a must go to place when we visit Vegas."
481,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is wonderful on a weekday when  there is no wait. I love the bar, I love the mimosas with quality champagne, the menu is expansive, and the food is all just excellent. I think my favorite meal is the French toast. The biggest draw is the plate sizes... of course I probably didn't have to say that since this place is popular, however they are remarkably large. Great to bring visitors here just for the shock and awe in regards to presentation."
482,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Open 24 hours, this is probably the best deal on the strip.  Depending on your appetite, you can easily feed 2 with one meal, and if I recall, the price wasn't that bad.  And the food was really good.  Sage waffles and chicken has already been brought up in several interviews, and it's definitely deserving of the praise.  Plus, seating isn't THAT bad.  For the strip, it's a great, great deal."
483,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The amount of food they give is insane! We had 8 people in my group, so we waited for about an hour to get seated on a Friday afternoon. They did tell us that it was going to be a long wait, so we weren't upset since we had expected it considering all of their great reviews.

Our group was split into 2 tables, and I was with 3 of my other friends. We decided to order 3 plates to share. We ordered the The Big O' Sage Fried Chicken & Waffle Tower, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit, and a chorizo dish that the server had recommended.

The chicken was cooked deliciously, and extremely crispy! We had to dip it in some ketcup for a little more flavor. However, I loved that their biscuits had bacon inside of it. Their waffles were made really good as well as their bacon mashed potatoes. Unfortunately, the 4 of us could barely get through 2 plates because they gave us SO much food. One plate is really enough to share between 2 people.

I do recommend coming here on a day that's less busy. They give out GENEROUS amounts of food. Definitely worth the money!"
484,Hash House A Go Go,5,Absolutely delicious! Great deal and LOTS of food. Definitely can share a meal and both be full. I had the safe infused chicken and waffles and my taste buds were dancing! I can't wait to go back
485,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go...one of the best values on the Strip! 

Speaking of which, to my surprise there was a HHAGG Location inthe Imperial Palace!!! I was pumped when I found out, cause I was staying next store at the Flamingo! 

So, speaking of the Imperial Palace, I would never step foot in this place if it wasn't for the HHAGG. I didn't know what to expect when I heard the restaurant was in this hotel. 

But........ 

Boy was I surprised! HHAGG was a Gem in the hotel. What a awesome job with the restaurant! Very pleased. 

Important!!! Please READ! 
Breakfast from like 830 am-11am was rocking! Anywhere from 30min to an hour wait! We stopped back around 11:30/11:45 and we were seated right away and I was able to get breakfast food still (limited menu) 

I ended up getting the The Tractor Driver Combo 
Two Eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 HH signature flapjack. Make it a waffle or french toast for a buck. $13.95 
Ame some value!! I will be back again!"
486,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Located inside the LINQ, Hash House A Go Go is the perfect spot to get your breakfast fix along with other great food choices. In addition they also have a drink menu for those who are thirsty. The first time I tried Hash House was 15 years ago at the original San Diego location in Hillcrest. Come get full and be prepared to split the items as portions are huge.~

-AMAZING Sage Fried Chicken Benedict!.. huge and mouthwatering ;)
-Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade= LOVE!!...  Pretty to look at and fab to sip on..
-Open 24/7
-Server was *genuine* when being honest that the order was large enough to share for 3 when I inquired on ordering another additional entree.. 
-Server was also super slow at times and spacey o.O
-Service was 3 stars.. but at least food and drinks were a 5"
487,Hash House A Go Go,5,A must visit especially late night. Open 24/7 and you have to work to find something to complain about when it comes to the food. The wait can get long but it's worth it.
488,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love the food! The chicken and waffle is amazing! The bacon infused inside of the waffle gives the most amazing flavor! I am definitely a fan!
489,Hash House A Go Go,5,"i've been to hash house a go go in san diego and loved it...  told my boyfriend about it when we were in vegas so we stopped there for brunch. it was just as good as i remembered! hash house a go go is a must if you're in vegas or in san diego!! the fried chicken is so crispy, tender and juicy! the corn beef hash, which is what my boyfriend had, is not your typical salty hash...it's full of flavor and seasoned to perfection! don't forget to try the homemade jam too! you can't go wrong with this place!"
490,Hash House A Go Go,4,Staying Vegas and looking to fill your belly with some good homemade food? This is the place. Huge portions. The chorizo jalapeÃ±o hash and eggs was awesome. The biscuits are home made and as big as your face. Highly recommend if your hungry. Consider splitting a meal. You won't want to carry around leftovers.
491,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow try the man vs food Benedict, just a suggestion you might want it to share because it is a monster size serving.
 My husband order the man vs food Benedict and I ordered the pub crawl sandwich( pastrami with caramelized onions and mustard). I almost didn't get it because I like sauerkraut with my pastrami and I am not big on rye. I am glad I gave this sandwich a chance, the rye was not over powering in taste just a light flavor and the mustard and caramelized onions with the sauerkraut made for a delightful change.
I must admit I am surprised they only have a four star rating because the food, service and cleanliness was out of this world.
 One last note a special thanks to our server Amanda who was supposed to be off but had to stay and wait on us all the while bringing cheer and a smile! Outstanding! Thank you so much!"
492,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our server is awesome quick and effective!! If you want to eat here you definitely have to wait or be at least a platinum total reward member but worth the wait!!
As soon as we got seated we were asked about our drink orders. Our server offered to specialize our drink order as close to what we wanted even though our drink wasn't on the menu!! It felt as if we were his exclusive diners thank you Gary for making our first experience memorable!!"
493,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My friends and I tried the chicken and waffles, man vs. food combo, fried chicken salad, and steak and eggs..the portions are huge.. fried chicken happens to be my fave but it tastes horrible here...It's dry and flavorless. Very disappointing. The drinks were not that great either. The waffles and steak were good."
494,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Nice but overrated place - you really have to get here early or bring some time - because there's almost always a long line.
The guy who was taking care of us was really friendly and funny ... he made us feel like we were regulars.
The food on the other hand was ok ... nothing I haven't had better in the US ... but also not bad .... way too much.
I would go again if someone asked me to join."
495,Hash House A Go Go,4,The portions here are ridiculously big definitely for sharing I ate twice first time I had the oatmeal delicious best oatmeal I've ever had second day I had the salmon and I could only eat half of it also delicious good place to have breakfast and not have to worry about eating again until dinner time.
496,Hash House A Go Go,2,Honestly this place was gross. I had the buttermilk pancake with eggs and bacon. My husband had the chicken and waffles. I think the hype of this place is that everything is so big. The wait was 40 minutes for a table for two. If you have a bigger party it's possibly longer. I think everything had a funny taste to it. I would rather have a smaller favorable portion then something so big that there is no way someone can finish. The amounts of food that goes to waste is outrageous. I guess if you are drunk you won't know the difference.
497,Hash House A Go Go,3,"4 stars for the food, 2.5 stars for the service. 

Hash House A Go Go is located inside the LINQ Hotel, which was a bit of a hike from where my boyfriend and I were staying, but we are huge breakfast lovers and thus had to stop by. 

By the time we arrived at around 11:30 AM, the wait for 2 was already up to 1.5 hours. Luckily, we were able to entertain ourselves at the tables. The pub inside the LINQ is also a lot of fun and offers beer pong, if you're looking to kill time with a large group. There's also a Kitson just next door which is fun for browsing for unique gifts.

The wait ended up only being 1 hour - fortunately we decided to head back to Hash House earlier than our quoted wait time and our number was called within 5 minutes... so be aware! 

The menu is very reasonably priced considering the portions are HUGE. If you order the specialty chicken and waffles, be prepared to eat that for several meals or make the smarter decision to share. The pancakes are 14 inches across in diameter... my boyfriend and I could barely finish off half of one, but we did also each get our own entrees. 

After placing our orders, it took approx. 30 minutes to get our food, which is frankly a little ridiculous for breakfast food.... even at a busy place. When the food did finally arrive, it looked and tasted delicious! I ordered ""The Basic"" which is your standard breakfast spread of farm potatoes, scrambled eggs, and your choice of meat. The eggs were perfectly cooked and, again, everything was well-portioned. 

Wait time aside, Hash House is a great choice for breakfast and worth a stop by when in Vegas!"
498,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First of all, you should make a reservation, it will cut down on the LONG wait time for a table.  It gets very busy so be prepared.  It is also a little confusing to find, so make sure you go inside the casino and use the signs.  We walked around outside for a few minutes before realizing that the restaurant was inside.  

Our waiter was Jose, and although very busy he did a great job taking care of us and explaining the huge menu.  All the rest of the staff seemed very busy too and there were a lot of customers to take care of.  

We ordered the Tractor Driver Combo, the Chicken Fried Steak, and coffees.  Both portions were large and we could have probably shared one meal and still be stuffed.  The food was good but not great, but we did enjoy the coffee.  The menu is huge so expect to take some time looking it over. 

The prices are good and so was the food, so we do suggest making this one of your stops."
499,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Working up an appetite in Vegas isn't difficult. Every destination is a hike a freak show. Trekking over bridges, through smoky casinos, dodging flippers and panhandlers as we weave our way through topless performers, Elvi, street people, buskers, and an imitation Pee-wee Herman on his X-1.

From the Bellagio lobby to Hash House A Go Go: Round the lake, through shops, over a bridge to Caesar's, another bridge walkway (over Las Vegas Blvd) by Ballys, through Flamingo, crossing a driveway into the Link Resort Casino where Hash House A Go Go is located. Along the way expect moving and dead escalators which are perfectly suited for photographers.

Consort here. You might ask why I've interrupted Dinner Slut (DS) in her review of Hash House. It's because I am a huge fan of this restaurant--its twisted farm food cuisine and the renown as-seen-on-TV specialties. And, (DS), a petite night person, not an admirer of giant breakfast portions, came along to moderate my calorie intake.

I'm a Hash House fanboy since it opened. A quick history links it to Imperial Palace, a dump, the Quad for such a few heartbeats that I missed that iteration entirely, to the renovated, all modern and upscale, and renamed Linq--the restaurant with its hip Indiana farm ambiance finally has a home that stands as an equal.

At the back of the casino, up an escalator--an overflowing crowd waits to be seated. This is Hash House--packed for breakfast and brunch. (dinner is typically a shorter wait). No rookie, I weaseled our way through the throng (huge both in quantity and individual size), lorded my VIP status at the desk and we were escorted to a table without delay. It's good to be Consort.

We started our noon-time breakfast with Fiji water to dilute the effects of Friday evening, then DS ordered herbal tea and I called for the famous 20 oz HH BLT Bloody Mary (hold the T - tomato allergy). The Mary is served with the usual accoutrements plus two slices of crisp bacon and a side of toast. A meal in itself if you're inclined to dine on huge bar drinks.

DS ordered the regular-sized Farm Scramble with smoked bacon, avocado, onion, and swiss mix-ins. Plated with crispy potatoes, fresh fruit garnish and Hash House's huge buttermilk biscuit. She was pleased with all of the breakfast goodness placed in front of her. Then my order came and her jaw dropped.

Having sampled most of the menu on previous visits, including the mountainous Chicken and Bacon Waffle Tower and the Man V Food favorite Fried Chicken Benedict, I had selected the huge Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict. About as akin to the usual eggs Benedict as a minnow is to a whale--gargantuan. Start at the bottom of the platter with a mound of griddled mash, then add one of the giant HH biscuits split in two and pile on a scoop of spinach. Normally a tomato slice goes here but not so much for me - see allergy reference above. Now take a pound or so of pork tenderloin and pound it flat until it resembles the sole on Bigfoot's sandal, bread it and fry it until it's crispy, tender and down-on-the-farm tasty and lay it on top. Add three scrambled eggs, a slathering of 'bar b' que' cream and a few other odds and ends, like strands of deep fried spaghetti.

""You're never going to eat all that!"" DS teased (of course, she was right). Looking around, we saw monstrous platters delivered to tables, booths, and bar. First they were photographed, then pointed to in disbelief, and eagerly devoured. Some diners left with grocery-sized doggie bags, but, in most cases, plates were cleared with much less in the way of leftovers than one might imagine. Hash House serves a foodgasm that rocked you.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I know I'll head back to H H. I'll order the Chicken Pot Pie that our server said had to be brought to the table by itself because he couldn't lift anything else at the same time. It will be worth the wait.

She is the DinnerSlut"
500,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love this place, we knew they had large portions and were prepared. Everyone ordered and I asked for a plate to pick off everyone. Lol. If you never been they specialize in giving you breakfast and lunch on one plate. The meatloaf was the best meatloaf I've ever had and we had people who didn't like meatloaf, liked theirs. Everything is good here. Bring your appetite and since it's on the strip, it's pricier than your average breakfast place, but so worth it!"
501,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Worth the wait! Yes, you will wait like an hour to get in but it's worth it. They always over quote though, both times I've been they said an hour and 15 and we were seated in 45 min. Watermelon drink = AMAZING. A.Maze.Ing. Their smores mocha also absolutely fantastic. Portions are HUGE, biscuits are very yummy. The fried chicken benedict was bomb. This is a Vegas Must Do. Bring a huge appetite and split meals with people, you will be glad you did."
502,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Dang. I keep tryin'a leave Indiana and here it goes and follows me all the way to the other side of the country. AREYOUKIDDINGME?

On a recent trip to Las Vegas, each of the three of us was supposed to pick a restaurant to for sure visit. My sweetie's choice was this one. I am not a huge fan of breakfast places, but he loves them.

I was pleasantly surprised! The menu was actually a bit more interesting than the standard bacon, grease, eggs, grease, pancakes, grease . . . and grease, which is a snapshot of what breakfast venues typically offer.

I took a chance on the Tractor Driver Combo with Griddled French toast, which is basically a thick french toast with pecans and banana, and some sort of cinnamon cream sauce. Can you say delectable? Since it was a combo, it also came with bacon and eggs. 

Initially, I was put off by the prices, but once the food came, the cost was justifiable. Two people could share a plate, easily. L'il skinny women who don't eat like me and my midwest-farm-girl sisters might even be able to share it between three people. My beefy man and typically ravenous teen did not come close to finishing; I think I did better than both of them.

My knee-jerk reaction was to give this place a 4, but since I am not impressed by breakfast joints and this one was impressive, I'll compare apples to apples (pancakes to pancakes?) and give it a solid 5.

So, yeah . . . I guess leaving Indiana and still finding a bit of Indiana way over there wasn't such a bad thing after all.

P.S. Great waiter! Wish I remembered his name."
503,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is just....ugh. I can't. You must go. I am practically a Vegas native and I still foam at the mouth at the mention of brunch plans here. 

Go fool and stop wasting time reading these reviews!"
504,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Oh man, what they say about this place is true- it's most def COMFORT FOOD!

I think they call it farm food, on the menu. Farm food with a twist, that is.

I had one of the egg scramble dishes and it was super delicious. Very filling. Had to save the other half for lunch.

The eggs benedict were good also, I'd probably order that next time. There was a fried chicken & waffle dish that had bacon INSIDE the waffle. Talk about eating well.

This was upstairs, inside the new LYNC hotel in Vegas."
505,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My review might have been higher, but I was in a rush that morning and didn't really get to enjoy myself.

FOOD:
There was a lot of tempting things on the menu, but I went with one of the Benedicts, which featured sage fried chicken, scrambled eggs, potatoes, griddled mozzarella, and a chipotle cream sauce. This was very tasty, and also more than enough food, I couldn't finish it. Though the chicken didn't have a strong sage flavor, it was crispy and juicy. The griddled mozzarella was a stand-out ingredient.

SERVICE:
Friendly and attentive.

DRINKS:
I hope that the next time I'm here I can sit, stay a while, and try an alcoholic beverage from their full bar.

ATMOSPHERE:
I'd call it an up-scale diner.

PRICE:
It might seem a little high, but when you factor in the amount of food, and the uniqueness of the menu items, it pencils out."
506,Hash House A Go Go,5,Shared the chicken & waffles with fried leeks and sage as well as the fried green tomatoes. Unbelievable. We were visiting for a conference and basically paid for overpriced pathetic food all week. And then HASH HOUSE. Go. Wait in line. Eat at the bar. DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO IN ORDER TO EAT HERE.
507,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG we love eating here! You arrive at the location by taking the escalator from the casino floor - I love this restaurant, we drool every time we see pictures on FB and always make it a point to visit. I signed up online and was able to get a free buy one get one dinner coupon which made it SUPER nice and cheap :)

I ended up ordering the chicken and waffle - they stack it and stab a knife in it, it must be a foot tall with fried leeks - YUM. What can i say - it tastes good, it looks good and it's humungous. You probably could share but why? lol - especially with a buy 1 get 1 coupon. I want to say hubby got some friend chicken benedict thingy and let me tell you - it was slathered in the best hollandaise - SO YUM. The flavors are great for Vegas - you can tell they put time and effort creating a wonderful delicious twisted farm food :)  We absolutely will be going back. These big platters run about $14-$18 a plate - but they are well worth it - if you don't have anywhere to take the left overs - share - there's MORE than enough :)"
508,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The menu is really limited. If you don't eat meat you get to choose between breakfast foods or a salad, which sucks. But the food is awesome!! I got a house salad and it was very fresh and the vinaigrette dressing is really good. The service was great and the restaurant is very comfortable and well lit."
509,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome as always. Bring an appetite!
510,Hash House A Go Go,5,"MASSIVE PORTIONS! Chicken and Waffles are amazing. 4 bacon-y waffles, 2 tender tender chicken breasts. YUM. 

Second time here. It's a Vegas tradition. The wait is about 35 minutes on average, so be prepared to wait. If waiting is not your thing, don't go."
511,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the best breakfast spot on the strip!  The potions are HUGE. I'm a big eater and my wife and I could share the chicken and waffles. Biscuits and gravy is good too.  We had a large party, but the service great.  We know that large parties can be difficult to please.  Scott ( young red head guy) was EXCELLENT! He even checked on us the next day even though we weren't sitting in his section.  If you come to Vegas you have to eat here!"
512,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love the hash house!  Been there 4 times--4 meals all great.  Bring an appetite!  Wife and I had scrambles--chicken is beeeeesssst.  But her friend had a snickers flappyjack it was boomtastic
513,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just had the chicken & waffles, man it was delicious!  Portions are massive. Our waitress was great, service was on point! We had ribs as an appetizer as well, and they were very moist. The fried chicken with the waffles was seasoned perfectly & through chicken was moist. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some great comfort food in Vegas!"
514,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Simply amazing we had the world renown chicken and waffle, fried chicken Benedict and the tractor pancake and my goodness it was amazing and such huge portions. Man vs food was not lying about this place being amazing."
515,Hash House A Go Go,5,Don't be scared of the crowd waiting for tables it goes quick. We waited about 30mins on a Saturday morning. And it was definitely worth it. The food is delicious and the service is great too. We ordered a scramble with crispy potatoes and a chicken waffles. Topped off with grapefruit juice (fresh) and a s'more mocha. Everything was fantastic. The prices are good to for Vegas. We will be back.
516,Hash House A Go Go,3,The food is great! The host is great at the front with directing the people and making the wait limited. My server was horrible tho. I had to wait atleast 5 minutes for everything I asked for. I was at a table w just my friend and I - and when he asked for a water he didn't ask me if I wanted one and moved so fast that he ran after my friend ordered. I'm in the industry myself and I would never leave my table without asking if everyone was okay! Really not impressed by him
517,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had their man vs. food special, and it was great! They give you a ton of food for about $15.

The chicken was soft and juicy on the inside, while crunchy on the outside. The chipotle ranch takes the whole thing to a completely different level.

I will try to eat here everytime I visit Vegas."
518,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This breakfast is gonna last you alllllll day in Vegas because it's supersized! I mean, holy crap is it a large portion. I realize they have a ""man vs food"" item, but honestly, it could all be ""stomach vs food"" entrees. 

But the real test is, is it good? And I can happily say it is! Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because my main entree wasn't my favorite. But let me explain. Not realizing how large the portions were, I ordered the salmon and cream cheese hash, with me and my mom splitting the brown sugar and banana pancakes. To be honest, I really wanted the pancake, but I always feel guilty not getting a little protein in my meal. So I went with the ""healthy"" (I know, it's laughable) salmon dish. 

The salmon was a bit dry and I didn't really like the whole mix of salmon, cream cheese and hash. My mom ordered the mushroom hash, which I, of course, tried. It was much better! But the pancake was AWESOME! I should have just sucked up my pride and just ordered that. It's honestly one massive pancake, that would have equaled three medium sized ones. It was one of the best I've ever had! 

I liked the fact that while you waited they have a sole bar dedicated to bloody mary's! And they are gooooood! I swear, I'd come up there just to get a bloody mary and head back down and go about my day. It was one of the best I've ever had, packed with olives, pickles and a bean! Plus, it was the right amount of spice. 

Speaking of waiting. You will wait. And wait. And Wait. We waited an hour to sit and then another hour for food. We came around 10am on a Sunday, which I'm sure is prime brunch time. I'd highly suggest going in later, but you'll probably always have a wait here. It was worth it though!"
519,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Would I have preferred to go to the original location? Of course. Was I disappointed with this new location inside Imperial Palace? Absolutely not. 

We had a very reasonable 10 minute wait for 4 people. I'm sure we just got lucky to have it that quick but, the host seemed efficient and the place is huge so yous probably have to be pretty un-lucky to have a major long wait at this location. 

Service was very good and friendly. 

Food was good and really fun just to look at. A little on the cool side for me but, whatever. 

Don't hesitate to try this place out for yourself!"
520,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yum! We had this on our last breakfast before we headed out of town. What a stop! Plate sized pancakes. Mashed potatoes for breakfast! We sat at the bar and had a great meal!! We did valet and we were in and out. A definite must on our next trip!
521,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent choice for breakfast.  Went with the fried chicken Benedict and it was aweesome!!!  It's huge so you could easily share this as one meal.  It was on Man vs Food so you know it's good.  Just try it as its really different.   Service was the best as well.  Highly recommend checking this place out if you want breakfast in Vegas.  Another nice thing is its open 24 hours a day so I would go for breakfast hours as I think at night this would be the perfect drunk food.
522,Hash House A Go Go,1,All hype. Ordered the eggs Benedict and there was one tiny egg. Half of the meal was mashed potatoes and half the meal was biscuits and that was it. Go find somewhere else to eat you will regret eating here
523,Hash House A Go Go,3,"GREAT service, GOOD food, MEDIOCRE cocktail (bloody mary's are premixed, supposedly every morning, but it was super watery). 

We had the popular Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Stuffed Waffles, and ordered a side of eggs & a homemade biscuit. 

Hubby loved it, I thought it was just good.  They do have AMAZING  tasting syrup, haha, yeah that stood out to me, weird but true :)

Would go back, but personally I'd try a benedict or omelet next time."
524,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is AMAZING!!!!  Customer service was EXCELLENT. The food DELISH!!!  Portion sizes MORE THAN A MEAL!!!! A return visit is in order.
525,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Everyone is really friendly here.  The service was decent even though the restaurant was packed on a weekend morning.  

I can understand the appeal of a restaurant like this, but I just can't say that I enjoyed my meal.  I ordered the corned beef house hash and was thoroughly disappointed.  It's not a normal corned beef hash in the traditional sense.  There are no crunchy bits as the corned beef is baked then shredded.  

For the first time in my life, I wasn't able to finish even a third of my meal.  I took the meal back to my hotel room  hoping to have another stab at it later, but just the thought of trying made me cringe."
526,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great first meal here, but I'm going back. This is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas.   The service and food were both excellent.  Prices were very reasonable.  Portions were huge.   The fried chicken and waffles was fantastic. They serve pbr in brown paper bags, a nice touch. I loved this place. This is how a restaurant is supposed to be run.  Jason was the best waiter in recent memory. Management, give this worker kudos, he's doing you right.   Everyone in here was in a great mood, this is feel good comfort food at its best!"
527,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is the best breakfast place in Vegas! We tried to go several times but there was a long wait so make sure to plan ahead. The portions here are simply huge! You could easily share an entree between 2 people. I got the apple cinnamon pancake ($11) and it was not only delicious but also the size of a medium pizza. I could only finish about half. My fiancÃ© had the chicken and waffles ($20) and thought it was great. I also had the electric lemonade ($9). Highly recommended!
528,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Seriously giant burgers - definitely the largest I've ever seen. Two thin-yet-half-pound patties, each the size of a dinner plate.  Way more than I wanted, even if it tasted good (which it didn't).  But for under $9, it was a surprising deal.  But that's not a good-enough reason for me to eat here again."
529,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place was packed with people when BF and I arrived around noon on a Friday. We waited about an hour to get seated. I ordered the corned beef, red onions, and Swiss cheese house hash ($13.95). BF ordered Andy's sage fried chicken and waffles ($16.95). BF originally wanted eggs Benedict, but saw that it was served over a biscuit and not an English muffin, so he opted for the chicken and waffles. After we placed our order, the waiter gave us a heads-up that it will take about 30 minutes for our food to come. We weren't particularly in a hurry, but we were hungry and a bit tired of waiting.

My order came first and it consisted of crispy potatoes with corned beef and melted Swiss cheese, two eggs, a biscuit the size of my fist, and a slice of watermelon and orange.

BF's order came and it consisted of two pieces of chicken, four bacon waffles, and fried leeks. Both the chicken and waffles were a bit dry, which was disappointing. 

Overall, the food was tasty (but not amazing), and the portions were pretty big. We (mainly BF) managed to finish everything except for the biscuit. At the end, BF and I said we could have shared the chicken and waffles and gotten a smaller dish instead of another full entree.

We left feeling very full, but would probably not go back due to the wait and ok-taste/price of the food. This place accepts payment by Total Reward Credits which we did and so the tax was knocked off."
530,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions, yummy food, great recommendations from out server, Travis. We arrived around 3pm on a Friday and had no wait, but returned on Saturday and it was PACKED! Would definitely go back during the week between meal times to avoid the wait again. It deserves all the hype!"
531,Hash House A Go Go,3,This place was good. Defiantly could share food. The wait for our food was a bit long.
532,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you like sizable portions of tasty great food and don't want to break your gambling budget, please check this place out. The menu is kinda farm-style home cooked delectable goodness on steroids. I stayed at the LINQ for 5days and ate here at least once a day, btw I think it's open 24/7."
533,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wellllll, THIS PLACE IS NUTS. Seriously, those portion sizes? Phenomenal, massive, wasteful, absurd, delicious. I've been here a handful of times & have always ordered the same thing - the chicken & waffles, naturally. 

Actually, this seems not to be on their menu anymore, based on their website, which is devastating. I hope I'm wrong about it. Their sage-fried chicken is some of the crispiest, juiciest, most flavorful fried chicken I've ever had, & their servers have always been kind enough to let me order it with two boneless chicken breasts instead of a bone-in whatever-other-part they usually serve. The waffle is HUGE & fluffy, with bacon baked into it, right in the batter. Together, topped with real maple syrup, they are a symphony of deliciousness. No joke. No exaggeration. This was the first place I ever ate chicken & waffles, & it's basically ruined me on any other chicken & waffles forever. 

Atmosphere-wise, it feels like a standard Vegas place, fairly inelegant with that harsh Vegas lighting you get in all their hotel restaurants. It feels like, well, a chain - but it's so delicious that who even cares?"
534,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Over priced and the French fries taste like freezer, lettuce for salad hella cheap and old"
535,Hash House A Go Go,1,Ewww found three fingernails in my eggs. When I asked for a new plate they acted like I was completely unreasonable. Do you even know how to breakfast? Insanity.
536,Hash House A Go Go,1,"OVERRATED!! OVERPRICED!! We went to this place based on the reviews read here. I don't know what people are thinking reviewing this place so well. I think they're just embarrassed they spent so much money for such abysmal food. We went for brunch. The drinks were good although extremely overpriced (but what can one expect in Vegas). But the food just wasted good. Everyone in our group was let down. Yes the portions are ridiculously huge, but who wants a large portion of food that doesn't tastes good? I honestly think people are saying they had a good experience because they got caught up in the atmosphere and want to say they had a great time to save face. Wish people would be more honest and tell others how overrated this place is. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
537,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went for Brunch on my short stay in Vegas for a wedding. Had the highly favored Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Not a fan of sangrias, but they offer supposed great ones for $5 while you wait for your table by the hostess. Would definitely go back again!"
538,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here a few weeks ago, portions are no joke. Everything was amazing!"
539,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great place for breakfast.. bring an appetite because the servings are huge... pancakes the size of hub caps...
540,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Good breakfast food in huge portions at reasonable (for Vegas) prices.

Had the bacon waffle with a side of eggs.  This is a huge waffle with strips of bacon laid on the diagonals of the waffle.  When you get a bite of bacon, great, when not it's plain waffle.  Not much different than a waffle with a side of bacon.

For a drink, try the Makers Mark and lemonade - it's the bomb.

Waits for this place can run upwards of an hour.  There's a bar that's firct come first served, if your party is just one or two people."
541,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place has MONSTROUS SERVINGS OF FOOD. 

There wasn't too many people there on a sunday morning. 

We ordered the chicken and waffles. That thing was gigantic of a food. There was HUGE pieces of bacon inside the waffles. The chicken was crispy.

The chicken pot pie was ENORMOUS. Even the server stopped and said it is a huge portion. After 45 mins it STILL looked like she didn't even touch it. 

I ordered a simple scramble with avocado, onions and cheese, with their buscuit and potatoes. Their *fresh fruit* was a dinky cantalope and orange piece. So don't expect to go healthy at a place where it's all out calories and fried food. 

Overall, it was good food if you are super hungry and hungover. I would go back for the chicken waffles. 

It's close to old town vegas. Just right across from the downtown strip."
542,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This was our second time to go go. Food was great. 45 min. Wait. Service was poor. There were 4 of us. 2 got our food and we were almost done before they could get the other food out. Had to beg for refill on coffee. Waiter was never around and was just to busy for him to keep up..

Go to Du-pars at the golden gate casino downtown. Best little kept secret in town. Best pancakes in the world, better service at half the price."
543,Hash House A Go Go,4,"There are already a billion reviews on hash house a go go, but I just wanted to come here and say ""GET THE BROWN SUGAR MAPLE PANCAKE"" omg. It's so goodddd. Crispy pieces, not too sweet, nice banana flavor.... and it's Gigantic!!!!! I would come back and just order this! It is a must try. Other items are not bad, but that pancake! 

:)"
544,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One of my favorite places in Vegas. Every time I am in town I hit this spot. The line can get a little cray but it's well worth it and now I plan for it. This is the ultimate hangover cure. I've had a bunch of items on their menu and everything is delicious. My absolute favorite is their chicken and waffles because the chicken is cooked absolutely perfect.

Chocolate chip pancakes were great. Their hash is scrumptious. You can order a tall can of bud light if you wanna keep the booze flowin'. Great for party's small or large. 

Located in the Linq hotel and in a prime location if you ask me. Put your name in and then go gamble. One do the best things about this place is that it's open 24/7. Service is good and staff is very friendly. I look forward to coming back time and time again."
545,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Good ole obesity inducing American food! My husband had the chicken and waffles and I had the chorizo hash! Portions are huge, service and prices are great. We loved it because it's quality and quantity. 

Next time we will try some dinner options. Can't wait to go back, this is a must try in Vegas!"
546,Hash House A Go Go,4,Obviously the portions are HUGE but a great go-to is the banana brown sugar pancake with whipped cream. It is so crunchy and delicious. Not too sweet but just sweet enough.
547,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great find. All the workers around here were raving about this place. Huuge portions for a decent price. Sharing is recommended.
548,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I wish there was one in Seattle!  I ordered the Pot Pie with my fiancÃ© and we couldn't finish it together.  Normally I'm not big on restaurants with schticks of serving huge servings because it's a waste of food, and usually not very tasty.  This food was amazing!  I can still taste the crust and the perfect creamy and savory sauce.  So good!  I'll come back to Vegas just for this place.  We tried coming back for breakfast before our flight but it was packed.  Just means they're that good!"
549,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Usually, there is a wait....don't let that scare you! Portions are large, food is fresh, service is prompt....bloody Mary's are sooooo good!!!!"
550,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The place has a TON of seating and is open 24 hours which is nice. The quad also offers free self parking, which isn't too far away.

Isn't the nicest place in vegas, but it's a decent home style diner type place. 

Huuuuge portions, very hearty food. Expect to leave feeling a little groggy. Prices are reasonable. Open 24 hours which is nice. 

Chicken and waffles are good: it's not as deep fried as most fried chicken, but is lightly breaded, flavored with sage, and crumbles off when you cut it. Yum. The mashed potatoes with cheese and bacon mixed into it is food too."
551,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I usually try to come here every other trip to Vegas since they opened this location on the Strip! 

Is it the best breakfast I've had in Vegas? Not really. Is it abysmally located in the Quad ::shudder:: Casino? Yes. 

But, I've been in 3x now and have heard their other breakfast foods are great, but I only order Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It's just so gawdamn over-the-top, I can't help myself. 

Huge chunks of well-seasoned fried chicken, with a thicker, crisp breading exactly the way I like it, layered on top of a [slightly boring] biscuit, but made exciting again with spinach, mozzarella, tomato, bacon (hold the bacon, please) eggs (it comes with scrambled but I like it with over-easy yolky eggs) and a chipotle cream 'hollandaise' sauce.

All this on top of perfect shredded hashbrowns. Even the embellishments are 'look at me!' too. A huge rosemary sprig out its mountainous top, and what tastes like deep-fried spaghetti noodles sprinkled all over the whole thing. 

The wait can be long depending on when you get there, but the service is always SO FRIENDLY. I think it's because when you look around the dining room, everybody is beaming their fool heads off. Makes for a good working environment :)  

I'll be back in town next month, and even though the last time I was in the chicken itself was a little dry...I'm thinking that I won't be able to help myself."
552,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We came for breakfast. Maybe it was just our server, but she wasn't good. We didn't even get our drinks tell right before the food came. Then when I did get my drink it was a mimosa and not orange juice. So I had to send it back which was a longer wait to get my drink. Once I did the OJ was warm. The food had no flavor. The eggs tasted like something you would get at a fast food place. We really didn't know what all the hype is about this place. Its Vegas, there is so many better places. 
The food portions on the other hand is really big. 2 people could share one plate. Or maybe we just had so much food left over because it wasn't that great."
553,Hash House A Go Go,5,Minus the wait and crowded lobby the food was great!!! I would say this is a must have when in Las Vegas!!!
554,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Everything in Vegas is expensive. This was expensive (per entrÃ©e). BUT, their  portion is GINORMOUS. You get one thing and it can literally feed THREE people. SO, it's really not expensive. We were fatties so each of us order one thing per person and everyone ended up having leftovers that can feed 3 more people. Everything was DELICIOUS. We had the chicken & waffle, chicken penne pasta, and chicken potpie. Overall, food was amazing. We were all super hungry so I might be a little biased on the taste. We got seated pretty quickly but were waiting over 20 minutes before one of us got up to ask the host for water and find our waiter so we can order...! We were HANGRY but once the food came out, everything fell into place (waiter was attentive, food was good, we were fed)."
555,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went with family, portions are huge and food is delicious.  A must go for breakfast when in Vegas.

The pancake is a monster.  I had the hash, it was great - definitely order.

Only problem is the place gets packed, crazy packed. Expert to wait an hour.  It would be great if they put in a system where they txt you when your table is ready do you don't need to stand there waiting. The waiting area is really crowded and it's difficult getting a seat.

I will be back every time I visit Vegas."
556,Hash House A Go Go,3,4 star meal. 3 star service and wait. I'll give it a 3. Was higher but I've had some duds and the tourists keep coming in droves. Screw it.
557,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was mediocre, large quantity if you want a bang for your buck but nothing special. Got the meatloaf sand which and is was kind of a let down. The environment reminded me of a Denny's, so great for people that want to cure their hangover."
558,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had the watermelon kiwi spiked punch with mushroom hash. What was really worth writing home for was the snickers pancake: HUMONGOUS, crispy yet fluffy and melted chocolate with peanuts and syrup really made the meal. 

Attentive service and the wait went fast."
559,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Imperial Palace is nowhere special overall but there is ONE place inside that is worth raving for and it's Hash House A Go Go.

My husband and I got into LV early and had to wait a couple hours for our room. I have heard nothing but great things about the food here (other location is at M Resort off strip) so we decided to check it out. Hostess asked us to wait 20 minutes and exactly 20 minutes later, our table was ready (not bad for a Sunday morning). Music was a tad too loud for me for a restaurant but nothing too major.

Husband ordered the basic breakfast (two eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes). I ordered the corned beef hash breakfast. Both servings were HUGE! The value is unbeatable... great food, big portions, for a decent price. Both of us loved the food. It was warm, tasty, and cooked perfectly. We didn't wait too long for the food, which surprised me considering how packed it was. We both had orange juice and it was freshly squeezed and refreshing. Wait service was good as well.

Be sure to try their homemade jelly. Wow- delicious!

Don't miss this place next time you're in Vegas."
560,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Located on the second floor inside the Imperial Palace casino on the Strip.

We came for an quick bite after catching the Human Nature show.  Our server asked us if it was our first time eating at Hash House.  We said yes.  He warned us that portion size was huge.

Knowing that, we opted for the ""Just Grazing"" section of the menu as it was around 9:30pm.

Hubby got the BBQ pork ribs and I had the fried green tomato stack.  I wished I had taken a picture of my order.  Four slices of cornmeal crusted green tomatoes with goat cheese and chicken breast meat stuffed in the barrel.  And stacked on top of a huge watermelon wedge.  It was very good.  I enjoyed the combo of tomatoes with the chicken breast meat.

Hubby's pork ribs were tangy, tender, and sweet and the meat fell off the bone. Sat on top of some red potatoes.  Good combo too.

Beverages included homemade lemonade and the kiwi strawberry watermelon which was way too sweet."
561,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hungry? Well this place have delicious food and huge portions!! The atmosphere is great and everyone is nice I would definitely come back when I visit Vegas.
562,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food was great...everything else, not so much.

Pros:
- Busy Tuesday morning around 10 am and tons of people but the wait wasn't too long
- Food was good
- Portions are generous (burgers automatically have 2 patties)
 
Cons:
- Felt rushed (our first time and the menu is huge)
- Ordered a burger, the fries were great but the portion was pathetic
- They charge for a side of ranch ($1.29)
- The table we sat at was set for 4, but with all the stuff on it, we could barely fit 2
- We told our waitress we wanted to keep the menu to order more later and before we finished our 1 dish, she already put the check on the table. I felt like she wanted us to leave so we did cause we didn't want to dine/spend our money in that kind of atmosphere.
- Never got a refill for our waters
- We got the #2 burger which is supposed to have jalepeno, pepper jack cheese, and Hungarian wax pepper and neither of us got any spice or hot from our burger."
563,Hash House A Go Go,5,"In just one visit this has easily become my favorite breakfast spot. I had the BLT bloody mary which was absolutely delicious, I think I finished it in one gulp! It was a good size, with a piece of toast, bacon, and lettuce and tomato garnish. Followed by the sage chicken benedict, again absolutely delicious. The portions are huge. I had breakfast and took enough for lunch to go and still did not finish it all. 

This is the best bang for your buck in Vegas. My meal was $19, easily split between 2 people would have been $8/person! You can't get this much food, let alone good food, for $8 at McDonalds!  

Be prepared to wait.. we went on a Sunday morning and it was a 45 minute wait for 2. We were lucky enough to get seats at the bar within 10 minutes. This was fabulous and my boyfriend got to watch football. 

I will make this a MUST STOP in every city with a location."
564,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Got the chicken&waffles + the brown-sugar banana pancakes. The chicken was seasoned and fried to perfection along with the delectable waffle with bacon strips inside. That dish alone can feed two people. The pancakes were humongous as well. They were just alright. The wait for this place is ridiculous and we had to wait 45-50min for our food to come out after we ordered. The server was friendly, but it also took forever for her to come take our order after being seated."
565,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Some stuff is good some blah. Cocktail was great. Staff was the correct amount of attentive. Vegas priced, no complaint with that. If I were to go again, I would probably go to the bar counter and just get cocktails. Food can easily be skipped."
566,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Everything was as I expected from reading reviews. Enormous portions. I wouldn't call it high quality food. Eggs were more brown than yellow which tells me they were probably cooked in bacon grease. Everything tasted delicious, just very unhealthy."
567,Hash House A Go Go,5,Definitely one of the best breakfast I have had.  Get the Chicken and Waffles with one of their Bloddy Mary's!  Definitely will go here every time I'm in Vegas.
568,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I dined here on a Saturday night. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was spiced nicely, but was dry and over cooked. The waffles, however, were delicious with bacon cooked inside them. The waiter made a slight error with my Mom's order, but made up for it with a complimentary side of biscuits. We sampled the salmon and meatloaf along with my chicken and waffles.

This is definitely a fun food place with huge portions presented interestingly, but I thought the taste of everything overall was just average besides the waffles.

Be warned as the restaurant's noise level is very LOUD."
569,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hashhouse is sooooo good! We stayed at the LINQ for our Vegas trip and we wanted something hearty before heading out for the night. We decided to come to HashHouse and order it to-go so we can eat it in our hotel room as we got ready.

Food - 

*Sage Fried chicken with pasta - So hearty and delicious! The skin of the chicken was at its perfect crisp and the pasta was as creamy as it could get! The infamous chicken that everyone must try lived up to it's expectations! This order comes with two big pieces of chicken and it was moist and not a bit of it was dry at all. This dish was two full meals for me. Even my friends who eat a lot, could not finish their food in one sitting since the portions were so generous.

I am definitely coming back next time I visit Vegas. This is a great place for comfort food, drunchies, and even both casual/dressy dinner!"
570,Hash House A Go Go,4,"sage fried chicken and waffles.

there is bacon INSIDE the waffles.

heart attack.

i die."
571,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place always has a wait but it goes by pretty fast.  The portions are big enough to feed the whole family. I love the watermelon lemonade.  I'll defiantly make this place a tradition on every Vegas trip
572,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The service here was great!  The food was even better, though.  It is comfort food, but done so well!  The sage fried chicken tastes like you're biting in to Thanksgiving.  The side of salmon that my friend ordered with her salad was huge and delicious.  It was better prepared than what she had at Craft Restaurant the next day, and it was a fraction of the price.  These people are clear about what they want to deliver and then do it with excellence.  Well done!"
573,Hash House A Go Go,5,Outstanding Bfast spot. Huge portions! Great hangover cure! I recommend sharing the entrees family style.
574,Hash House A Go Go,1,Our waitress told us our order would be ready in 20-30 mins but almost an hour later we did not receive anything. So I asked for a manager because we were on a tight schedule because we had to get ready for my sisters wedding. The waitress came back to our table snapped back that she would have never said 20-30 mins because they are never able get food out that fast. As everyone at our 10 party table reinforced that we all heard the same thing our waitress actually put it on her daughter that she did not say that in the most rude tone I've ever expected. The chicken and waffles was definitely not worth the wait or the attitude we received from our waitress. I was truly disappointed in my experience.
575,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Has House A Go Go makes sin taste so good! 

Being from Indianapolis it was quite interesting to see this ""Twisted Farm Food"", which was every bit of delicious. Granted, we don't really eat like neanderthals in Indy it was perfect. 

My fiance and I both enjoyed the Kiwi Watermelon lemonades - beautifully made with an even better taste. 

Him: My hubby got the rosemary chicken skillet (something like that) which was an absolutely delectable serving of roasted chicken, fried potatoes, egg and turkey bacon. The chicken was perfectly seasoned with flavorful rosemary and paired with perfectly cooked potatoes, being served in a sizzling hot skilled. My hubby is a cop-out and got scrambled eggs (so you can't really mess that up). 

Me: I had a ""Tractor Platter"" with french toast which was perfectly seasoned with egg and cinnamon, and topped with powdered sugar (yum!). The best thing, the french toast wasn't some tiny piece of bread but real Texas toast - this was in turn served with delicious crispy shredded hash browns (cooked to perfection), which for some reason no other restaurant can seem to get hash brown crispy. Kudos to Hash House A Go Go on that. The final part of my dish was fantastic - a serving of fresh fruit, a banana sliced long, and a couple slices of orange. The banana was a great surprise because, they actually threw it on the grill, which was a taste of perfection. It enhanced the sweetness of the banana without completely caramelizing it. (It was so great that my hubby almost lost his finger because he couldn't stop munching on it)

Overall Hash House A Go Go is a definite must while visiting Vegas (I absolutely fell in love with this place) - and will certainly be back on my next trip to Sin City."
576,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Ate here on a Thursday morning with my husband. I'd seen the episode of Man Vs. Food, so naturally we had to try it. 
We didn't have to wait which was nice. 
Travis was our server. Super friendly and provided great service. 
I ordered the butterscotch pop latte and asked for it iced. When it came out, it was luke warm and didn't have a hint of butterscotch at all. Only drank about half of it. My husband ordered the hot chocolate. His was creamy and chocolatey.
I ordered the HH Original eggs Benedict. Mashed potatoes, biscuits, basted eggs, spinach, tomato and bacon topped with a roasted red pepper sauce. It was very esthetically pleasing, being huge and colorful with fried angel hair pasta sticking out if it and huge sprig of rosemary down the middle. Taste wise- meh. The red pepper sauce was virtually flavorless, the eggs were not seasoned, the biscuit was on the dry side. The mashed potatoes that it sat on top of were pretty much the best thing on the plate. There were only two slices of bacon on it also. The sides of the plate were smeared with Siracha. Wish the whole dish had been covered in it! 
My husband ordered eggs, sausage, and the apple cinnamon pancake. The pancake was huge and had at least half an apple worth of Granny Smith slices in it. Definitely better than my flavorless entree! 
All in all, this place seems quite over-rated. Maybe I'll try it again if we make it back to Vegas."
577,Hash House A Go Go,4,The wait was less than stated. The ambiance fun and the food adequate and abundant. Huge portions to share and fair prices plus fun staff. Yummy
578,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Cold eggs that were ""brown"" from being overlooked.  Cold potatoes. The actual skillet the breakfast was served in was cold. Entire experience felt like buffet food being served on a plate. 


On the plus, the service was friendly."
579,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Packed house, weird waiter, great food.

My wife and I went here a year ago and she's been buggin me to go back here for their famous sage fried chicken and waffles.  So we finally went back.

On the way in, I tried to use my stroller up the escalators, but it wouldn't fit. The imperial palace floor manager came over and helped me find the elevator to get up into the hash house.

We sat for about 30 minutes. It was a good wait time. The place was packed at 12:00pm even tho Vegas wasn't.

I had the chicken and eggs Benedict which was labeled man vs. food favorite.

And it was excellent! 
Sage fried chicken and waffles are always good eats and this time wasn't an exception.

The waiter was kinda weird. I asked for a separate check so I could expense it. He didn't understand and even said ""I don't understand why you would split it but I'll do it anyway"". He forgot to split it and I had to ask him again.

The waiter noticed that we were going to use our 2 $10 off from our rewards cards and instead of just leaving the tip up to us (we base the tip off the full price and not the net price after the cards cuz that's jacked up) he made up some wild story about having to have us put the tip on the bill before he used the rewards card.  He said his credit card machine would take forever.  B.S.  Oh well, still tipped him but I can see why he didn't trust his patrons.  Although, I was kinda turned off by it.  - Really do I look that stupid?  Thanks for not answering.

Something to note is the restrooms were downstairs in the casino. So going to the restroom took a while.

Food was excellent, service was okay. 4 stars HH."
580,Hash House A Go Go,1,"What a disappointment.

Yes, I have only heard amazing things about this place, and I'm sure it may be true however, the service I received during my visit completely ruined this experience for me.

I came here early on a weekday night with a party of 4, let's day 9ish. We were sat right away which was great, as I had attempted coming here three different times only to have to turn around due to the ungodly wait times.

So here I am, on cloud 9 finally getting to try all of the amazing things I hear about HH.
30 MINUTES LATER someone finally comes over to take our drink order. Another 20 minutes go by before we receive them. Another 15 minutes before we order and ONE HOUR before the food came out...
I'm sure you can see were I'm going with this.
I am a very reasonable person when it comes to dining out, and as I have been a waitress in the past, I completely know how this thing works.

THIS, was on another level.

As what takes the cake?? MY CHICKEN WAS RAW. 

I don't have words. After waiting over two hours for food, and having raw chicken delivered to my table.... I still don't have words.

The server was very nice and very apologetic and did not charge us for the meal however, It will take a lot for me to try HHAGG again."
581,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Don't pay with a credit card here, unless you are okay with taking the chance of getting your card information stolen. It happened to me, I called management about it, they said they would call back, and never did. This was the only place where my credit card left my hands. Go at your own risk and pay cash."
582,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Curiosity was the major reason for going to the Hash House in Henderson. 

Being a first time patron, I decided to go easy: two eggs, one pancake, potatoes. The eggs and the pancakes were fine, the potatoes were nothing special, in quality and quantity - nothing more then grilled, salt, ... .  

My companion had corn beef hash, potatoes, two eggs potatoes and a biscuit.
1. The hash was made from shredded corn beef: The meat was taste but shredded is not the way it should be used here. This made it  difficult to swallow.
2. The eggs were okay, like min, not extra large.
3. The potatoes, like mine, were nothing special but not burnt.
And 4. The potatoes were, sneak-a-ly, put  under the hash, making the portion look tremendous - fake-out.
5. Finally the biscuit: Large, yes, HEAVY like a rock, yes.  Not appetizing.

The staff were amicable, but very rehearsed: If I heard the word ""tremendous portions""  one more time, I would have left: The manager was explaining the menu to the people in the next booth. ""Tremendous Portions, Made Fresh Daily, Made In-House""
over and over and over again.

The icing on the pancake: $28.00 is too much for a basic breakfast food.

My girlfriend said she had been to the Sahara location before and it was very good. So, I repeat - this was one experience at one location.

I will try again but not real soon.

583,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Expected it to be much better, the food was gross the chicken and the biscuits were cold wasn't happy with this place."
584,Hash House A Go Go,4,Fairly priced and decent home-cooked type of food. Kind of a quirky lil hidden restaurant with interesting plating and friendly staff. They put so much food on the plate it's ridic. I didn't have to wait for service but we prob ate at a weird hour like 10 or something.
585,Hash House A Go Go,1,Large portion of disgusting food. Pancake was bigger than my face but not fluffy at all. I'm really not into large quantity of food that lacks in quality.
586,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We came for the first time from Virginia. Our server Nathaniel was excellent the food was quite horrible . My family of 5 got the famous  chicken and waffles !The plate presentation was beautiful and immaculate but the sage & rosemary was overpowering by the 2nd bite . The breading was soooo thick and you couldn't find the meat at all ! We talked to the manager and he seemed insulted that we even said anything negative about the food . He said ""we were the first people to ever complain"" . He didn't even offer another option,comping anything off,his hospitality was purely distasteful and rude. Our server Nathaniel did everything possible to make our visit better despite the manager not even caring. We will not be returning due to the quality of food but the presentation and ambience was cozy and relaxing."
587,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We visited the location off the strip with some friends while we were vacationing. The biggest thing about this place that got me was the portions!! I could NOT believe how generous the portions are!! I ordered the corned beef hash and the hubs ordered the sage chicken, which were both very very delicious I will say! The hubs and I typically split what we order and share, but man, we were barely able to finish half of what we even ordered ourselves! I thought the decor and attire of the staff was fun, though when we came there was a DJ and I think it was a little loud. Overall though, enjoyed the meal, the place and would come back when I'm in the area again!"
588,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great service and awesome food and atmosphere The Andy's fried chicken,eggs bacon and mashed potatoes with biscuit and gravy is my favorite here."
589,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food is ridiculously large.  Very tasty and strong bloody Mary's. Always has a long wait. Always worth waiting.
590,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Saw in a plane magazine that this was one of the best breakfast restaurants on the Strip and my husband and I decided to give it a try. We had the special of the day, an egg and steak scramble with biscuit. It was a large amount of food and my husband actually said that it intimidated him. It was so good, but we could have shared one breakfast. The price was excellent for the amount of food we got."
591,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Only in sin city can the carbs be soooo good!!! 
We ordered a Snickers pancake and the chicken and waffles. Sweet baby Jesus the waffles made me want to slap somebody they were so good! They were fluffy, needed no syrup and when I bit into it and discovered each bite had crispy pieces of bacon....lawd have mercy it took me to heaven. The chicken was honestly AMAZING!!!! It was juicy, crispy and perfectly seasoned. 
The portions were so huge that we were not even able to eat half the pancake or the waffles...but damnit we tried. 
The server that we had was awesome, and the prices were extremely reasonable.
I will most definitely be back when I'm in the city and I would recommend this as a must, you will not be disappointed!"
592,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Seriously The Best Breakfast in Vegas!! I'm in love with Hash House!! Their hash scrambles and Bloody Mary's are to die for!! 
Love, love this place!'"
593,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions, decent prices, great flavor! We ate here twice on our first visit, everything was delicious! We will be back soon."
594,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This place is a damn joke! My husband and I came here to try it out and see for ourselves if it was worth all the hype, Well it's not! 

Service is horrible (our waitress hates her job) or at least that's how she came off. We waited 10 mins for 2 waters and a coke.... 

10 minutes later came back to see if we were ready to order. Now we're 20 minutes in and been ready. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered The Basic (eggs potatoes fruit biscuit and added ham. 

20 mins later they serve my husband this thing full of all this shivery which were fried onions on top but the chicken was raw!!!! Mind you I'm still waiting for my food. 

He tells the server and she literally responded with ""what do you want me to do"" WOW.....  My husband and I asked for the check and asked to speak to a manager. She explains the manager won't be in til later. 

She brings my plate out and here our some scrambled eggs with bacon when I ordered sunny side up eggs with ham. We wasted $28!!!! Horrible"
595,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants ever. Great service, delicious food, you get to keep the cup as a souvenir  the mocha was delicious. Definitely recommended."
596,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We had a party of 8 and checked in with the hostess after 11am.  Thought it would take at least an hour to get seated with so many people waiting.  But was I wrong!  We got seated in approximately 10 minutes.

Our server was Alonzo.  He took a while to greet us and take our order, but he was great beyond that!  We were stressed out because their signs said that they were no longer serving pancakes, French toast, etc. after 11:30am and it was almost 11:30am when we got our order in.  We got our order in though in time.

Our drinks came right away.  The coffee was good and so was the OJ.  The food came in phases. The sage fried chicken waffle bacon tower with fried leeks took the longest. My friend and I shared that meal since it was such a huge plate of food.  I thought the chicken was nice and crispy, but wished it was tastier.  The waffle bacon was great and the fried leeks were tasty!  The banana brown sugar pancake was ridiculously huge, but was amazing tasting!  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. 

Looking forward to coming back again."
597,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First place we ate in Vegas and man was it excellent! We got the truckers Combo and the basic egg breakfast.

The portions are HUGE! When trying to decide on one pancake or two, the waitress said, ""Oh the pancakes are the size of my tray."" We went with one thinking there was no way it was that big. Oh it was THAT big!

The eggs were cooked so well! The crispy potatoes weren't so good and my toast was demolished by a sprig of herbs...but the service was phenomenal! The fruit was yum! The presentation was excellent! So impressed, definitely coming back!"
598,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Big portions of slightly gourmet comfort food...I found it just ""ok.""

We were looking for a place to eat dinner & we knew we wanted to try Hash House A Go Go...we know it's more famous for the breakfasts but we were not in the mood for breakfast food so we decided on sharing a Caesar salad and a pasta dish with cream sauce, mushrooms and sage fried chicken.

The Caesar was good...hard to mess up though.  They did have parmesan crisps that I liked and instead of croutons, they fried up squares of polenta - the bf was not a fan of that.

The pasta dish wasn't that great...the sauce was entirely too sweet.  The fried chicken was very good though and the two of us were able to finish this easily.  

Service was friendly...there is a full bar so you can drink to your heart's delight.  Overall though, I'm not that impressed - maybe we really need to eat breakfast here instead of I don't know if I want that much pancake going inside my stomach."
599,Hash House A Go Go,4,"OK after having been a HHAGG fan for some time now, my last reviews to OTHER locations had let me down and I had vowed to never return.  Well, this weekend I am glad that we tried this location because they truly redeemed HHAGG for for us.
The food (sage fried chicken benedict, of course) was absolutely amazing. The service was outstanding, everyone here was really busting their butts, yet everyone was in a great mood and very friendly.
My only complaint of this location is the ventilation, I know that it is in a casino but the cigarette smoke is pretty bad.  Kind of makes it hard to enjoy the wonderful food.  :-("
600,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I come here at least once every time I visit Las Vegas. It's a must go if you're visiting for the first time! And especially if you're drunk, hungover, stoned, sober, or hungry, this is the spot for you! The portions are super ridiculous you'll most likely want to share with someone unless you're feeling beastly. Order anything with their fried chicken in it, you won't be disappointed. I also love their presentation where they stab a huge knife right in the middle of your dish with all the garnishes. Super legit! Also if you're trying to drink for cheap they do a tall boy of Budweiser for like 7 bucks. Hopefully this review was helpful towards deciding where your drunk ass wants to eat."
601,Hash House A Go Go,4,Love this place.i  First went to San Diego then when I found out there was one in vegas well here I go.  Always a line.  Bar is small but we always try to get in and dine at the bar. Don't miss out.
602,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I couldn't help but continuously compare this location to the one in Chicago. Mostly because the Chicago location is located in an upbeat and young area, whereas Hash House A Go Go: Nevada is located in Old Vegas, the complete and total opposite of upbeat and young. 

The food was as I expected: gigantic, greasy, delicious, and a good precursor to a night of shenanigans. 

However the service was just depressing. I felt so bad for the hostess and the waitresses. They looked exhausted, overworked, and like they had been in the service business way too long. Our first waitress gave us a hairy water, and when she went on break, our next waitress gave us thumbnail sodas. No, those are not quirky drinks that HHAGG serves, we just had long hair dunked in our waters, and fingers and thumbs used to hold the glasses of soda we ordered. 

HHAGG: Old Vegas is probably a saving grace in its neighborhood, and I don't doubt that there are plenty of employees who enjoy being there, we just didn't get served by them."
603,Hash House A Go Go,5,First time leaving yelp review only because it's worth it here! Never Fails!!! Reno or Las Vegas! I would suggest sharing dishes. Me and group of friends had 3 dishes. To enter and a side salad that filled all 5 of us up.
604,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This spot was a bit tricky to find considering the construction going on outside The Linq.

The wait was not long considering it was EDC weekend. My boyfriend and I were taken by surprise when the food came out, they have very large portions!
The food tasted great, and they even have bacon stuffed waffles

The waiter that served us was very friendly and funny.

It was the first time and we will definitely be returning next time we visit Vegas."
605,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've only been here once, so this is just a review on my one experience. First off, it took a long time to get seated, and even longer to get our food. Probalby about 20 minutes for 4 poeple around 11am to get the table, then almost an hour to get our food. I would like tot hink that their service probably is faster, so we will give them a try because they are cheap for that gigantic amount of food they give you. There is a huge menu and everything tastes pretty good.

Definately give them a try if you are here. I think one of the player card coupon books has a 5 dollar off coupon for them too, so get that first then come here."
606,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Five stars for the food and ambiance, two for the service.  A farm atmosphere is carried as the theme, and it is executed tastefully.  Server Ishii was cool and quick-paced in the beginning, but attitude improved as the meal progressed.  Portions are huge and high priced, including NO free coffee refills!  Waffle, pancake and four coffees were over $40, so be prepared to spend; a little expensive for breakfast, no?  Definitely a one time wonder!  This review is only for breakfast; went back for dinner and would NOT recommend.  Totally disappointed with dinner service and food."
607,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First of all, GREAT service. 

Jason was awesome. The gal that ran our food out to us was even unbelievably nice. 

Be prepared for food coma, not just from quantity but from the taste. This place will rock your taste buds!

Went on a Sunday morning at 10, still got seated in 10 minutes.

Well worth any wait.

Do not miss out on this place!!"
608,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You will NOT leave hungry! 

We arrived on a Saturday morning at 7:15 with very little wait. The line was super long when we left at 8:15. So my advice is to get there early if you want to avoid a wait. 

The food is delicious. They have quite the variety on the menu - including cold cereal! 

I ordered the sun-dried tomato goat cheese scramble and it was outstanding! The hubby got the tractor combo and the pancake was the biggest I've ever seen in my whole life! 

If we lived in Vegas, we'd be here often! Will certainly come back when we get the chance."
609,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you're looking to indulge, look no further. This place does not joke around when it comes to flavor and portion (my two favorite things). My 3 friends and I came for a late lunch on a weekday around 3 pm, and we still waited about 45 min. And boy it was worth every second.

I ordered Andy's sage fried chicken plate with over easy eggs because who can resist runny yolk with fried chicken. Not me. If you have never tried the two together, do yourself this favor. I admit that I have the appetite of a 500 pound man, but this meal defeated me. It's not just the portion that I drool about. The chicken was so crispy and juicy that I looked forward to the next bite. Top off the plate with a biscuit and winner winner chicken dinner.

Vegas is sin city so here's to gluttony."
610,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The attraction here are the huge and impressive platings. You get a lot of food for your money, the taste is decent and the service is good. I especially enjoyed the BLT bloody marys!"
611,Hash House A Go Go,4,I wish I was hungrier when I came.. The portions are huge and sharing two dishes with three people was still too much food. We ordered the Hash House Cobb Salad which I felt would have tasted better without the barbeque sauce. The blue cheese crumbles do make the salad pretty heavy though. We also ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Very fluffy bacon waffles and crispy chicken.
612,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG! Food was amazing!  Highly recommend the sage chicken Benedict, chicken n waffles and banana pancake!  So yummy.. We split these three dishes by four ppl and has plenty!  Big servings!  Oh get a spicy Bloody Mary too!! Yummy breakfast will definitely return!!!!"
613,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was amazing!! We ordered the Bacon Waffles and coffee. Told them we were going to share & I guess because everyone wants to do this due to their huge portions, there is a charge. Now we have been told of the plate charge @ other restaurants which usually means the kitchen portions it out on another plate for you and we just decline that & they forego the charge but not here. But the waiter did suggest how we might as well order a side dish so we are actually getting something for our $2.50 plate charge. We ordered more bacon of course!! I think that was $3.50 but still, it was all well worth it. I ordered tThey were AMAZING!!!! We ate two & took the other two back to our room where we had it the next a.m. as we were getting ready to head out. (we had a microwave). The coffee was great as was the service! The only complaint i have is the hostess. When she gave us the little pager thing, I told her I had to use the restroom. She told me where it was (downstairs) and I asked if the pager would work that far...she said ""yes"" so downstairs we went. Don't worry, the bf held the pager for me so I didn't take it n the bathroom (though I'm sure there are people who do). We got a message on it saying the pager wasn't receiving messages. We had to go back upstairs to get it reset. We still had about 30 mins of a wait so we went downstairs again, but not as far as the bathrooms, to play a few slots & got the same message. So for future reference, the pagers don't work downstairs!"
614,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Good food, huge portions, really friendly staff. Keep coming back here when we're in town. The Sage Chicken Benedict is our favorite. The pancakes are HUGE. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and amazing early in the morning. We'll be back."
615,Hash House A Go Go,1,The late night service I'm receiving is nothing short of lazy and inconvenienced. The staff is impatient and static at best. Ordering food is a burden. If there were someplace better like. Denny's is more attractive than here. The night menu is limited and lazy. Wow. For all the praise this place gets I expect more. So not impressed. Bar staff is functional at best. She opens her own drink first rather than getting you a drink. Not impressive at all. Asked me if I wanted to order. I did. Then she didn't enter it in. Only asking me again what I ordered 5 minutes later. Not my favorite place period.
616,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and they were pretty busy. They said it was going to be about a 30 min wait, but we were seated within 10 minutes. I forgot to catch our waitresses name, but she was super friendly and took great care of us. Chicken & waffles is a HUGE portion. I split it with my brother and we couldn't even finish it. I heard great things about their Bloody Mary's, but I wasn't impressed. I wanted to love it sooo bad, but their mix is boring. The presentation was on point tho. But I've had way better. Prices are ehhhhh okay, not cheap but not expensive. This place is a great place to stop at on your way out of Vegas! I would come back and give one of their classic burgers a try."
617,Hash House A Go Go,4,We have only eaten breakfast here and all portions were big enough for 3 days of breakfast. Last time in vegas had a bunch of comp left on my card so we ordered one of about every pancake on menu. Snickers bar pancake was awesome. Service was good. You have to go here at least once!
618,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Absolutely loved it! While waiting to be seated, we got Bloody Mary's at the makeshift bar. $12 each but worth every penny. Best Bloody Mary ever, they have a significant spicy kick. Once seated our waiter came promptly and was very friendly. Ordered the breakfast quesadilla. It was huge !! The food was very tasty, probably one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. My only reason to give it 4 stars instead of five was that it took about 45 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered."
619,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Great food! Mediocre service. Huge portions and delicious drunk food! Maybe the foods soo good cause I'm drunk? The restaurant though is a mess, waiters walking over napkins and things on the ground.. tables left dirty entire time we are there... but hey. Those potatoes are delicious l!"
620,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When a 30-40min wait is WELL worth it!!

We got to Hash House around 940AM and we were seated in the projected time frame! I ordered the Chicken eggs Benedict and my friend ordered the Chicken and Waffles!! My myy were both dishes delishhh!!! We also ordered pineapple mimosas which were just okay.

Chicken Eggs Benedict:
A tower of a large chicken breast, covered in hollandaise sauce, with scrambled eggs, on top of a biscuit, on top of mashed potatoes!! Wheww!! I literally could only eat 1/3 of this dish. It had an unexpected kick to it but was not to much. If you love savory breakfast dishes you will love this!

Chicken and Waffles:
This is for those sweet breakfast eaters! 
Two chicken breasts on top of 3 crispy waffles!!
DELISHHH!! Even with the syrup the waffles retained their crispy goodness!!
My friend could only finish one breast and one waffle!!

Hash House with their excellent food, grand portions, and great staff has hit my personal top 5 food places I have EVER tried!!
GOO HASH HOUSE A GO GO!!"
621,Hash House A Go Go,1,This place has horrible service! Won't seat till full party there so give away your spot and no cell service nothing like the one on Sahara! Don't bother!
622,Hash House A Go Go,5,I can not explain how much fun we had sitting at the bar with Koti! She was extremely attentive and offered recommendation on other places to eat. We were going to sit at a table but enjoyed her personality so much we ate our lunch at the bar. Her recommendations on food were amazing! And she made the best spicy Bloody Mary we have had in Vegas to date! Besides the service the food was amazing! WARNING the portions are HUGE! We will definitely be back or make sure all our friend and family visit this place!
623,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food was great. Had the spicy burger and it was really good. So much food! I suggest sharing a plate with someone. Reason this got 3 stars is because the service was so slow! It took 20 minutes, yes 20 minutes for us to get our cocktails
 The place was pretty empty at the time (3pm) and our cocktails came out 2 minutes before our food did. When we said something the waitress didn't really care. Food good, service so so."
624,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I've visited Las Vegas many of times and always wanted to try this restaurant. My fiancÃ© and I finally gave this place a shot for a late brunch and we were very disappointed. She ordered the corned beef sandwich while I ordered the famous sage chicken and waffle tower. The corned beef was decent but nothing to rave about. The chicken was over loaded with sage flavor and was just overall very bland in taste. The waffles didn't have much flavor to them at all. 

We did get seated right away which was very surprising after reading reviews of long wait times. We visited on a Friday around 1 PM. Service was good.

If you're looking for a place to eat breakfast or lunch, I advise many of the different buffets the strip has to offer. Don't waste your time or money here."
625,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food: It's all about portions here. I strongly advise sharing, most people cannot and should not eat that much food in one sitting. The machaca was okay, the potatoes tasted like mashed potatoes. I had a bowl of oatmeal and it was just okay. The bowl is filled with fruits and the only fruit I wanted they did not have. How do you not have strawberries during summer?

Drinks: We did not have drinks but there is a full bar that you can sit at and watch television.

Ambience: We put our name on the wait list for 1.5 hours and waited in line to be seated when we returned. 

Staff: Everyone is friendly and willing to help out other waitress. Their goal is to get people in and out with excellent service. 

Overall Experience: HH is famous and although the food looks pretty and big portions, it was just okay. If you are looking for that hangover meal or pinching pennies and need to share I recommend HH. 

3/5 not sure I would go again, but I recommend going for the experience"
626,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Come on LINQ...Please get this place together. we walked in and past the hostess stand, no hostess in sight. After 15 minutes she reluctantly came over to seat us. No smile. Looked like it was the worst night of her life. The waiter comes over 20 minutes in and says ""the person who was suppose to take this table is getting ready to clock out so I GUESS I'll take you"". Mmmmmkay? Thank you for accommodating paying customers? Lol. The guys next to us didn't get served for 20 minutes until we asked for a manager for them. The service is appalling and when we spoke to the manager he was nice enough but needs to get the attitudes of his staff adjusted. Lol. Also, food is okay but cold. Overall, it made us feel like we inconvenienced them by eating there"
627,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was amazing ! I had the fried egg benedict it was one of the best things I ever ate ! The chipotle cream sauce on top was yummy!  If I could have this shipped to me back home i'd pay for it !
628,Hash House A Go Go,1,"After the hour plus wait (not an issue), it took the waitress 20 minutes to come to our table. Another 35 minutes passed before we received our water and then drink orders. The manager did absolutely nothing."
629,Hash House A Go Go,4,Delicious!    But you better be starving or plan to share meals as the portions are BIG!   I'd given them 5 stats but the cigarette smoke wafted up to the restaurant and isn't exactly pleasant while  waiting for your food and while eating.
630,Hash House A Go Go,5,HAD THE BEST CHICKEN AND WAFFLES EVER!!! The chicken breast was seasoned very well without overdoing it. Great creation with adding bacon within the waffle as well... AMAZING!
631,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After been wanting try this restaurant for years after watching man vs food I was alittle disappointed. We walked in the restaurant inside the Linq hotel and was surprised how low the lighting was. Didn't know if I was in the mood to eat or sleep. Also Saw a lady get carted off by some EMT but that didn't effect my ratings(probably drank too much).Order the sage chicken and biscuit and thought it was good but didn't finish half of it. They do give you a lot of food but again the light was so depressing my appetite wasn't there. Maybe I'll try this restaurant again, but not this location"
632,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Stopped here on a recommendation from a friend. Met all expectations!! The dishes are huge and easy to split! We split the Indiana tenderloin (I think?) with the mashed potatoes, creamy BBQ sauce, and cheese. OMG, it was the most delicious meal we had in Vegas! Would definitely eat here again."
633,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Service was a little slow and food came out a different times, but everything was delicious! The brown sugar banana pancakes are definitely a good move!"
634,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I really love this place, their food and atmosphere is just so much fun and I love their food. The staff always make it great to be there!"
635,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When we got there in Sunday am, there was a 45 min wait. A sign said to sit at the bar to shorten the wait time. So we sat at the bar! Within 15 min we were ordering and boom! We got served shortly after. Food was amazing!! Perks about sitting at the bar was seeing all the amazing drinks being made, interacting with the bartenders, getting a seat quickly and tv view. The food was amazing! I had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuit, fruit, eggs and bacon waffles. Yum. The plates were enormous so fiancÃ© and I split it."
636,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Portions as mentioned previously are huge and _have_ to be split between at least two people (there was no surcharge for splitting). We ordered the Turkey special (this being Thanksgiving lunch) as well as the fried sage chicken special made famous by the Man vs. Food show -- recommended by our waitress. Both were fair to middlin' on the taste side but did not live up to the hype. Our total bill for two entrees came up to about $55 after all taxes and a 20% tip.

My criticism hinges on two small but critical issues concerning their policy.

My wife wanted biscuits or bread to hold us over the (waitress promised) forty minute ordering wait (after the half hour seating wait). We were given one (one!) lone biscuit but later found that we were charged $4.50 for this one lone biscuit. Had we known biscuits cost $4.50 each at this place -- we wouldn't have ordered them. Most nice restaurants will _NOT_ charge you for bread or biscuits (including say a certain nice food outlet from the 'Outback' where we had lunch the day before). I am still amazed that even after I discussed this politely with a manager -- he stood his ground on charging us. So -- don't order biscuits  while waiting unless you want to pay $4.50 each. You've been warned...

Second -- I noticed that the hugeness of the portions were primarily due to overly generous (and inexpensive) helpings of mashed potatoes, mashed yams and multiple examples of the formerly mentioned biscuits accompanying the 'good' parts (chicken, beef etc.). True -- the overall taste may not offend some but people not used to this much starchy carb overload may do well to stay away. 

As far as our experience -- we sadly won't be back to sample the $4.50 biscuits or the comfort food -- Martha Stewart's endorsements notwithstanding."
637,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'll knock off 0.5 star for being in the pretty meh Imperial Palace... and another 0.5 star for the massive wait most people have to go through to eat here.

This place is pretty top notch.  I had eaten at the one out in 'Vegas' Vegas and when on a tiny trip up here for the May 2012 solar eclipse I ate breakfast at this location.

Their food is massive... the price isn't cheap... but it's really good.

Get up a bit early and get in here before the crowds show up.  It'll be a tasty filling breakfast!"
638,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Come here if you are the patient and hungry type (read: not hangry). Wait times are ridiculous and can be anywhere from 20-60 minutes during peak meal hours, but if you manage to get in, you'll find out that they serve absolutely MASSIVE portions of EVERYTHING on their menu.

With a name like Hash House, you certainly can't go wrong with their traditional hashes, but the thing to try is the chicken and waffles. Giant pieces of crispy fried chicken atop fluffy sage waffles drizzled with maple syrup. The enormous plate comes with a giant steak knife stabbed right in the middle -- it doesn't get much more epic than that. If you manage to finish this plate by yourself, I bow down to you. I scruffed through barely half of it, and I was already ready to roll back down the escalator in a food coma.

I also hear that they're open 24 hours, so if you're craving a massive meal after a crazy night of clubbing and/or drinking, they might be a good place for some drunken munchies."
639,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great place for breakfast. The portions are large. The service was very friendly. I liked the souvenir slanted glass.
640,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place, I would recommend the chicken and waffels. You can share this with someone as the protions are huge!! My friend had the pancakes and they are gigantic!! The food and service were great. Since it is such a popular spot the wait can be long, but it is worth it."
641,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After seeing the Hash House A Go Go on the Travel Channel, I knew that we had to stop there for brunch while we were in Vegas. The minute I saw the bacon waffles on tv, I knew I had to try them!

This particular Hash House A Go Go is located inside Imperial Palace (eek!). It was pretty busy when we walked in, so we expected to wait for a good hour. The hostess quoted our party 45 mins. to an hour, which isn't too bad, unless you're hungover and starving...which we all were. Luckily, since there were so many people, some parties decided to leave, which meant that we only had to wait about 20-25 minutes! 

We ordered:
-Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles
-Bacon Waffles
-Corned Beef Hash
-Biscuits and Gravy and Scrambled Eggs

The bacon waffles were sweet and there were pretty generous slices of bacon inside. I wish I had ordered the waffles with some strawberries on top just to give it a little more sweetness - the syrup just wasn't enough! I didn't taste any of the other dishes, since I was so occupied with attempting to finish mine, but everyone definitely enjoyed their food.

Our server did his best with the crowds - it was pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. I didn't expect stellar service anyway, I just wanted to eat. You are definitely in for huge portions and a lot of food so if you're on a budget or aren't TOO hungry, I'd suggest sharing or you'll end up with some leftovers."
642,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This joint came highly recommended by a client who said the meal there was ""magnificent.""  

It was magnificently disappointing.  

After making my mom trudge through the crap-hole that is, the Imperial Palace, we took the middle escalator (important fact) up to HHAGG.  

There was no wait, but it was relatively late after the LOVE show.  We were both tired, hungry and not feeling well.  I ordered the grilled cheese.  It was huge and had a steak knife stuck in the middle.  The bread wasn't very grilled and the cheese wasn't melted and gooey.  But it was BIG.    

Mom wanted a BLT which is served on the lunch menu and although they serve sandwiches at dinner, the BLT isn't one of the dinner offerings so no dice.  This rule was explained by our somewhat ditsy server who said it was important to ""maintain the integrity of the original HH in order to keep the license. ""  That made us feel so much better about the lack of accommodation.    

She ordered a Cesar salad instead.  It was a huge plate of iceberg lettuce, some croutons and a giant tree of Rosemary.  Wha???

Much like the LOVE show, I didn't really ""get"" HHAGG.  

I sense the original version in San Diego is much better so skip the Vegas rendition."
643,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First time eating at this place.  Absolutely loved it.  My friend and I shared to plates, and had enough for two or more meals left over.  The portions are ridiculously big, and the food is delicious.  Their famous Kokomo is worth trying!"
644,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was pretty good, but I wish we had tried the breakfasts. This is what they're known for after all. We just weren't feeling breakfast at 10pm, and I regret it in hindsight... I ordered a corned beef sandwich on rye and the boyfriend had a burger. Their food concoctions are pretty creative and the quality is good, but I wasn't blown away. But I'm definitely going to hit up Hash House a Go Go again at some point to try their breakfast to see if it's worth that extra star. TIP: the portions are HUGE, so it would be wise to split a dish between two people."
645,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Everything I've tried here tastes amazing with so much flavor! Not to mention the huge portions that will leave you with leftovers so you definitely get your money worth. I've tried the crab cakes, the meatloaf, the Andy Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, the Blueberry Pecan Flapjack, the Meatloaf Benedict, and the Crab Cake Benedict; All were delicious! When people come to vegas and ask me where to eat, I always recommend Hash House!"
646,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Delicious food and ENORMOUS portions. 
Only drawback....rude front of the house crew that would rather share party stories than seat patrons.
Server was great and the BLT bloody Mary is terrific."
647,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Seriously! Hash House A Go Go brings the flavor to every bite on the plate. Its talks quality and quantity. Everything we ordered was flavorful, delicious, and we really enjoyed our brunch. I usually do not order chicken dishes when I go out cause that is something I can easily make at home. BUT, the fried chicken offered at Hash House was juicy and cooked perfectly. I had Andys sage fried chicken benedict and it was great! The plate is loaded with carbs so I left a lot of it on the plate. However, I enjoyed the bacon surprises and, again, the flavor was damn good! Hubby had the crab cake sandwich that was juicy, fresh and yummy as well with a side of mac and cheese. Their mac and cheese was creamy, warm, cheesy and absolutely DEE-LICIOUS! We also had the chicken and waffles. Waffles were good and the chicken, to repeat, was juicy and cooked perfectly. Maple on top was KILLER! I would highly recommend this place to anybody that wants to check it out! Oh, nice drink options as well!"
648,Hash House A Go Go,5,Good food.. price is ok.. and its open 24/7.. best place to go after partying or gambling..
649,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I had the simple breakfasts with bacon- the potatoes were old and dry, the bacon a little over cooked for my liking, the biscuit and gravy were ok.overall I give it a below ok meal. I should mention that the portions are huge & Great Customer service!!- soo you decide!"
650,Hash House A Go Go,1,"ZERO STARS. Good food, enormous portions however the service is POOR. Too many amazing places to eat in Vegas to have to deal with the crappy service and inappropriate people working here."
651,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had the Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict as recommended by pretty much everyone, and yes it was sooo good, just a mountain of deliciousness.  The jam on the table was really tasty on the biscuit, too.  We also had the highly-recommended Watermelon-Kiwi lemonade and yes it was pretty, sweet and yummy, tasted a bit like a Jolly Rancher at first and then moved onto just fruity.  Let me tell you, the Warm Spinach Salad was possibly the most delicious salad I've ever had in my life.   

The chicken hash, was kind of eh next to the other scrumptious dishes on our table, the chicken a wee bit dry and the asparagus a touch tough/stringy. 

Decor was very nice and our waiter was very nice and accommodating, noticing immediately when our special orders did not come out of the kitchen.  It was rather interesting to find though, following the signs down an alley off the strip to get to the Imperial and then finding the stairs to restaurant in the center of the casino ^.^"
652,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A group of us came here with a friend who highly recommended the place, and I had the biggest pancake I've ever seen in my life. It was a fun way to start the day."
653,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went here for breakfast not quite knowing what to expect. Well, I can honestly say that my expectations were not only met, but exceeded! Girlfriend and I looked around at all the other tables around us, and noticed that the portions were huge, so we decided to split the chicken and waffles. It was absolutely amazing, and I wasn't quite sure that I was going to enjoy it, considering that chicken and waffles is a southern thing and I'm from the Midwest. The chicken was tender and the waffles were stuffed with bacon! How can you go wrong with that?! We both ordered OJ to drink, and it tasted as if it had just been squeezed! The atmosphere in the restaurant takes on a farm theme, and it is very fitting, The decor, the fixtures, the tables, it all goes together very well. The prices are a little steep (the OJ was $7 per glass!) but hey, it's Vegas. You have to expect to pay more."
654,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm give this a four on the food and food alone. It's amazing! Unfortunately, the service is terrible. My cocktail was made incorrectly and it took me so long to get are waitress to fix it everyone was already done eating. In addition, as they do warn you and are very upfront about how long it takes your food to come out, just make sure you're in a hurry. It's a good 30/40 minute wait once you order."
655,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I visited Las Vegas, Nevada in November for the first time. I surveyed several of my friends that had visited the city several times. They were asked about all the best places to eat in Las Vegas. This place was highly recommended by all my friends. THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT! First off, Las Vegas is crawling with tourist. So upon arrival, the place was swarming with people. Hash House A Go Go is located in The Quad hotel, but it has several other locations in Las Vegas.  We decided to do breakfast there. When we  arrived the hostess told us the wait was 45 minutes to an hour. Well, per usual, I was hungry and since we'd walked there from our hotel on the other side of the Las Vegas Strip, we were eating there. Just our luck, two seats opened up at the bar and we pounced on them. That made our wait about 2 minutes. 

Again, my friends raved about the breakfast at this place and no one spoke about the service. The service was great! The place gave me a southern feel. So it felt like home to me all they way over on the West Coast. Immediately, the server asked where I was from. You don't realize you have an accent until you travel. Lol! She was so helpful. She explained the meals like she was the chef/cook that prepared them. After her spill, I decided on the Brown Sugar Banana FlapJack, which was enormous. It came with scrambled eggs and potatoes. It was awesome. I chose this because the man next to me was eating and enjoying it. I don't remember what my friend Andrea ordered, but she liked her selection also. 

The selection at this place is vast. Be prepared for a wait if you are with a group. The bar is ideal for two people. The serving size is really big. Once you are seated the service is fast.  Come with an appetite. I'm visiting Orlando, Florida in a few days and they have a Hash House A Go Go there. I'm taking my family and I hope the experience is the same."
656,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I give this place 3.5 stars. This may be one of those places that are super yelpy because it is open 24/7 and people who have drunchies love this place. Well I went here on mlk at around 12:30 and the wait for 7 people was an hour. So we walked along that strip and gambled at the $5 war tables and returned. They actually called my name already so I would return after 40 minutes. They were nice enough and let us go. As everyone says, the portions are out of this world. A pancake will cover the plate and these plates are the big huge ones steaks would be on. It would seriously be the size of four pancakes combined. Well I got the chicken and waffles and def split that. Two pieces of chicken and four waffles so perfect for two. The chicken was actually tender and good but needed flavor. Ask for the cucumber ranch dressing at the beginning. You will thank me. The waffles were good and had bacon in between which was a nice surprise. Overall it was good but I can tell this is more of a Instagram moment place. I also shared the watermelon kiwi lemonade thing they are known for. Yummy! It ended up being around $26 after tax and tip."
657,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wowza!  The portions here are HUGE and probably could be shared - but I'll bet you won't!  I had the corned beef hash and egg breakfast and could not finish it.  I wish we had had a fridge in our room so we could have taken a ""doggy bag""..  A little bit of a wait, but we had 12 people, so we expected it.  We didn't all sit together and that was okay also.  Go.  Eat.  Enjoy.  You'll be glad you did!"
658,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A must-have if you're on the Las Vegas Strip.  They do get busy.  Luckily, it wasn't too busy when we got there...around 11:00am.  They said it was a 30min wait, but we only waited like 10min.  Get the Chicken and Waffles.  The serving is enough for 2 people unless you're really hungry.  Their stuffed burgers are big...two burger patties.  We also  ordered their Corn Beef and it was good.  It had good flavors.  We will definitely return."
659,Hash House A Go Go,1,The food was alright. But the customer service that they had was awful. They complained about the littlest thing. The people who worked here had awful attitudes for no reason. I would not recommend anyone to come here.
660,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First time here...get ready to eat!
Stupendously large portions.
Got Andys fried chicken & a pastrami pub sandwich.  Both were yummy.  Impossible to finish, though, especially the platter of mile high chicken!
Service was average.
Wait time not excessive.
Would definitely recommend & return."
661,Hash House A Go Go,5,Although the line may be very long just go down to the Quad and spend some time there. Time passes by very fast around Vegas.
662,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went for breakfast. Son had pancake and I had a chicken hash. Pancake was huge and very good. My food came in a skillet but was luke warm. The flavor was bland for a hash dish. Biscuit was like a lead weight, not flaky. 

Was excited to try based on reviews. Much better places to eat breakfast then here."
663,Hash House A Go Go,3,"How could I not stop by where Man vs Food had been???

The portions here are so huge, it's no surprise that Adam Richman stopped by.  My bf and I shared the sage fried chicken and bacon waffles and we were both stuffed at the end of our meal.  It comes with 2 chicken breasts and 4 waffles so it's easily shared among two people.  The waffles are fluffy and having the idea to put bacon strips in the middle was a stroke of genius.  The chicken on the other hand was a tad on the bland and dry side.  But the meal overall was pretty satisfying.

As you step inside you'll feel like you've been transported to the South.  I decor is very charming and pretty fancy compared to other parts of Imperial Palace.  The staff is friendly and quick with your order. 

So Go Go to Hash House A Go Go!"
664,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Line out the door and on my one person doing the seating. Empty table and here we wait. Some kind of game?

This place sucks!  Been to others but this is the worst. Everything stops to seat just one table. A group of seven and the hostess can not seem to figure out she can seat other groups while they wait for the seven. 

The staff has time to fart around with each other but can not do what they get paid for.

So we just went into the restaurant and we past 6 empty tables. This is just stupid. Where is the Managment? Do they let this one do what ever she wants. 

Oh yeah 25 min still no waiters.  

Ok. So we saw the waitress. Took our order. We pointed out that my wife's fork was sticky. They got the bus person you just cleared the table behind us to get new silverware. Did not wash his hands and then proceeded to touch our silverware. (Just to note, I am in food safety.) So what ever yuck the couple had got on their forks, then the bus persons hand, then onto my fork then yuck into my food (if I had not noticed).

Just GROSS. 

So the food came. Mine 7 min before my wife's. So, my fault, I guess. I waited for my wife to eat and then mine was just not warm. But that being said it tasted ok. Now my eggs were wrong but they did quickly fix the error. 

So time to check out again a line really!
See pics."
665,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We stumbled upon this place while wondering around the strip and to my surprise the place was really nice and it had a very fun atmosphere. 

My friends and I decided to grab something ""light"" but had no idea the portions were going to be so huge. 

I ordered the mozzarella cheese hamburger. The burger was really big and I also got the side of fries. The patty was very juicy and the temperature was perfect not too hot not too cold.  :) The cheese was perfectly melted on the patty. The sad part was.... THEY HAVE NO RANCH ... they had no RANCH!!!! :( I wanted to dip the fries in ranch !!! GAHHH hahah they gave me cucumber ranch?... which wasn't so bad but... didn't beat ranch.

My friend ordered the smoked Applewood bacon hamburger I was too full to try hers but looked heavenly with the bacon in between the patty and the bun! She also ordered the tangerine mimosa but..that was definitely not a good choice...

Other buddy of mine decided to order the sage fried chicken benedict. The presentation of the dish is very unappealing but the taste is the total opposite of what It looks like. There's so many flavors in one bite but it's complimentary with each other! 

Definitely a place to try when you're in the area and for the portion the price isn't so bad ! :) we actually took the left over back to the room and was enough to feed two people."
666,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First off, DEFINITELY recommend this restaurant!
But I'm telling you, you better be hungry. :)
My boyfriend and I went here for the first time last month (for my birthday breakfast). I chose it because of all the hype I heard about it. I was not dissapointed one bit! 
The food is awesome (some of the best I've ever had eating out) and the service was good, too.
I was surprised on how huge the portions were! And for the price, such a killer deal. I ordered the biscuits and gravy (which was served over mashed potatoes and topped with scrambled eggs.) And my boyfriend got the corned beef skillet. Both were to-die-for meals. We also noticed how tasty their eggs were, some of the best we've had. I wish I could go back and try their famous fried chicken and waffles I've heard so much about. 

If you are in Vegas, this place is a MUST! Seriously, you will be so impressed."
667,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was so good and all the staff is very friendly. Our waiter was Toby S. He was very friendly and made sure we were happy and was very accommodating. He recommended the s'mores hot chocolate, definitely was the best hot chocolate. I got the Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin comes with the pork tenderloin, eggs, mashed potatoes, biscuits, spinach, and tomato. Lots of food and well worth the price. (17.99) My mom got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict she loved it also comes with a lot of food for a good price (18.99). While we were eating we were wondering what we were going to do with all this good once we were done. Once we were done eating Toby came to take our plates and my mom made a comment about wasting so much food, but really no food is wasted there. Toby told us that the restaurant knows that a good amount of the food won't get eaten (because everything is such big portions) so they donate it to a local pig farm in Vegas. Which made us both so happy to hear especially me because I love pigs. I highly recommend you come and eat here, and we will definitely be coming back and bringing our family too. Thank you Has House for your friendly service and great food."
668,Hash House A Go Go,5,My friends and I went here for breakfast and it was amazing.  The portions were so huge we could have shared! I recommend the pancakes and the chicken and waffles.  Food is quality but so is the service.  Our waiter was kinda quirky but fun.  Highly recommend going but wait until you are starving!!!
669,Hash House A Go Go,4,La comida es buena .... Cuidado los platos son muy grandes si no comes mucho comparte plato
670,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Anytime Im near a Hash House its a must that I visit. I especially love to bring friends that have never been, just to see the looks on their faces when their food comes out. This time I managed to eat their 2x and tried something new each time. The salmon scramble was decent, however, the salmon was somewhat ""fishy"" and more like dry tuna than a moist salmon. So this particular meal I was disappointed in my choice. Upon my return for Easter Brunch I had the BEST Bloody Mary I have ever had and I tried their Meatloaf Sandwich (The Kokomo). The meatloaf was amazing! Best thing Ive had yet though is the Sage Chicken Hash.but Im going to keep trying something new everytime I can go! Love this place!!!"
671,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had. It's definitely worth noting that you will most certainly have a wait prior to being seated, so expect to kill some time. The staff is pretty good about warning you that your order is made fresh so you have about a 30 minute wait from order to table. It's well worth the wait so bring your phone or some crayons and let the chefs do their thing! The portions are HUGE, hence the eggs Benedict being on man vs food. The homemade biscuits and homemade jam are delectable. You'll feel like you're sitting in a southern kitchen! I ordered a turkey scramble which had huge helpings of country potatoes, the scramble, and a large buttermilk biscuit. I wanted to eat it all but I just couldn't! 

I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone visiting (or not) and wanting a breakfast experience unlike any other. Sooooo delicious, you will not be disappointed!"
672,Hash House A Go Go,1,"My husband and i were so hungry. I checked on yelp and as it was the nearest resto, we chose to go there. The burger apparence was so good but when  we started to eat, we couldnt recognize the meat taste. It was horrible. DON't go there. NEVER"
673,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The worst breakfast we've ever had, 2 breakfasts cost $37. The eggs were overcooked the waffle was undercooked and doughy, we told the manager and his response was ""We can't check every order when it comes out, you should've told us earlier "" this place was way overpriced and the food was terrible."
674,Hash House A Go Go,5,"""SWEET BABY JESUS!"" The food portions at this place will make you think twice! Lol!!!! I highly recommend that you come here with an appetite because you'll definitely be needing one! I introduced my family to this place and they were in for the shock of their lives. The pancakes or should I say pancake is so huge that it goes over the plate it's served on!  The prices match the food you will receive, ""Literally!"" I recommend that you share a meal with someone. Other than that the food is great! ""My favorite here is the Meatloaf Sandwich!"":-)"
675,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Large portions, decent prices! Came here with my family, group of 7 plus a baby, we made a reservation so we had no wait time essentially. Out of the 7, for 3 of us, this was our first time coming here. The portions are no joke. Each dish we had probably coulda fed 3 people and we ordered 6 dishes lol. The watermelon chicken stack had a lot of great flavors and was easily one of my favorite dishes. We had a crab cake which was simply a mountain of crab, sauce, biscuits and flavors. The chicken and waffles were okay, the chicken pieces were a bit dry but the aesthetics of the plate was definitely instagram worthy (and my profile pic worthy lol). 

Definitely cannot wait to come back here!"
676,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Can't go wrong with this place. I just want to put this out there, our server, PJ, was the best!!! He was nice, very friendly, courteous and had great recommendations. Would definitely come back!"
677,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Got the chirizo hash - ehh, just OK.  Split that, but I ordered biscuit and gravy which was pretty tasty and large on it's own."
678,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Let me tell you about my little fiend friend, Hash House a Go-Go. 
Their monstrous food will leave you raising your little white flag like a loser. 
Only a crazy can finish a meal. I wished hard for my boyfriend to have been around to help me with the other half portion of my dish that I didn't finish. Painfully, I had to throw away my leftovers because our hotel room did not have a microwave for me to heat up and eat later. Utter food gloom, because it was that delicious of a burger! Still hurts thinking about it. Disappointed, a big fat fail :[
You won this round Hash House, but i'll come back prepared with my other half of appetite army.

For anyone reading this, I dare you to finish a meal here."
679,Hash House A Go Go,4,Really good but the portions are ridiculously huge. Like probably enough to feed 3 people! Please share an entree!
680,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious food. Large portions.  Decent price.  My husband and his friend carbing up for their Spartan Race tomorrow.   We had the meatloaf, corned beef, and Apple cinnamon flapjack.  Great location and awesome service from staff. Special shout out to Ms. Kendra Compton, she is such an awesome waitress - took good care of us and had such a positive attitude through her busy day.   She definitely deserves a kudos!"
681,Hash House A Go Go,1,This place has some of the worst service I've ever seen. At least they let me use their WiFi to write this review up. God this place sucks. Avoid it at all costs.
682,Hash House A Go Go,4,"HUGE PORTIONS, sharing is probably a good idea.  My plate was filled full of food and I couldn't of finished if I tried.  Hard to eat healthy here.  I had the chicken and eggs, came with bacon, potatoes, etc, etc, etc.  The Special Bloody Mary is a meal in itself as well."
683,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food is amazing but I'm only giving this place 3 stars because our waiter was extremely slow, inattentive and clueless. We had to ask Rick 3 times for straws, lemons and napkins, not once did he ask our group how our food was or if we were in need of anything."
684,Hash House A Go Go,1,No stars for Hash A Go Go.  We waited over 45 minutes for frozen sunny side eggs.  We asked for a new order only to be served more frozen sunny side eggs.  Avoid if Salmonella is not your thing.
685,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is legitimately the most delicious brunch place I've ever been to.  WORTH THE WAIT.   There are not words to describe the euphoria I had while eating here.  Big helpings. Friendly staff.
686,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was excited to try the Sage Chicken & Waffles but I couldn't justify ordering such a ridiculous amount of food. I wasn't in the mood for a burger but opted for the Baby Burger thinking it was a more appropriate amount of food. That wasn't the case. It was also served dry. I wanted to order the same breakfast potatoes with my burger that my friend ordered with her meal but was told I couldn't. I settled for bacon & cheese mashed potatoes instead. We wanted bloody beers but were told we couldn't get those either. Strange because they serve both beer and Bloody Mary's. Our server came off as friendly but then seemed somewhat annoyed and put out when I asked her questions. Also strange since she said we were her first customers of the day. Overall, I might go back. But only if I was sharing a meal with at least 1 more person because the meal sizes were just too enormous. A fresh baked biscuit with butter & their fresh strawberry jam with a cup of coffee would've been a better choice."
687,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm giving this place 5 stars again...despite the mishap my boyfriend and I had when we came in to give our name to the hostess.  We went through the platinum line and the hostess said that it would be 2 minutes til we got our seats.  We waited for about 10 maybe almost 15 minutes until I asked her how much longer it would.  Get this, girl did not even put our name down! We gave her my boyfriend's card and everything and she did not put it down.  It wasn't that we were annoyed that we weren't seated yet, it was more so that she had all these other names written down but ours.

Thankfully an awesome hostess came by named tammy or kami and helped us out and we were seated right away.  From there service was pretty good.  They were busy, like last time, but managed to get our orders in time and correct.  My boyfriend got his 'ol time favorite the andy's sage fried chicken.  And yours truly???? Well, if you read my previous review I wasn't too happy with my last dish.  This time changing it up made a world of a difference.

Have you ever read any of Emi H.'s reviews  in Honolulu?? where she talks about food and dating?! I'm here to tell you it is absolutely positively TRUE!  When it comes to courting food you look for certain qualities that will WOW your tastebuds and keep you coming back for more.  When you're dating you're looking for qualities that complement you and vice versa and yes keep you coming back for more fun times, memories, pictures, whatever tickles your pickle!  

This visit to hash house was equivalent to falling in love... =)  I ordered the:
Hash House original  w/smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach,roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs for $11.95.  

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=AGDIWhSHNlR8wGsLkC93Sw#AGDIWhSHNlR8wGsLkC93Sw

From my first bite my eyes were wide open, my tastebuds were singing, and I immediately blurted out to my boyfriend that I was in sweet wonderful love with my food!! It takes awhile to find your true love but when you do it's like fireworks are going off around you!! 

I highly recommend this dish! Also, our waitress was wonderful, attentive, and refilled our waters in a timely manner.  These dishes are our absolute favorites and every time we're in vegas we make a stop at Hash House to spend some time with our true loves of food! =)"
688,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Open 24/7, has ""adult"" beverages and is conveniently located on the strip.. what more could you ask? The service was excellent, they offer free wi-fi and the food was really good with decent sized portions. My one and only complaint-- they don't have much on their menu for vegetarians besides salads and pancakes. I wanted one of those juicy looking burgers but I didn't see any veggie patties to substitute. 

Don't forget to snap your pix of the food presentation  =) Especially if you get the chicken and waffles!"
689,Hash House A Go Go,5,A must go when you go to Vegas. The portions are huge and the waiters are extremely nice and professional. Had the vanilla waffles and cappuccino.
690,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Portions are huge! A group of 5 split the chicken eggs benedict (our favorite), banana pancake and chicken and waffles and we all ordered a bloody mary and only paid $20 each! A steal for Vegas!!"
691,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The BLT Bloody Mary was pretty much the best thing that has happened to my mornings, in a VERY long time. 
 
Was in Vegas the past few nights and absolutely loved Hash House A Go Go.  We could not get over how massive the portions were and how tasty the food was.  So much so in fact, that we visited two mornings in a row!  The first morning I had their take on an eggs benedict that featured griddled mashed potatoes, a red pepper cream sauce with spinach, tomatoes and bacon.  TO DIE FOR.  Impossible to finish.  My boyfriend had the chorizo hash which was also delish, but my benny took the gold medal on that meal. 

The next morning we re-visited and I had waffles with bacon, eggs and crispy potatoes.  The meal was pretty standard, but the waffles put this meal at 4 stars. This morning, my boyfriend tried the house favourite Fried Chicken Benedict.  UN-BE-LIEV-ABLE. The chipotle cream sauce absolutely makes this dish, coupled with their famous Sage Fried Chicken.  Wow. 

I am a huge fan of this place, and fully intend on returning upon my next Vegas vacation. Even better than huge portions?  The extremely reasonable prices that go along with them."
692,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I don't even know where to start with this review. 

I'll start by saying that my bf and I went for breakfast and we went at the PERFECT time. Around 8:30am. By the time we left, there was a 45 minute wait and tons of people waiting to be seated. It's worth the hype.

We ordered biscuits and sausage gravy, chicken and waffles, and and chicken asparagus hash. Yum yum yum!! The plates were almost half the size of the table and you could probably feed 3 people with one plate. Everything was so delicious and out waitress, Tammy I think? Tawny maybe? Was soo pleasant, and we even overheard her telling another table how much she enjoys working there and everyone there is like family. THIS is the kind of establishment we love to support. 

Hash House a Go Go is what dreams are made of."
693,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Okay, I'm feeling a little old because my daughter Muff just turned 16 on New Year's Eve.  I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and she said that she wanted to go to Las Vegas. (16 year old birthday presents sure have changed since I turned 16.  My parents gave me a card and said that if I wanted to drive, I would have to buy my own car.  End of story.)  Fast forward to today and off we go to Vegas.  

Muff has been watching various food shows, like forever, and decided that she wanted to go Hash House A-Go-Go for one of her gifts.  With Muff, my sister, sister-in-law and nieces in tow, we set off to procure a table.   To say that everyone in Vegas attempted to do the same thing at the same time is an understatement.  However, the food gods must have been smiling down upon us because we got a table within 10 minutes of getting there. (Apparently, it helped that we had a large party.) With the exception of my one niece who ordered the Brown Sugar Banana Flapjacks, everyone else in our group ordered ""The Big O' Sage Fried Chicken & Waffle Tower"" with two sage fried chicken breasts, 4 smoked bacon waffles, hot maple reduction, fried leeks and served with two eggs.  Lawd a mercy!  The fried chicken alone is enough to make you whimper.  As soon as that food hit the table, you would have sworn that a pack of wild dogs has descended upon the food.  Goody goody!

This is my second or third trip to this restaurant known for ""Twisted Farm Food"" (I think the twisted should be interpreted as gigunda portions of crave worthy food.)  If you're stoner, we may never see you leave this place.  It's righteously tasty!"
694,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I have to say the wait was pretty freaking long at this place which was weird because when us 3 musketeers were finally seated after waiting an hour we saw all these other clean empty tables inside.  This is not  nightclub, you don't have to fake the exclusivity funk alright?  

JH & BB both ordered the fried chicken with bacon waffles with a side of biscuits & gravy and eggs over easy.  As for me I decided to go with the HH Original Eggs Benedict wanting something more traditional for breakfast.  However, I have to say there was nothing traditional about my dish.  

The portion sizes here are ridiculous, meant for severely overweight, gluttonous people, potheads and body builders.  I was only able to have half of my plate and even then I started to suffer from food coma.  Taste wise it was a-ok, it didn't really blow my mind, I think the wow-factor for this place is the portion size more than the flavor if anything.  Everything seemed a little lacking in flavor to me, maybe it was because I woke up drunk from the night before?  All I know for sure is that the biscuits and gravy I make at home from scratch are way more tasty than theirs.  

To be honest I don't think I'd come out of my way to eat here when in Vegas unless I'm pregnant and want something artery clogging."

696,Hash House A Go Go,5,Incredible food for a great price. Portions are HUGE!
697,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The place is amazingly good. My husband and I visited Las Vegas and stayed at the Imperial Palace. We ate here at least 3 times. Great Food, Big Portions."
698,Hash House A Go Go,3,"As our first meal in Vegas it was a complete fail! 3 of us went for the sage fried chicken & bacon waffles since it seemed popular in reviews & it was a great presentation & great portion size but the chicken had so much breading(not skin) & was so dry it was hard to swallow ! The bacon waffles were the best part but still were very hard no flavor unless you got bacon in the bite. Overall I felt cheated out of bomb fried chicken lol so did the other people in our group. 

Two of them got the stuffed avocado burger & the proportion of bun to meat was so small & it was just tooth picked between the patties no juices or melting cheese. They said it was pretty overcooked & messy. 

So unlike hash house back in SD this one I will never return to ! Waste of $90"
699,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First, the wait is really long. They were telling people 45 minutes to an hour. Be prepared for that. They won't seat large groups without everyone present. 
Our waiter was super awesome and pretty attentive for having a lot of tables and being super busy. 
The drinks are pretty expensive and most of them do not have free refills. Our food took a while to come but it was worth the wait. It was definitely freshly made and everything everyone ordered was delicious. 
I highly recommend waiting and trying this place out. Food is amazing!"
700,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait time is super long but I was lucky to grab a seat at the bar and the bar service was amazing! I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict. The portion was enough for three people, I'm looking forward to the leftovers. The cream sauce had just the right amount of kick. This dish was awesome and I can't wait to try other menu items."
701,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Smelled weird, carpet was dirty you can tell while walking over it.  The food was ok, yeah they give you a lot but I prefer quality over quantity.  Service was average.  Will not go again.  Had the chicken and waffles.  Both average."
702,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've been to Hash House on two separate occasions now. My first visit was for breakfast on a previous trip to Las Vegas, and my most recent visit was for dinner. 

The restaurant is located on the upper level of the LINQ Hotel & Casino. The decor is what I'd call a modern farmhouse style. Picture lots of wood and rustic elements mixed with silver metals. I like that particular style, so I felt right at home. 

The portions here are enormous! Neither my husband nor I could could finish even half of our plates during either visit. The dishes are shareable, which I highly suggest if you're coming here with children. They offer a large variety of menu items. A few of the items we've tried from the menu are chicken & waffles, traditional pancake/egg/bacon breakfast, grilled salmon with goat cheese mashed potatoes, and blue cheese stuffed burger and fries. All were very delicious! 

One thing to make note of if you plan to enjoy some of these huge portions yourself... Breakfast usually has a long wait, while lunch and dinner do not. Enjoy!"
703,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Giant portions and very pretty plates but we got the fried chicken Benedict and other than the sauce (that thank goodness we asked for on the side) there wasn't much flavor. The biscuit was probably a few hours to old, the chicken didn't taste like anything. The mashed potatoes were good and the sauce was spicy."
704,Hash House A Go Go,3,I have gone a couple times and both times the food was bland and no flavor. It's not terrible but not the best. Service was decent.
705,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First time here. Seated fast and the waitress was nice. Food is served in big portions, so bring your appetite. The water tasted like tap but that's not too big of a deal. Ordered the HH Quesadilla and it was delicious!!! I'd come here again for sure, to try the waffles or French toast."
706,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our server Alex was AMAZING!! So hard to find a server these days that goes above and beyond just serving you the meal! Very friendly, outgoing, and it was super busy, but Alex was totally on the ball!

I forgot to mention the food was awesome, plenty of leftovers for later!  I had Andy's rosemary chicken with two eggs and taters."
707,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We learned about this place when it was on Man vs Food. We waited for our table for about thirty minutes. After our meal, the line was so packed. Definitely came at the right time for a big brunch. These portions are out of this world big. There was three of us, and we wanted to try three dishes, so we had to go for it.

Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict:

Holy lord. This thing was massive. I mean, it could've fed a family of five. Fried chicken was amazing. The bacon mashed potatoes were amazing. The chipotle sauce this is dripped all over is amazing. This dish will make you feel disgusting and terrific at the same time

Chorizo hash:

Super tasty and spicy. If you like a little kick from the jalapeÃ±os and chorizo, this is a the dish for you

Sage fried chicken and waffles:

Fried chicken was perfectly cooked with a tender inside and crispy outside. I loved the bacon waffles. Add a little of their syrup, it's a perfect dish

This brunch was definitely all the food we needed for the day. A little overwhelming, but absolutely delicious."
708,Hash House A Go Go,5,"MOUTH WATERING FOOD, FAST SERVICE, POLITE SERVERS and NICE AMBIANCE and GREAT LOCATION!!!

We arrived in Vegas at 2:30 and after checking in at Mirage we went to HHGG for midnight breakfast (i.e, around 3 in the morning). The server greeted us very nicely and we were seated right away. The menu had very limited options for late night. We ordered 
-blueberry-pecan flapjacks
-chocolate waffles
-chicken waffles
-Indiana Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin. 

The service was super quick and in no time we were gorging on the food :) The portions were huge and the presentation...OHH my my!!! i loved my pancake which was fluffy and filled with fresh blueberries and also the chocolate waffles which were chocolicious and covered in ice cream!!! the chicken waffles had safe fried chicken and crispy waffles on the bottom which was little dry for my hubby but taste was great. The Pork Tenderloin was amazing and had delicious mashed potatoes on the side and topped with very thin and crispy onion. The waiter was nice enough to accommodate our second request for choco waffles as quickly as possible. 

Overall the experience was memorable and I will definitely recommend checking this place out!"
709,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House is a must, but more importantly is Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The restaurant knows how huge their portions are which is why they try to charge you about $2.50 if you plan on sharing with someone else, so just order a side of a biscuit + butter which is cheaper. Andy's Benedict is a huuuuge hot mess of fried chicken, spinach, eggs, biscuits, tomatoes, cheese and bacon but it is soooooo good with a lot of different flavors and textures going on. 

Service here is great and although they seem to have a lot of seating, there is a pretty long wait especially for larger parties."
710,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The quoted wait time can be a little overwhelming at first, but rest assured the actual time of wait will be less than the quoted one. This is because ppl will end up leaving instead of waiting and this puts you moves you up on the wait list. Portions are huge and the taste is spot on. This is one place to check out when you're in Vegas. 
Tip: The order can take a long time to be prepared and served, so look through the menu while waiting so you can order as soon as you're seated."
711,Hash House A Go Go,4,Omg!!! Food was amazing!! I had heard numerous things about hash house before. We were in Vegas on a family vacation. We went there for breakfast. We should of just ordered 2 entrees for all 4 of us!! We didnt know the portions were soo big. Even the kids food was a large portion. We got there around 8am. Which was perfect timing. It had got crowded when we were leaving. Best part is that its open 24hrs!!
712,Hash House A Go Go,5,Super yum! The Banana Brown sugar flapjack is the most delicious thing ever! All the food is great and def worth the wait.
713,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If Applebees and IHOP had a love child and gave it steroids, it'd be Hash House a Go Go! 

Came here for a quick early dinner before seeing a show at Caesars Palace. Since food at Caesars was either going to be super upscale or a complete rip off with a long wait, we decided to venture across the street to Imperial Palace and found Hash House A Go Go. This place was not bad...not bad at all. Far exceeded my expectation considering it was at the Imperial Palace. The food is American diner style, burgers, fried chicken, pastas and such. Nothing fancy but perfect for a casual dinner which was exactly what we were looking for. We shared the BBQ ribs and the cobb salad. Both were very good. The ribs were soft, moist and meaty. The salad was fresh with a generous amount of toppings. The portions were ridiculously huge, the plates are more like serving platters. I can't wait to come back to try their breakfast menu.
 
No wait time (although we came here early on a weeknight). Great service, the waiter was very attentive and kept giving us drink refills. Reasonably priced especially for the strip and convenient location. What more can you ask for?"
714,Hash House A Go Go,1,"My family lives in LV and loves this place. 
On 12/19, I stopped by to get a gift certificate for them for X-mas. The hostess sent me to the food bar where the lady asked me if I wanted a menu. I told her no thank you but I would like to buy a $100.00 gift cert.
I waited for a full 20 minutes before going back to the hostess and asking if there was somebody else that could help me. The hostess went back to the same lady behind the food bar, they both looked at me and the hostess went back to the front.
After another 10 minutes I again asked the food bar lady if I could get the certificate. She said, ""Oh, you want a gift certificate?"" After another 5 minutes she came back and told me the computers were down and I should come back later.
Food may be good, but the service, at least by the food bar server was horrible."
715,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I used to go to the original Hash House all the time and have missed it immensely.  So glad to have one in Vegas now!   

Hash was great!  Service was friendly, although a few minor holes.  

Portions were immense and tasty!   I made my meal 2 meals!"
716,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I really wasn't impressed with this place.

My group waited for almost 2 hours for a table (during which time we went from a group of 8 to a group of 4 - I stuck it out because my brother claimed it was amazing). After we FINALLY got a table, we waited about another 45 minutes for our food. 

It was so-so. My boyfriend and I split the chicken and waffles and, honestly, I've had better chicken and waffles at soooo many different places (Roscoe's, Gussie's, etc., etc.). I thought both the chicken and the waffles were REALLY dry, they didn't give us any syrup, it was hellish trying to get the waitress' attention to get drink refills... overall, I was just really disappointed because this place had been talked up to me so much. 

Also, I know the portions are huge, but I still felt like it was overpriced because the QUALITY was really sub-par.

I wouldn't talk this place up to anyone, nor would I come again on my own free will."
717,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had the smoked salmon mash which was pretty good, but not as smokey as I would have liked. The side of fruit was fresh and tasty.  We split a 14"" banana pancake which was heaven! We had enough leftover to munch of it throughout the day too. Our server was great!  
This is a very popular place, and they have a lot of TV's plus music, so be prepared for a loud environment with lots going on."
718,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Every time I go it's fabulous! The food is fantastic, the service equally great and the ambiance is great! Can't wait to go back!!!"
719,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions- lost a star because my mixed drink was a very light pour. Food was good though
720,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portions are humongous. The price matches the portions, so it's reasonable, however unless you want to share or split your meal into 2, it's just too much food! I got chicken and waffles, which was $21, which I probably rather pay $11.50 for half the amount & would be happy. 
The food was good. Waffles were fluffy and the chicken was tastey crunchy with a moist inside.

Clean and great attentive service. 

We arrived to this location around 3:30am after Drai's night club and had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. It wasn't packed, but I suppose they don't have a number of staff throughout the night during the week. 

So, I only finished less than half of my meal (of course) and ended up bringing it home. It was not good as leftovers... I would only recommend fresh and eating it at the restaurant."
721,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent service easy listening music large portions comfortable seating. Convient location. Reasonable prices you get way more than what you pay for. I would definitely come back and bring friends. Awesome place
722,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The Breakfast was very good, however, literally the worst service I have ever had.  After waiting at our table for one hour, the server tried to con us into believing the kitchen had screwed up, but he needed to ""retake"" our order.  He then tried to explain how he miraculously was able to get us free drinks for our trouble.  Wow.  Would not repeat."
723,Hash House A Go Go,5,I had their Griddle French toast with banana! It was soo good! It has a whole fried banana on top! It came with three giant French toast! It also had pecans on top. Def recommend trying these out! One of the best French toast I've ever had!  I didn't finish it all because it was so much food!!
724,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was recommended to us by a friend and I have to say it was some of the best food I have had in a long time.
Great service, prices are really reasonable,especially if you see the portion size.....huge plus some more .....delicious from beginning to end. 
Great service, waitress was really friendly .
All in all awesome from beginning to end.....going back next weekend :)"
725,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food is incredible and a must try for all brunch freaks! Located inside the Linq on the second floor ( signs above guide you to this gem) I would recommend arriving early to snag a table before the crowds blast in. 
I got there about 9 and was seated immediately. Ordered their top 3 plates, the highlight for me was their brown sugar banana pancake which hit all the right notes.. it was so damn good I went back the next day for another... yea, that good! 
The service was spot on, attentive yet not inclusive. Delicious"
726,Hash House A Go Go,5,We order the meatloaf hash and the farm tracker! The waiter was good and the food was great!
727,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Our go to breakfast joint in Vegas. Open 24hours. Portions are huge!!! We got to go once and fed a family of five with 2 entrees. Lol. So good. 

Great vegetarian options."
728,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hated it. Even after a 45 min wait for a table, we had to wait an hour for the food. This is no joke. And it wasn't just us it happened to this is the norm. Food not so great.  It was equivalent to Dennys. Sorry but that's the truth!!!"
729,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Located inside the LINQ is the perfect stop for breakfast after a night out on the strip.  They have plenty of menu options.  My FiancÃ© had the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffle Tower which is his go to choice every time we go there.  I am a fan of their Griddled French Toast with banana, cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup.  The service can sometimes be hit and miss.  They are usually pretty busy so be prepared for a wait but it is worth it."
730,Hash House A Go Go,4,"What a great place to go for breakfast while in Las Vegas.  You can also have lunch or brunch.  Whatever tickles your fancy.  
Drinks are a must 
As well as their pancakes, eggs Benedict 
Very busy but restaurant is huge and the wait is not so bad.  Just think your opening up your appetite while you wait to be seated."
731,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Long wait on weekend mornings.  Location is VERY noisy so don't plan to have a discussion.  Food was very good,  could not eat it all.  Wait staff was good"
732,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The original one in San Diego is way better than the one in the quad.   The food wasn't very good at this one especially, the pancake I had and the eggs were over cooked.  Tried something different had the tractor plate thing and I will not have that, again that, is for sure.  This place is dirty compared to other ones and the staff is rude."
733,Hash House A Go Go,5,The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is possibly the best breakfast in Vegas. It's reasonably priced and I always have leftovers.
734,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Over hyped, mediocre food......but a lot of it."
735,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was wonderful and the portions were enough for two. Great service and atmosphere. The only criticism is that it was very loud, hard to have a conversation and hard to hear the servers."
736,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place had some serious 5-star food and 1-star service.

I needed some breakfast in a bad way, as one often does in Vegas and reluctantly agreed to wait a half hour for a seat because I am an advertiser's dream and Adam Richman likes the place so I am all over it. 

I lived in Vegas for nearly a whole year (which is something like 6 years in Vegas time) and usually know better that to eat in a popular restaurant on the strip when avoidable but we were close and hungry.

We get seated and it takes about 10  minutes to get some coffee and another 10 after that to get water that was ordered at the same time. 

We order up some chicken and waffles with a side of biscuits and gravy. Hope fills my heart renewing my faith in a Man v Food destination (my lady wouldn't let me eat the 6 lb burrito at The Sahara but for the record I would've killed it).

30 MINUTE LATER...I see our food come out of the kitchen...and...head straight to a different table...We try to flag down the guy bringing it out as the table tells him yes they ordered chicken and waffles but not biscuits and gravy but before we can get his attention he drops the chicken and goes back to the kitchen with the biscuits. 

Add 20 minutes to that and they manage to sort out what has happened (try getting a server's attention in that time) and we get an apology and finally a coffee refill. Keep in mind tht the table who got our food had another order for the lady and she had to watch her man eat for the 20 minutes before her food came out.

I will give them this...the food was orgasmic. ORGASMIC. the chicken was amazing and the waffles had friggin' bacon cooked right into it. Right into it! The biscuits and gravy were omgnom or whatever the kids are saying these days.

I would go here again but probably stick to my instinct and make my way to the one off the strip."
737,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Nothing for you with allergies. 
I will call this a fast food restaurant. If you want to have junk and fatty food this is the place for you. Have the chicken waffles. It's definitely something you should try once and this is the place to do that."
738,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was the best breakfast I have had in Vegas and I am definitely a breakfast person. I had the smallest on the menu the 2 egg breakfast it was so good! My hubby had corned beef hash, he  said it was good too. We waited 30 minutes and that was at 8 am..."
739,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This was a great start to our trip with brunch at Hash House a go go. I want to give this place 3.5 starts. Lets start with good things:
-Bloody Mary was good and you can sip on one while waiting for your table. 
-The bacon mashed potatoes that came with my meal
-The biscuit was the most wonderful thing I have ever eaten. So light and fluffy. You could see the layers. I want to sleep in one of these. 
-The portions-humongous! Easily sharable by 2. Don't be like us and waste food. 
-If i heard my friends right, there is bacon in the waffle mix. 

The ""could be better""
-A charge for a side of ranch? really? I didn't ask for a bucket and my meal isn't $3.99. You can give me complimentary ranch if I ask. 
-Food took forever. When we asked our waitress..she said yeah we have 100 tables. Set this expectation when people order and don't be snarky. 
-Too much food? LOL
-When giving people change, don't give ripped up bills. It's easier for a business to cash these than people."
740,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Large portions of crappy food at high prices

Greasy, heavy, commercial breakfast.

I'm adding in This was at the Rio, giving the benefit to the doubt of the others in their chain."
741,Hash House A Go Go,5,Always a must to come to when visiting. Bring an appetite  or someone else to share your meal with. Excellent choice for a small or large family to visit. 5 thumbs up
742,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is the best!! I came here for some much needed breakfast and man was I not prepared. The portions are seriously huge!!! Seriously did not need to eat for the rest of the day.It was great!! The service was awesome. Will definitely eat here again!!
743,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Portions are huge.  I think when food is cooked this big, the quality suffers."
744,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions. Really... We shared chicken Benedict and probably had enough leftover for another person. But delicious and Well worth the wait. Great, friendly service."
745,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The service here blew me away. The best service I received during my entire stay in Vegas. 

The food is great, your standard all american restaurant. Yes, there will be a wait, but if you don't want to wait, don't go. We went with a kid and they had a real kids menu.

Despite the name HASH they do not serve hash browns. You've been warned.

Large portions and good service make this the best value on the strip."
746,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is delicious and their portions are outrageous! My husband and I split a plate of food and still couldn't finish it. Their potatoes are on point!
747,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Beware of the gigantic portion when you come here, a pancakes are bigger than your face. Food tastes flavorful overall."
748,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Located in the Linq Casino, is the Hash House A Go Go...  A place where you will endure a wait time equal to the time you will wait at the DMV, so be prepared to do a lot of standing if you can't find one of their 20 or so spots to sit.  Bottom line, this place gets PACKED!  We were told a table for 2 would be a 45-60 minute wait, but it wasn't that long, probably 30ish minutes, so not that bad, but if you come with a group, you'll be waiting much, much longer during peak meal times.  Once sat, we were greeted very quickly and noticed the meals coming out were HUGE!!!  You will not leave this place hungry!  This is where I am stuck between 3 and 4 stars, so let me get to what we ordered and my druthers next.   My wife ordered their Crab Cake Farm Benedict and like I said, the portion was enough to feed a small army, served over a mountain of griddled mashed potatoes and a split biscuit, with fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chipotle cream and two basted eggs.  I ordered one of their, what I assume is a signature meal of theirs, House Hashes, served with Corned Beef, red onions, and Swiss cheese; tossed with crispy potatoes & topped with 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit.  Both portions were too much to finish.

Now, this is why I give three stars..  It took forever to get our food.  I know it's busy, but we waited close to 30 minutes before our food was brought to us.  The crab cake on my wife's meal was not hot at all.  My ""crispy potatoes"" were no where's near crispy and again, not very hot.  The presentation of the meals was very good, but would have been much better if they were served hot.  You are also sort of ""rushed"", as you're given your bill well before you're even close to be done with your food.  One table I observed was even asked if they were done with their food when it was pretty obvious, they weren't close and still had their forks in their hands!  Let me end this rant by saying our server was very pleasant and courteous.   

All meals served here will make you add a notch to your belt and if you leave here hungry, something is terribly wrong with your appetite.  The prices are a bit on the higher side than you'd expect to pay for breakfast, but they make up for that in the amount of food you get.  It's a check in the box, and don't think we'd be back, but the food, if served hot and fresh, is very good - just get ready to make breakfast a 90+ minute ordeal."
749,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've been to both the Vegas and San Diego locations and while they're both wicked, I think the Vegas one is slightly  better. In either city you really can't go wrong with Hash House. Food is fresh and flavorful - portions are HUGE! Always a great meal although now I want to waddle right back to bed."
750,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and huge portions. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas. The breakfast is amazing. The orange juice also taste great. The server we had was really nice and made great recommendations about what to taste in the menu. The meals can be shared by two, unless your really hungry!!! I recommend the chorizo plate!!!"
751,Hash House A Go Go,4,"THIS PLACE. Is so good. We were told that for the 3 of us, we would have a 25 minute wait, but the wait only ended up being less then 5 minutes, so that was pretty cool! 

Service: Had great service, despite the fact that they were really busy, he was very attentive with refills on my water and my parent's drinks as well. Was super nice about switching out my wheat toast for dry wheat toast because the one that came out had WAY too much butter on it. 

Food: I had an egg white scramble with smoked salmon & spinach with a side of fruit. The egg white scramble was SO good, It had some herbs in it as well, and I couldn't put my finger on what they were but all I know is that it was delicious. My parents both got different scrambles and they enjoyed theirs as well. Everything I tried didn't disappoint by any means. I saw so many people ordering the chicken and waffles! That's probably one of their most popular items. They also have amazing-sounding pancake selections. Basically every description on the menu sounded good. 

Atmosphere: Pretty loud, and very fast-paced, but really cool. 

I would definitely come back."
752,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must while in Vegas. The portions are huge so go hungry. We waited awhile to get in, but I think that's the standard there. They moved the line really quickly and the staff was really pleasant and helpful. I got the bacon avocado scramble and my friend got Andy's Sage Fried Chicken."
753,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing breakfast. Had to wait a bit, but that's to be expected in Vegas. The wait was worth it. The portions are huge. My wife and I split the chicken and waffles. They were outstanding. The service was great even though they were packed. Will definitely return."
754,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A good place to grab brunch/lunch on the strip. The food is pretty good and it's reasonably priced. The portions are HUGE, so split with a friend. I was here alone, and had to leave a large portion of my roasted chicken hash behind. The stuffed burgers are as monstrous. There can be a bit of a wait, even when there are empty seats. I'm guessing the reason is that the kitchen can only handle so much at a time. In fact, I was seated at a huge booth within 10 min and my section was pretty much empty, but the waiter did warn me that there is a delay in the kitchen.
Wouldn't go out of the way to go to this place, but if you're in the area it's definitely decent"
755,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place rocks.

Not only are the portions big, bordering on glutenous, but the food is outstanding. Sage chicken is awesome. We had heard about this place from several people but never had a chance to try in past Vegas trips. This time we stayed at the Linq (hotel sucked) so were right there for breakfast. despite the long line we decided to try it anyway. We ended up eating there every morning. 

Our friends love it, we loved it, you will leave full, fat and happy... Nuff said."
756,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Desperate for a sizeable breakfast and grazing like cattle at a buffet is not an option for me.  A taxi driver recommendation for Hash house was spot on.  I was solo and saw the large crowd even at 7:30 so I took a seat at the bar.  The oversize and somewhat intimidating portion of biscuits, eggs, bacon, and gravy was more that just big.  It was delicious!"
757,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best American breakfast
The portions are enormous
If you like to eat this is the place.
I never usually go to the same restaurant when I travel  but I am returning today I am curios to try other plates"
758,Hash House A Go Go,3,I had the Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict. It was alot of food. This meal featured on Man vs. Food. It's alot of food for one. The taste was just average. Nothing exciting about it. If you put the fried chicken from Bruxie it would be amazing.  No fried chicken compares to Bruxie. Sorry Hash.
759,Hash House A Go Go,2,If you are planning to go here due to the awesome experience you've had at the San Diego location then DON'T DO IT! it'll totally ruin your fond tasteful memories of this place. This location does not have the same stuff on the menu. No strawberry mimosa?! super weak! the presentation of the food was awful. The 5 hostesses were pretty unorganized. It started off on a bad note and definitely ended on a bad note.
760,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First time in Las Vegas, and was craving some delicious food late at night (3 am). Remembered hearing about seeing this place on Man vs Food, so decided to give it a shot. Had the sage fried chicken, as shown on man vs Food. One word. Wow. After an 8 mile spartan race, this was the PERFECT meal to reenergize. The chicken was so delicious and moist. The eggs underneath were so tasty. The melted cheese was my absolute favorite part. And the mashed potatoes were soo good. They also had somewhat of an enchilada sauce drizzled around the side of the plate, which was a good little addition. Mix everything together, with a touch of the sauce, and you've got yourself one of the most tasteful things ever. The plate was HUGE. Even being from Texas, where portions are always big, I was very surprised by how large this meal was. Any place where I can't finish the whole plate (and I eat ALOT) has my 5 star vote. Waiter was also very nice and had great customer service. Try this place!!"
761,Hash House A Go Go,5,My fiance and I looked for good breakfast spots for our recent trip to Las Vegas as we hadn't been there.  We stumbled on this place and omg!! Am I glad we did. The food was awesome and the portions were huge. We shared a plate of chicken and waffles and were full. Can't wait to go back on our next trip to Vegas!
762,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you want over the top delicious brunch food, you have to go to the Hash House at the Linq!

We orders the banana dipped French toast and the Sage Chicken Benedict. We had to switch plates back and forth because they were both so delicious it felt like a race!

The sage chicken Benedict was definitely my favorite. Normally, when you order a multi-layer mountain of binge worthy food - the quality of each individual piece it's at its best but here it's the opposite! The chicken was moist and juicy, the breeding was crispy and flavorful with sage and sweet salty crunch. Every ingredient was the best quality: mashed potatoes so flavorful, biscuits buttery and melt in your mouth, fluffy scrambled eggs, thick bacon well done, and the chipotle sauce was to die for!! 

Go here now!"
763,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Was hella excited to hit Hash House A Go Go after a drunken Friday night in Vegas! It's open 24hours (limited menu after hours but still a great selection) and the food looked super good online as well as the reviews. Okay, so here's the experience. We were seated right away. Our first waiter was very nice and suggested the best dishes to choose from. Based on his highly rated suggestions we ordered a #2 stuffed burger and their famous eggs Benedict that was on Man vs Food. I enjoyed the seasoned fries that came with the burger. The burger patties were dry and bland. The eggs Benedict looked like a mound of dog food covered in Thousand Island dressing. tasted like it too. Inedible to me. First waiter was replaced by an inattentive 2nd waiter who was only present to quickly bring the check and rush us to pay with a handheld credit card processor. He stood there and watched as I was under pressure to choose a tip for him that was well deserved for our original waiter. Anyway $40 later... we were left overstuffed and dissatisfied wishing we had went to In and Out instead."
764,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Heard good things about this place, but the portions are way too big.  The sage fried chicken and waffles were good.  Just too much for one person and you will get tired of it.  We got here early so there was no wait, but the waiter looked flustered when they were still slow.  Messed up my friends order 3 time...."
765,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Porcion gigante, la compartimos mi esposo y yo. Muy buena combinacion de sabores.
El tiempo de espera para mesa era de 25 minutos. Por tanto nos sentamos en la barra y fuimos atendidos de inmediato. La comida llego en menos de 20 min."
766,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Great restaurant, love the concept, I always eat here while in Las Vegas. Having said that the service suffers because the restaurant is so popular & crowded. Wait times of over an hour are common, when you are seated and have ordered, the wait time between placing your order and being served your food is ridiculous. Sunday morning our party of 3 waited 48 minutes. This morning (Monday) I waited 52 mins..... for a grilled cheese sandwich no less! Very disappointing service."
767,Hash House A Go Go,5,Always amazing!  Portobello mushroom sandwich and strawberry shortcake were delicious.  The Portobello sandwich is likely the smallest item on the menu.  Both items were shared so I didn't have to waddle out!
768,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went there for brunch with my wife, had about a 30 min wait. Once we got seated or server was awesome and friendly. I had the chicken Benedict and my wife had the chorizo scrambler. Both were good, however, the sage chicken covered in sauce is really the way to go, bring your appetite!"
769,Hash House A Go Go,4,"An extra star for the novelty value. This place has an awesome menu that gives American comfort food a sophisticated twist. The food here is good, not great but the appeal is the insanely HUGE portions. This is definitely a place to try at least once, just to see the unreal tower of food.

Tourist tip...these portions are so big there is no way you will come close to finishing it. Unless you don't wind throwing away uneaten food, I would share entrees. This is not the kind of food that you can take back to your hotel. Don't be that guy that stinks up the entire floor of your hotel with the nasty smell of your leftovers, which you probably wont even eat."
770,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was staying in the hotel and wanted to do a pick up order.  When I called down, they told me I would have to come in and order at the bar.  I schlepped down and ordered the meatloaf sandwich with SP fries.  The bartender was nice but didn't offer me so much as a glass of water while I waited.  It was timely coming out, but the fries were soggy and the sandwich was meh.  For nearly $20, I was hoping for a bit more.  Oh well."
771,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow this is how pancakes should be served. Sized as a hubcap of a car. Mine had banana and brown sugar mixed into it. Also a side of bacon, done close to crispy. Man I'm hungry again lol. It was inside the Linq second floor. Expensive, but hey its Vegas, so to be expected. This is a must for all breakfast and or brunch lovers when in town. Friendly waitstaff as well. Well done Hash A Go Go will definitely be back."
772,Hash House A Go Go,5,My second time here and both Meal's exceeded my expectations. Today I had the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs and a biscuit. Everything was cooked perfectly. The service was also very attentive.
773,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My hubby and I went here for breakfast this morning and I'm so glad we did. It was AMAZING! There is one in San Diego too which makes me happy because it's close to us. So anyways first and foremost the food was amazing, huge portions but very tasty. I had the egg and pancake. I got the blackberry granola pancake it was delish. My hubby had the original corn beef hash. He said everything was too good for words. 

Secondly the service was 5 star rating. Our waitress was great. She was attentive but not intrusive. Very helpful with menu selections. And most importantly very helpful with a good pour of coffee. 

Would I come back? You betcha!! 

Sorry about that but I'm in Vegas."
774,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Loved this place!

Great service, HUGE portions.  Unusual menu selections - the smoked salmon benedict with chili cream sauce was delish!

Liked it so much I bought the tee shirt!"
775,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Bloody Mary's are a great way to start the day.  I ordered chorizo and eggs on a skillet with potatoes and typical Mex toppings... so tasty!  The portions were outrageous if you like that sort of thing. I couldn't finish my brunch but the Bloody Mary May have had something to do with it.  Wait time wasn't too bad considering what the restaurant had to offer - either way, it was worth it!"
776,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So amazing!! Loved this place. Got there just in time before the MASSIVE wait for a table and enjoyed their famous sage chicken & bacon waffles. Seriously the best EVER! My first chicken & waffle experience and it was so totally worth it. There was no way I could finish (or even really make a dent - wish they would offer a 'half portion' of this amazing masterpiece). Perfect for after a night of ""vegas"", if you know what I mean...
All the servers and staff were super friendly. The drinks took a little long, but as I mentioned, it was a busy morning (Jan 1st...). Everyone worked really quickly & well together. The bussers were on point and we were well taken care of. Would definitely recommend!"
777,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Overrated is not the word for it.  Lots of empty calories is not what I am opposed to. It has to be worth it, good, comforting, fun.  It was none of these.  There are better options in LV."
778,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This was our first time visiting this establishment and was thoroughly surprised! In such a busy place, it was amazing how nice and attentive the staff was. The wait was insane so we chose to sit at the bar. Our bartender was great as she made excellent drink and food suggestions.  We were astonished when the food came out and the portions were ENORMOUS! Definitely too much for one person to eat so would recommend sharing a plate. Definitely worth trying while visiting Vegas!"
779,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HOLY COW---- what can I saw- this place rocks. BUSY busy busy.... get there on time, otherwise you will be there waiting for sometime (specially on the weekends). This is our Sunday's ""goodbye sin city"" breakfast place. You can share a plate with 2 people or unless  you are really hungry- have it. 
The chicken fried Benedict was really flavorful. My friend had the chicken and waffles and we were just in heaven. Aside from curing our hangover---- the meal took us to another level of food coma- we had to sleep for another few hours before hitting the road back home. 
THIS PLACE IS A MUST!!!!"
780,Hash House A Go Go,3,Delicious but overrated IMO. They only thing unique about this place is it's presentation and oversized dishes. I'd rather go to something like that breakfast place in Encino (name escapes me).
781,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Though the wait time can vary - I did not mind the 50-minute wait on a Saturday afternoon (2pm) because of nearby distractions (slot machines!) 

Food is cooked to order so try to order your drinks and food together to get it started.  All entrees were large portions where two or three can share. Alcohol drinks can be taken to go! (new for me cause in CA we cant do that!) lol! 

Recommendations: BLT Mary, Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles :)"
782,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yum we ate breakfast every morning and the line was out the door. Food was awesome and you can skip the line if you are a diamond member of total rewards
783,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I went here a while ago, but never got around to writing a review. I ended up here after late at night after me and a friend tried to eat at another place but they had horrible service and we wanted over thirty minutes for an appetizer that the waitress forgot to order. I wasn't a fan of the limited menu for late night, but I settled on a burger which was good, but huge. I haven't been back, but that's not because the food wasn't good."
784,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Absolutely my favorite foody spot in vegas! The girls & i decided to come here because of previous friends who have visited all said that this was the place to go! Boy, they were so right! We came here after the nightclub due to the fact that they are really busy during lunch time & were packed but since they are open 24/7 we came late night. 
We were told that two plates were they most well known plates that were famous so of course me & the girls decided to get our own plate. (Andy's Sage fried chicken, Chicken & waffles, & corned beef hash) Our server warned us before ordering that one pate is enough share for the three of us but we were hungry & were careless of what she said. Few moments later when the food arrived we all looked at each other & said she was right we should have ordered only two plates. Several spoon fulls later we were so stuffed & barely even put a dent on our plates!
The service was great! but what was even better was the food (quality & taste)! Our bill was nothing compared to the buffet prices too! You really do get a bang for your buck here! I promise you, you will leave feeling fully satisfied & taste buds feeling tingly from the rich sauces & ingredients. We left here fully satisfied & our tummy's full! I will be making sure to stop by here every time we hit up vegas!"
785,Hash House A Go Go,4,It was my first time eating at Hash House at this location. Everything was great. Our waitress Bri was attentive and friendly. Our drinks were always full and the food came out in a timely manner. There was five of us for a Bachelorette brunch and I expected it would take a lot longer for the food but we waited no more than 20 minutes. I ordered the French Toast and it tasted amazing! Another great thing about this location is that they're open 24 hours. I will be coming back. Great food with great service.
786,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So, it's not the best fried chicken I've ever tasted (Mom gets that award,) but it's pretty good. It's on the sweet side, so it's definitely something different and I enjoyed it. I don't think it would be the perfect fried chicken to enjoy with their chicken n waffles, because ideally you want to mix the sweet and the salty, not the sweet and the sweet. I took my grand-niece here, it seemed like a fun place to go with a college student, and she seemed to enjoy it for the 5 minutes in which she wasn't texting someone on her smart phone. The service was great, very fast, and if you want to treat a college kid to something they will enjoy, without spending too much, it's a good call."
787,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for breakfast after being up all night. It must've been somewhere between 5 and 6, but who's keeping track of time? 

I will start off by saying the food was a definite 5 stars. The portions are HUGE and all the food is delicious. I got some type of corned beef breakfast and my friends got some other amazing dishes. Definitely worth the price and a great find on the strip. 

The only downfall was the service, which is why I have it 4 stars. Our server was actually really nice, but everything seemed to lag and take a long time. We got in when it was pretty empty, so not exactly sure what was going on. I will definitely be going back here anytime I'm in LV!"
788,Hash House A Go Go,4,"IF you have to read anything in this review, you must heed my advice: order, gamble, steal, and/or whore yourself out to try the brown sugar pancake/flapjack.  Gather the crumbs off of another table's leftover pancake if you have to.  Nike.  I mean, just do it.

I would have given this review a 5 (the pancake gets a 5) but I did find some draw backs.  The roasted chicken hash deserves a 2 as the seasoning was salty and the chicken was dry.  The few benedicts that I have tried are at least a 3 star rating, but their portions in general deserve a 5.  Come hungry."
789,Hash House A Go Go,4,"BIG portions of comfort food!  Well presented, with good service. Have been there several times. Never disappointed. 

Best breakfast on the strip?   
Could be.  Haven't found anything better."
790,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Long waits, gargantuan food servings, like offensively large and don't try to finish.  I went with the Sage Fried Chicken benedict, and I ate about 1/4 of it.  The large sprig of sage impaling the dish was quite nice but the queso cheese was dried to a point of rubbery texture and just not edible.  The service was top notch though, quite friendly. I may be a bit picky as my fellow diners at my table ate most of their meals and loved it, but I'll let them write their own reviews."
791,Hash House A Go Go,5,Everything was AWSOME. I got the famous chicken and waffles with a Bloody Mary. I was so stuffed after half of this giant portion but I just couldn't stop eating and forced myself to keep going. Prices were reasonable compared to most places around. I will return and would recommend to anyone.
792,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Extremely slow, we went here for my friends birthday before a show. We gave ourselves 2 hours before we had to leave. Only waited 15 minutes to sit, but took another 10 minutes to even have someone make eye contact with us. Not what we expected for the price of the food.  

We were almost late to our show...very disappointed...the Hash House A Go Go in the M casino was much faster, and the staff were a lot more friendly."
793,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I really don't understand the hype about this place...we came around 8am and there was no line (although we did wait 10 minutes for them to set up the tables), and by 9:30am there was a looooooonnggggg line. 9:30am is still extremely early for Vegas...I can't imagine what the line would be like a little later when the rest of Vegas wakes up. 

We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken with Biscuits and Blueberry Pancakes. First of all, holy moly...the fried chicken dish was GINORMOUS! I suggest sharing this between 3 people because trust me, two people can't finish this unless you had a big appetite. This dish was just too heavy...the gravy and the potatoes and fried chicken is actually really overwhelming, lol. The blueberry pancakes were standard...I mean they were good but they weren't super fluffy or anything, there's nothing special about them. 

Overall I was pretty disappointed with Hash House A Go Go. There are definitely better breakfast/brunch places on the Strip."
794,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've been here several times and am just getting around to writing a review because I recently went during my annual Vegas trip with my mom.  I've been wanting to bring her here because she loves to eat and hasn't tried anything like this before.  Needless to say she was pleasantly surprised.  Every time I come here, I usually get the sage fried chicken and waffle but I just determined that I don't like the sage too much and the chicken in my opinion is a little too greasy and makes my tummy hurt.  

I got that for myself and my mom got the deep fried pork loin benedict dish. I'm not sure the official name for it was but it was wayyyy better than the sage fried chicken and waffle. I would highly recommend that!!  Portions are hugggggge and a dish can be shared among 2-3 people or saved for left overs. Totally worth the price and so so so yummy!!  I will be back again to try something new!"
795,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food portions are huge so come very hungry or share! The bacon is thick cut and crispy. The berry pancake was so delicious!
796,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came here on the last day of our weekend,The wait was about 40 minutes but as soon as we were being seated I heard them quoting to people it was at an hour and a half so I advise to come early. They were  selling mimosas and bloody Mary's while we waited. It was  $9 for a mimosa and it was small and weak so I took a star off for that. I got the bacon avocado farm scramble which was delicious. It came with a half platter of potatoes and a biscuit. The biscuit was ok but the potatoes were amazing. My friend got a BBLT and the sandwich was bigger than her face and stuffed to the max with thick strips of bacon. The service was a little slow but they were packed so I'm sure the kitchen was backed up. I'll be back for sure next time I'm in Town!"
797,Hash House A Go Go,3,Huge portions but it looked better than it tasted. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffles were good but if I came back i would opt for no bacon in them.  The chicken was good however all the breading was cooked! The layer against the chicken was mushy and tasted uncooked.  My favorite part was the crispy green onions which they called leeks but the looked too small to be leeks.  My husband had a stuffed burger and I tried it. It was just ok. Nothing outstanding or memorable. I will say the fry seasoning was delish!!! I would go back and try an egg dish but if it fell flat too if never go back.
798,Hash House A Go Go,5,I have gone to Hash House off the Vegas strip a couple of times. This past time I brought my little sister to Vegas and had to take her here. They also just opened one on the strip at the Linq hotel. I always get the same thing Chicken and Waffles. When my little sister and I went we shared the plate. We went at 7:30am which is the sweet spot time. There was maybe a 10 min late but when we left the wait was about 45min which was around 8:30am. I'm telling you this place gets jammed packed so go at the right time. This was also my least expensive bill in our Vegas trip so it was worth it. Also right after we ate we played slot machines and won the dinner back so I was a happy happy camper.
799,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place it absolutely amazing! I will be making this a must stop every time I'm in Vegas! The food was absolutely amazing and such huge portions. My boyfriend and I were able to order one meal and what t cost us only $20 to eat there is a orange juice and it filled us up. If you're staying in the Linq hotel they do have refrigerator's for left overs.(; When we went there was a 45 mins wait at lunch time, we probably got seated around 25 mins, and we were very happy about that. This place was just wonderful, a Vegas must have, and I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"
800,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First time to hash house. Location seems very dark and stuffy but my husband really wanted to try it so I made the best of it. We ordered our food and it seriously took like 30/40 mins for our food to come. We noticed people that got sat after us we're getting there food before us. We ordered fried chicken and a chorizo hash nothing fancy so I was confused why it took so long. I know the server said everything's made from
Scratch which I'm happy about but why did people get food before me when I arrived before them. Not sure if that was the kitchen or our severs fault. Flavor was good nothing that would make me come back. Also there is no bathroom in the restaurant you have to go down stairs into the casino."
801,Hash House A Go Go,4,This is the place to go to if you're really hungry and haven't ate anything all day. Ridiculously enormous plates of good comfort food. We went there for brunch and it was a full house with an hour wait so be ready to wait in line or else check back during early morning or early afternoon as the crowd dies down after eating rush hours.
802,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had breakfast and dinner here. Service friendly. Restaurant clean.
 
BREAKFAST- Of course I had to have the Corned Beef Hash. It was not that good, surprisingly. It was dry.

DINNER- I had heard that the Hamburgers are good here. So I tried it... it was excellent. I started with a salad that only comes with cucumber dressing. It was very good. I ordered the Hamburger with a single patty, because I knew of the huge portions. Near perfect, quality beef, fresh baked buns, extra crispy fries."
803,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Saw it on Man v. Food and hunted it down when in Vegas for breakfast. There was a line, and for good reason. There is not a better breakfast in the country. Maybe the world. Or the universe. The Imperial Palace is a hole, but good lord, what a feast. Great drinks, original and cool menu. Prices were good, service was great, the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict were superlative. Fantastic. Heavenly. Enormous. My wife ordered blueberry oat pancakes and they were enormous and delicious. What a fantastic place."
804,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Overrated. I frequented this place several times before the remodel and it was good. Before, the wait was long but they got you in and out. This time the wait was long-but there were tons of empty tables. our waiter basically ignored us- it took nearly 20 mins for our food order to be taken. Our food when it did come was cold. And when our waiter did finally come to check on us, he dropped a plate onto our table. Nothing like having someone else's food scraps thrown at you!"
805,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Eat at both the new/old strip locations.  Atmosphere at the location in the link was so much better.  The food and drinks were delish.  Plan to share the hash, best thing on the menu.  The fried chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the spicy sauce was a perfect complement.  Love!!!"
806,Hash House A Go Go,2,"SERVICE - There was a good amount of people waiting around as we got there but the line moved fast and we waited for only 5 mins or so. Our server was great and gave a few pointers. Food took awhile to come out (I was on 2nd cup of coffee).

AMBIENCE - Very casual. The place was pretty big with a lot of tables and booths. However it was pretty dark in there and the decor was all metal and boring. 

FOOD - HUGE portions but lacking quality. Everything was good for sharing. Each entree can be shared between 2-3 people so better to come here as a group of 3 or more. 

[CRAB CAKE BENEDICT] - One giant crab cake which the fiance stated he could taste the freezer it came from :p LOTS & LOTS of unnecessary mashed potato which tasted pretty good at first but the sight of this huge pile was not appetizing... Overall a super carb-loaded entree with mediocre crab cake. The gravy and queso added good flavors but very heavy.

[BROWN SUGAR BANANA FLAPJACKS] - This is alright (even though our server described this as the ""best pancakes ever""...) I was full just by looking at it. Good for sharing for 4+ people."
807,Hash House A Go Go,2,I had to cancel dinner due to a migraine so I took a nap and woke up starving. Thankfully this place is open 24/7 and had ok reviews a but I mainly picked it because it was in our hotel and boo bear had to find me food. I got a burger stuffed with peppers and mozzarella it was alright but seriously guys sober people eat too and those fries are not edible. Massive grease for a restaurant that makes everything fresh. I was so hungry or I would have taken it back.
808,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Good food. Absurdly large portions. We came before the brunch rush so there wasn't a wait, but when we left it looked like a long line. 
We came with another couple. The 4 of us got our own breakfast and I ordered the bacon for the table, as well as a pancake. Big mistake. We didn't get the bacon so I can't speak to it. The pancake was delicious but the other meals were so large that the 4 of us didn't even eat half this cake. It is HUGE!  
I would say this gets 3 stars because the service was lacking- we only got refills once- and the food is just average. Definitely recommend trying it, but don't expect anything exceptionally tasty, unique, or full of flavor. Deliciously average."
809,Hash House A Go Go,1,I'm going with a single star here unfortunately 20 min wait turned into an hour wait to get our food what good is an open table if it takes them an hour to bring out a basic breakfast ? On top of that they forgot half my order .
810,Hash House A Go Go,3,It's not good as I expected:( kids meal were cheap and big portions. Only thing we liked was the waffles and fries  . Service was decent but I don't think I would eat here again . Sorry
811,Hash House A Go Go,5,By far one of the better places for your $ to eat on the strip. Great food even petter service. You'll have to wait but you'll wait everywhere in Vegas.
812,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I don't know what I can add to what's been said. Delicious food, in huge portions, in a clean and cheerful setting, with employees who appear to enjoy what they do. Reasonable prices. Long, long wait times to be seated, but they're honest with you up front with estimated wait times, and things move at a nice pace once you are seated. 

Five stars."
813,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love love love Hash House A Go Go but this location is just, okay. I always order the basic because it's simple and I know it's always going to be good. The wait staff were great but our food still came out cold and I wasn't sure why, our waiter didn't seem to be lingering or taking too long so, must've been something in the kitchen. 

There was a wait time even though when we got seated there were plenty of open tables, maybe they were planning something for the other half of the place :P"
814,Hash House A Go Go,3,so let me get this straight you can't add spinach to the farm house scramble but you there's spinach in the healthy start scramble??? that doesn't make any sense? and instead I asked the waiter if I can sub the mashed potatoes for fruit but he said no I could sub it for crispy potatoes... the whole point was I don't want potatoes... whatever this place in sure is good but if I can't get my pregnant cravings satisfied this place is just meehhh but dad likes the food tho hence the 3 stars otherwise I would've given this place 2 stars
815,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Not a big breakfast fan normally, but some of the dishes I have had heard are too amazing to pass up!  I have been here every time I go to Vegas and everyone I go with, or have recommended this place to, loves it.  I personally love the biscuits and gravy, but have also had the Man vs. Food dish, and that is huge and delicious.  Great food.  Perfect for your Vegas hangover."
816,Hash House A Go Go,5,We make it a point to come here every trip to Vegas. The food is amazing and in crazy huge portions. Look around while you wait to get seated or while seated to see the portion sizes brought to others so that you will believe me haha. Love it and will continue to come back
817,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were staying at the LINQ it was our first time since they remodeled. We got a really good deal on a room and we wanted some brunch so we came downstairs and there was about a 30 minute wait for the restaurant but I am a platinum total rewards member sooo guess what? NO WAIT! They seated us right away and we bypassed the wait! YES! I ordered their coffee, pumpkin pancake and their sage fried chicken benedict. which was HUGE! I loved their food and their portions are crazy which is the fun part. Their biscuits are bomb and so is their fried chicken. A great meal always"
818,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was pretty damn good and the portions enormous. I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the chicken was fried perfectly and the sauce was very creative and was a combination I never had.
819,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The absolute worst food experience of My life. The waiter ""forgot"" to put in our ticket an hour into our experience. Ok. Fine. Eventually, an hour later, our good finally arrived and was mediocre at best. Then we proceeded to endure an hour plus of fucking around by both the wait staff and the incompetent manager. We tried desperately to leave because it was 5am at this point. Overall the ending of our experience was horrible, lacking in any customer service, and a disservice to the restaurant"
820,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome food!! Had to laugh that they tote that they don't have microwaves and heat lamps. One of the best chicken salad sandwiches ever.
821,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Big portions of food. The food was great, the service was great. Expect long wait times to be seated for breakfast/brunch time at this location but it was worth the wait."
822,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Don't think you can finish a dish by yourself unless you're that guy from Man v. Food.  The serving sizes here are HUUUGE, unless you stick to side orders. 

On a Monday morning at 11am, our group of 4 waited about 45 minutes.  This restaurant is located inside the Linq Hotel (formerly Imperial Palace).  This place is massive as we walked through several rooms just to get to our seats. 

We started off with BLT Bloody Marys which were awesome!  I had to order the chicken and waffles since the display always looks so ridiculous in everyone's pictures.  It comes with 4 waffles (!!!) topped with sage fried chicken.  My boyfriend was smart went with the basic: two eggs, country potatoes, sausage, fruit, and biscuit.   Although it is very simple, you still get a lot but not as monstrous as the rest of their meals.  My friend ordered the salmon benedicts which came out as a mountain.  She didn't even eat a fourth. 

Quality of the food wasn't anything too fantastic, but the service was great.  I'm not sure if I would return, but if I ever do, I'll be sure to share my meal with someone else!"
823,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this place for the following reasons:

1. The food had NO flavor (my steak was underseasoned,  and OVER cooked, and the biscuit looked like it was steroids., as it was MASSIVE!! It was also dry, and flavorless.
2. It's OVERPRICED.
3. They value quantity over QUALITY. 

I'n short,  DON'T believe the hype, I could've easily gone to DENNY'S, ( down the Las Vegas strip) and gotten something comparable,  and paid MUCH less.
You've,  been WARNED"
824,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had been to the Chicago location, and wanted to visit.  Vegas is the perfect city to grab a giant breakfast anytime of the day.

I ordered a blueberry pancake - it was the size of a large pizza.  Despite my best efforts, I simply could not finish it.  All others in the party were equally pleased with the size of their meal!"
825,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I wouldn't have eaten here if not for diamond status, but I would have missed out. The wait is definitely worth it, the eggs Benedict crab cakes were worth cheating on my vegetarian diet! Mike was an amazing server, knowledgeable and friendly. If you're hungover and need some amazing brunch to fix it go to the hash house."
826,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Crab cake Benedict are my favorite, excellent. Place gets pretty busy for breakfast but they handle the crowd well."
827,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was soooo excited to eat here.  I had it on my list and was making sure I was not going to leave Vegas without trying it. It was easy to find.  Just head straight through the Imperial Palace until you hit the escalators.  We were are very hungry after a night of drinking and dancing and hoped to not have to wait too long to get seated.  It was pretty busy and also a Friday morning.  We were pleasantly surprised to get seated promptly in a nice comfy booth.  I ordered coffee and it came quick enough and was quite delicious.

One thing that stuck out in my mind as odd was the waiter told us right off the bat that the kitchen does not have any heat lamps, so the food is served out as soon as it's made. I thought OK, great, that means we will have our food quickly.  Eh, not so much.   Our food took a bit to come out.  It wasn't excessive but we definitely waited longer on our food than we did to get a seat.

Due to knowing the portion sizes are enormous we decided to split plates.  My dining partner and I chose the HH original Benedict.  It comes with bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, and is topped with a roasted red pepper cream as well as two eggs.  Additionally it sat on top of a split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. The potatoes reminded me of the potato pancakes my mom would make when I was a kid with leftover mashed potatoes-nice and golden browned and quite tasty. That was probably the best thing about the Benedict.  The bacon was good too, but hey it's bacon.

 Now for the not so good, the eggs were underdone and the parts of the white were still clear.  That kind of thing doesn't bother me, but I would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly.  The thing that was the biggest bummer was that the food was luke warm.  So I guess the no heat lamp thing doesn't necessarily work to their advantage because my food had to have sat back there for a bit before arriving to the table because it was not hot.  Also, the fresh tomato and spinach did not bring anything to the table.  Had the spinach been slightly sauteed or wilted and seasoned, it could have been a different story.  I think having those put on top of the Benny just made it even colder in temp.  Also, the whole thing was under-seasoned.  

The red pepper cream tasted like roasted red pepper bisque that was under-seasoned and cold.  I really do like the concept of having a Benedict topped with lighter ingredients and sauce, but it was all cold and under-seasoned and disappointing.  I kept going back to the bacon, egg and crispy mashed potatoes.  I will say that I was able to split this with another person and between the two of us couldn't even finish it.  Our bill came to $12 each, and I was very happy, and even though it was underwhelming, it was still worth it for the price.

My other friends ordered the Bananas Foster French toast-also huge, as well as the Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato and fresh spinach hash.  My friend did not like her hash at all.  I tried it and agreed with her that it was completely under-seasoned.  I hate having to add salt at a restaurant.  I think it should come out seasoned correctly.  Also the salt shaker had course salt in in that barely came out the holes in the shaker-a huge pet peeve of mine.  The bananas foster was huge but nothing out of this world.  What I did really like though was the split banana topped with sugar and bruleed.  It was so delicious and the banana developed a very creamy texture.  It was served still in the peel, which I thought was pretty cool.

Overall, the value is great, and the quality is also good.  I can only base this review on the one visit I made here, and there were definite flaws in the execution of the food.   Although the plates are huge, impressive looking, the taste is what matters most, and it unfortunately was lacking.  However, on a whole, due to the value of the food and he fact that one plate can be split between two people, I would like to go back and prove that Hash House can really live up to its hype."
828,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Yuuuukkkkkkk. Just yuk. Who wants pancakes bigger than your head? Nope, not me. Who wants drunk people at literally every single table. Nope, not a chance. 

We sat down at 7am when it was still a little quiet. And the only redeeming experience was Bri, the server, who was very polite. Around 730, this idiot guest came in and started talking to all the people around us, including shouting, ""what's up, fatty?!?"" to this guy who had just sat down. 

The reason its getting 3 stars is because the TASTE of the food wasn't bad and the server was nice. But, Never Again."
829,Hash House A Go Go,1,"NOPE!  I wouldn't come back even for a free meal.  Most bothersome is their lack of customer service.  Last week, we had the displeasure of being served by Kristin.  This place was recommended by a friend.  Since this was our first time, we had some questions about the menu which must have been the last straw on a bad day for our server as she became visibly annoyed at the questions and even plopped her hand down on the table to further showcase her frustration with the daunting task of having to explain a few menu items to the newcomers.  Yes, they offer ridiculously, glutton sized portions but for the cost, poor food quality and subpar service, you're really better off going somewhere else as Vegas offers way too many other options to end up settling for this place."
830,Hash House A Go Go,5,One of the best breakfast places in all of Vegas. Portions are huge and food is delicious. Well worth the wait.
831,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Dropped by for dinner Friday (11/28) night.  We were in Vegas for Thanksgiving last year so we ate at the Hash House a Go Go at the Plaza Hotel and everything was delicious.  We ordered the fried chicken salad which was so good and the BBQ chicken sandwich.  And, our waitress was super nice and very accommodating.  We will definitely be going back the next time we are in Vegas."
832,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First of all, I just don't see how my boyfriend lives in San Diego where the original Hash House started and has never been here. Shameful!

So I have had this on my bookmark list for a while and made it a point to eat breakfast here no matter the circumstance. The wait was not very long; we waited like 20 minutes for a table. Our order was immediately taken. I already knew from the reviews and our friends' personal experiences that we should probably share a meal. So we decided on the famous chicken and waffles...boy oh boy was that the most delicious thing I have ever had!! There was BACON in the waffle and both aspects were cooked to perfection!! How sway?!?!?! The chicken was moist and flavorful..almost like they slow cooked it because it kind of fell apart as you cut it. So very good. This meal kept me full for the rest of the day.

I will be back because I don't think any chicken and waffles I've had from ANYWHERE beats this!!"
833,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was recommended by the rental car people. The food was great. HUGE portions! The only downfall is that the there are no restrooms in the restaurant. You have to go onto the casino floor to find a restroom. Overall the food tastes good, portions are huge, enough to share. I'd definitely  go back to eat here."
834,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service was good, coffee was great. But why did I only give it 3 stars??? food was just average ol breakfast food. Anything special about that average ol breakfast? They put a partial branch of rosemary in ur biscuit for garnishment. Thats it.... 

Please note the food wasn't horrible.... it was edible but just very plain... nothing to get that excited about. If you are really hungry... prob not worth the wait time. Had higher expectations for as much hype as this place gets."
835,Hash House A Go Go,2,"O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D. 

Seriously? I mean, it was good for breakfast/brunch but it was NOT as amazing as everyone raves about. 

We waited about 45 minutes alongside every other person awake in Vegas at 9:00am on a Saturday. After we were finally seated (6 of us), we looked around at so many empty, clean tables! Very odd.

I ordered a scramble (came with a biscuit, melon slice, and potatoes) and the serving wasn't that incredible and I almost ate it all (I'm 110lb and petite). My potatoes weren't hot and my melon wasn't ripe. It just wasn't that impressive. The only thing I did enjoy was the coffee. Tasty coffee!

Overall--I would eat somewhere else or maybe visit the Hash House off the strip? Maybe Imperial Palace cramps its style."
836,Hash House A Go Go,4,WOW!!!! A friend recommended this place and I was a bit sceptical but I am REALLY happy my wife and I came here. The food was amazing and the portions were huge. I had the Fried Chicken and it was delicious! I need more time to work through this menu.
837,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I have eaten at Hash House several times, including the one in San Diego and the one off the strip.  I would say this one was really disappointing compared to them.  Something about this location, didn't have the feel of a true Hash House a go go.  It felt like I was in a old fashion diner and the food didn't quite taste the same.  The service was good, no complains there, it was the food that was the true let down.  We ordered the Sages Fried Chicken with waffles and biscuits and gravy.  Both dishes were just average.  The chicken was a little dry and the waffles were bland.  The gravy for the biscuits didnt taste very good either.  The portions were huge as expected, but we didn't eat half of our meals.  The quality just didn't seem there either.  Overall just a little disappointing, usually one of my favorite places to eat, just didn't deliver."
838,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yum, yum, yum.  If theres a wait... its worth the wait.  Great service... Scotty rocks!  Food was delicious.  Great portions and reasonably priced.  Quick tip... it's located inside the linq,  not out in the promenade."
839,Hash House A Go Go,5,"All the myths, rumors, and legends are true! This place is amazingly good! The chicken and Waffles, the banana cream French toast, and the morning adult beverages. Omgezzy!"
840,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow what a great place.  Ricky is a great resource for this place as a server. A pancake that is as big as an oversize plate and taste to match. Steel cut healthy delicious oatmeal and egg whites with spinach and fresh mushrooms. A trendy place to go on the Las Vegas Strip. The portions are out of this world, bring an appetite."
841,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Country style cooking with country style portions. What do I mean by that? The plate is overflowing. Drinks are delicious and refreshing. Inside and outside seating. Always busy. Sometimes you have to wait for 5-10min before being seated. Waiters and waitresses are welcoming and efficient. It's a little pricy, but based on the portions it's worth it."
842,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was average/good, but extra star for great service. The waiter patiently answered all our questions and didn't charge us a split plate fee. Drink were refilled without asking and food wasn't too long of a wait. Reasonable prices for a Strip restaurant with huge portions. 

I tried the fried chicken, which was tender but had a little too heavy on the breading for my liking. Apple cinnamon pancake was decent (one huge pancake), good butter and syrup. I liked the crispy potatoes much more than the mashed, although the latter was surprisingly flavorful. Biscuit was big, but the exterior too crisp...came with a nice light jelly. The chicken hash was blah. 

I went for Monday breakfast (around 10) and there were quite a few people waiting. Was quoted 25 minutes for my party of five, but only ended up waiting for like 10 minutes. Almost didn't get seated because one of our party wasn't there (warning because I couldn't get cell reception in the restaurant). On the way out, the line was huge!"
843,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is excellent. I had the chicken and waffles. The portions were huge! Two chicken breasts and four thick waffles The chicken was crispy and juicy. The waffles were tasty. Crisp on the outside and cakey on the inside. If some people don't like the waffles I think it's because they don't realize the waffles should be crispy and not spongy like most diner and frozen waffles are. Also people that say the waffles are tough may not realize that there is a piece of thick cut bacon baked into the waffle. The maple reduction is good but I would have liked a little more. I did ask for additional syrup. I also sampled the chorizo jalepeno scramble. The eggs were fluffy and the chorizo was nice and spicy. The potatoes were well cooked and tasty. The biscuit was little dry and could have used some butter or jelly.

The issue was with the service. Our wait for table was only five minute but I can see how at peak hours it's much longer. Our server took our orders very quickly and brought us drinks right away, however, it took a while to get refills. It did take a while for our food to come out and when it did the scramble was brought out about five minutes before the two orders of chicken and waffles. I hope this was due to the busyness of the restaurant and the fact the food was clearly prepared fresh. It was worth the wait."
844,Hash House A Go Go,2,"More like Hash House a No Go.
I expected a lot from this restaurant, because up to this point, I had enjoyed all of the restaurants on the strip that I had been finding using Yelp. I trusted the reviews. That's why I left more disappointed than usual.
The portions here are, for lack of a better word, revolting. Even an entree that is seemingly for a single person is still just a little too much food for a couple.
Perhaps this wouldn't be as bad if I didn't look out and see all of the food that was wasted at each table during the course of our meal. People ordered one entree each, leaving entire plates untouched because they either didn't like the food or couldn't finish it.
Most likely, they didn't like it. My boyfriend and I shared the Andy's Fried Chicken special, and it came with a heaping amount of sauce, covering a huge piece of oddly fried chicken, a huge biscuit, and a small mound of hash browns. It didn't look appetizing--it looked like someone had thrown up on what our order was perhaps supposed to look like. To make matters worse, they tried to decorate the plate by sticking what we could only guess were uncooked noodles--yes, uncooked pieces of wheat spaghetti--into various holes, sticking rosemary in the top, and dropping spots of a liquid (with the color and consistency of grease) around the rim of the plate.
WTF
We pulled out all of the needless 'decor' and tried to enjoy our meal, but we couldn't. The chicken breading tasted and felt weird, and it was probably over-fried. The biscuit was a little dry, but probably one of the least disappointing aspects of this entree. It also came with hash browns and a few pieces of fruit, which was definitely the least disappointing. 
Hash browns must be the only thing they are good at making, hence their name."
845,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Hash house A Go Go is one of our all time favs! We went here for lunch today and had the worst experience. The service was horrible, the drinks took almost 30 minutes and the food almost an hour. Server was never around or came by to check on us or apologize for wait. Victor was our server who had the worst customer service. My husband and I are both servers and both disappointed. We sympathize with busy kitchens and long waits but Victors attitude sucked. He could care less and was so rude. Won't be back."
846,Hash House A Go Go,2,"So this was our second time at the Vegas Hash House.  The Reno one seemed so much better.  We had a party of 6, which was a 50 minute wait.  The place is LOUD, you have to yell to hear the person next to you.  I wasn't hung over, but it was just plain irritating.  Our server was friendly, but not on-the-ball.  It took a while for her to get our order, which normally is okay, but we were dining with two small children.  What really knocked down my rating was the delivery of the food.  One friend got her meal first, along with one child, mine came about 5 minutes later, our other friends, probably 10 minutes later, and my husband, well, the person who got her food first was nearly finished by the time his arrived.  The server explained that they made everything fresh to order, so it didn't come out together. Uh, UNACCEPTABLE.  You're left to want to dive into the food, after waiting a ridiculous amount of time for it, and not wanting to be rude and waiting until everyone is served.  Not cool.  

The food itself was terrible.  I had the biscuits and gravy, the sausage was pink.  I didn't feel like waiting 2 more hours for food, so I picked around it.  The gravy tasted old - made-to-order my ass.  The biscuits were stale, and really resembled hockey pucks.  The mashed potatoes in the middle were not necessary and were not appetizing.  I ordered a side of sausage, and it was two tiny pieces of skimpy meat, obviously the ridiculous portion size is for the low-cost, crappy carbs only.  I didn't even care if anyone else liked their meal, it was a less-than-stellar experience and I won't return."
847,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Andrew our server was definitely amazing! He was so attentive very nice and outgoing. Great table side manner also kept our drinks full... specially working in The service industry and on vacation we totally appreciate it, food was great super satisfying and the drinks were superb! Spoke to the manager he was very nice as well totally coming back when in vegas! Ask for andrew!!!"
848,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions here are ENORMOUS. The best thing to do is share a plate. We had gotten a BLT Bloody Mary, and it does come with bacon and lettuce in it. It's cute. We had also gotten an omelet, and it was huge. Split between two people, we still didn't finish it. The hash was good and crispy, the fruit was fresh, and the omelet itself was good."
849,Hash House A Go Go,5,OMG!!!!!!!!!!!! best breakfast potatoes ever. the waffles also amazing. the plates are hug so if you are going there with more people then try to share on plate. You wont finish a plate on your own. it was delicious.
850,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Comepletly disappointed. There was over an hour wait...but it's Vegas on Sunday at breakfast time so I get it. I ordered the Famous Crab cake Benedict. Menu said all blue crab meat. What a lie!!  There's was so much stuffing in it you could barely taste the crab meat.  Portions are huge. 2 people could eat this and be full. 

Only giving a 3 because I had the most delicious lemon drop...."
851,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I don't get it! It didn't live up to the hype. I ordered a breakfast pan and it was below average. I was so disappointed. My husband however ordered a Caesar salad with chicken that was pretty good but they didn't cut they chicken and just gave him a huge breast. The wait time was very long. My husband ordered this watermelon drink that was so horrible he couldn't drink it. We won't be suggesting this place to anyone for breakfast. Maybe I will give it another shot for lunch, not anytime soon though."
852,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I came with a party of 10 and it took a little over an hour to get seated. It didn't feel that long because you can kill time walking around the strip. From the pictures the food looked amazing but when it actually came out we were not impressed. I ordered the sage fried chicken which came with a biscuit, bacon, two eggs, and mashed potatoes. Everything on the plate was piled on top of each other so the syrup on the chicken got on everything and made the bread on the fried chicken soggy. It also mixed in the mashed potatoes and eggs. I didn't think the fried chicken was as amazing as people said it was supposed to be. I also ordered a mimosa which was pretty good but not worth $8. The biscuit was super dry and we asked for butter but the waiter forgot and never brought it. One of my friends ordered a corn beef hash and it was overloaded with cheese. She ended up only eating a couple bites which was such a waste since, like everyone points out, the portions are huge."
853,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I wish that I could give this restaurant 5 stars. I really really do. Their food is amazing, their drinks are mind-blowing, their presentation is over the top and awesome! We had one of their hashes and one of their benedicts. Amazing. Watermelon lemonade? Awesome. S'more cappuccino? Thrilled the entire table! Everyone had to have a sip.


Downside... service. Completely overwhelmed. I got a huge biscuit with the hash but no butter or jam. I waited so long for my waitress to come back and check on us my biscuit was stone cold, hard as a rock, and all of us were almost done eating. That says a lot if you understand how HUGE the portions are at this place. I even flagged down another guy and he told me he would get my waitress. She showed up about 10 minutes later and had no clue that I needed anything. Clearly the guy never told her.

 I wanted to order more food, more drinks. They would have made more money! But their sad customer service made us leave, we didn't want to wait there all day for our orders. This is Vegas baby! I have stuff to do today!"
854,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place shouldn't have so many top reviews. Check the reviews ""not recommended"" by Yelp and you'll see the true story. Took us almost 10 min to be seated when the restaurant was maybe 1/3 full- on a Saturday night! We then sat at the table an upwards of 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. It wasn't like the place was that busy. The food was super greasy. Don't get the sweet potato fries unless you want them to taste like BBQ Lays chips- although they did bring me unseasoned fries to replace those when I complained. The price was comparable to a local Chilis or the like, so that was better than most Vegas restaurants. So for that, I give it 2 stars. Food was a 1 for me."
855,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The portions were hefty but lacked flavor. I dont know maybe it was me. I'd go back and try out some other items on the menu , but the stars and the moon would have to be aligned in order for me to venture back lol. Good luck cause the wait is long unless you eat lucky like me a get to sit at the bar. Peace"
856,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is pretty popular! To note it is inside the Linq not a part of the plaza outside. Plan for about a 30-45min wait for breakfast. There is nearby construction so you can feel some jolts in the building, I recommend a booth since they are secured to the floor and wall. While looking over the menu we saw huge plates come around! The eggs Benedict looked massive! We opted to go with the hash in honor of the name. I did the meatloaf hash and it was delicious! I was expected shredded hash but it was cut crispy potatoes with the pepper cheese and meatloaf. On the side an order of eggs, biscuit and fruit. Service was slow and our server wasn't very helpful, she also rushed us out before we could try dessert but the food triumphed that issue."
857,Hash House A Go Go,3,"In the land of the dinosaurs, or at least those of us who eat like one, Hash House would probably reign supreme. This city is overflowing with buffets designed to make your waist, well, overflow, and Hash House can easily provide that feeling with a single item. The fact that very few things on their menu even exceed the $15 mark is pretty impressive, but maybe that's why everything presented looks ostentatious but winds up just rather banal... an embodiment of Las Vegas as a whole, perhaps.

Style over substance certainly seems to be the modus operandi for Hash House, delivering mammoth sized meals you can't help but go ""wow!"" over, and yet very few people leave with empty plates, more likely because they simply got tired of eating surprisingly bland food, rather than being simply outmatched in the stomach capacity department. I watched multiple diners get up from the bar stools next to me leaving half or even three-quarters of a plate full of food behind. I guess when the prices are this low, in Vegas, you figure that the minimal investment isn't really worth the excessive calories.

That's all in retrospect though... I came to Hash House because I had heard tales of monolithic food combinations so loaded with flavor that they had attracted multiple food related television shows to their establishments, including a chicken and waffle dish stacked so high that it approached eye level. Without going on too much of a rant about how these shows often lead so many people astray, I'll just say that the size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w) is definitely impressive, but we all know it's what you do with it that counts. Somewhat ironically I had actually used their sage fried chicken and bacon loaded waffles as inspiration for a recent brunch party I hosted, and I can honestly say that I put Hash House to shame. What absolutely makes fried chicken is the skin, and if you've got limp, soggy skin, then your size doesn't much matter. This chicken could have been baked for all I know, as there was zero crispness to it. Add to that waffles that, aside from the bacon slices inside, are generally bland, and one tiny ramekin of syrup to assist, and I can see why people literally just got tired of eating this. 

I also gave their BLT Bloody Mary a try, thinking the ingredients would be well infused into the drink, considering that it was by far the most expensive on the menu, but instead I wound up with what essentially amounts to a sandwich shoved into a drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#SBNu2x4ogGJkvRJ5spQLRA), with no clear way on the best way to either eat or drink it. I wound up having to sip and nibble like a freaking rabbit on what has to be the clumsiest cocktail idea I've ever seen executed. After having the variations prepared by Brian, Nicole, and Gregg at my Bloody Mary Battle, this seemed outright amateurish. I should have stuck with my original intuition, passed on the alcohol, and gave the S'Mores latte a go... although if this was any indication it would have been the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man shoved into a teacup with a box of Graham Crackers on the side and someone who comes along and projectile vomits Hershey's chocolate syrup in my face."
858,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Honestly, some great food but I really don't need a lecture when I want a straw about saving the turtles in fact why don't we talk about saving people from spreading diseases that come from mouth contact with cups that have not been sanitized so that pissed me off I will say for sure about that straw Nazi waiter I had. Even further on I live in a Beach town that is more directly concerned with sea life prosperity, so get out of here desert people trying to act like they care about the ocean."
859,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food ecstasy a definite must you can thank me later . The chicken and waffles is the bomb.com. Huge portions. Sharing is caring. Chicken is so juicy tender. Waffles have bacon inside  so good. The BLT Bloody Mary is worthy all on her own.  Even the black coffee  is smooth.   Staff is friendly. Usually you wait unless your Diamond or Platinum Club (thx hubby).  Please please try this place at least once in your life. It's food coma worth suffering.
860,Hash House A Go Go,1,"On yelp, it gets high scores and is open 24 hours--but last night, neither was true.  It was midnight--and before venturing forth from the warm hotel into the 40 degree temps, I tried to call ahead to make reservations or at least see how long the line was. Unfortunately, after ringing, the line went to audix voicemail--so no help there. It would have been nice to talk to anyone, because when I arrived, a host informed me the wait would be 20-25 minutes. I was the only people in line and plenty of empty tables--but the hostess said that only two servers showed up today--so they were not able to serve at a normal capacity.  

with so much distress going on for the customers and servers, it seemed unfortunate that:
1. no one picked up the phone to warn me that this would be a huge delay
2. that the hostess wasn't running around helping the servers. perhaps it's a union issue. but whatever it was, the restaurant was not functioning in a good way last night.

It sounds like a tough night--maybe a once off. But really, the next time I need a fun atmosphere, well run restaurant, or late night option, the last place I'd feel like trying is the hash house.  And that's unfortunate because it makes all the other hash restaurants look bad too.  

Next time, the Peppermill is super reliable, fun, and ---RELIABLE.  they pick up their phones and they let us know what's going on. Also Dupars, denny's, ihop, any other restaurant open 24 hours in any hotel that is not hidden on the second floor in the middle of the linq, etc.  with a location like this, more has to go right for Hash House for this to be worthy."
861,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We came here for breakfast and I was impressed! We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and it was delicious. The chicken was really crispy but moist. I think the best part is the portions. They are huge! Although the prices are a little high, it's actually a great deal because the size of the portions allow you to split most of the meals. I split the plate with my husband and we were full until dinner. Our friends got the pancakes, and they were seriously bigger than the size of the plate! The only downside of the restaurant is that there is absolutely no signal. It wasn't a big deal to us, but I know some of us are addicted to our phones! I'll definitely try this place again whenever I am in Vegas or when I visit San Diego."
862,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It's been a year since I been here!!!! I miss it the food, it was so delicious me and my bf came here cause we heard the food here was so bomb!! Lol so we decided to try it and omg I don't regret it. Thank god we only got one plate for both cause the plate was huge and a lot of food we shared and I couldn't even finish my half lol the watermelon drink was so fresh and tasty.. I need to go back! Take me back lol 

Soon!"
863,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was my 6th time here in the last few years. In my opinion, one of the best damn values on the Strip. Whether its breakfast or dinner, portions are large and price extremely fair. If you sign up for their e-club they'll send you a buy1get1 dinner a couple weeks before your birthday. It was nice that the expiration date was 11 months out. Service was good as always too."
864,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This location was horrible I love hash house but don't go to this location! We came earlier in the morning around 0300am and we had a group of 5 and 3 of us got the Benedict 2 got the chicken and waffles all had multiple blonde hairs in their waffles and biscuits when we told the staff the assistant manager came out and all she told us was ""well we don't have any blonde cooks in the Kitchen right now"" and none of us are blonde did she think we brought blonde hairs and stuck them in the food? We don't know we wish the actual manager was in we waited for them over 30 minutes but ended up just paying for our food with hair all in it and uneaten. I REPEAT DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION"
865,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait is absolutely worth it. Every time I'm in Vegas, the group and I plan a meal here. Usually a late Sunday morning hangover meal. You just have to get mentally prepared to wait an hour to an hour and a half. Put your name in, go gamble, grab a drink downstairs, go around the corner outside to some of the bars and shops, etc. Kill time, then come back and be seated for a feast of all feasts. I look forward to being hungover here just so I can order and thoroughly enjoy their bacon-impaled bloody mary. It's the best I've ever had. I eat the mayonnaise packet and toast that comes with it and everything. That's mostly on me being a human garbage disposal, but for all other fellow garbage disposals, go here and enjoy mashed potatoes for breakfast. A person doesn't even know they want mashed potatoes with their breakfast, until they start eating and realize it's magic with eggs and fried chicken. Our server was sweet and adorable, very attentive and happy to wait on us. We loved him, super nice. We bought a collectible glass because why not. I just love everything here. You might too."
866,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait is crazy here so don't go if you want a quick meal or arrive hungry! Go early or else you'll wait for at least an hr! Food is made to order so that's another 15-30 mins wait. With that said, I really enjoyed the food here, the portions are huge, sharing food is highly recommended. Got the The Tractor Driver Combo with French Toast and it was delicious. I would highly recommend this place if you have the time. 

Parking: Parking lot is free but it's a maze to find the entrance."
867,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Get the sage fried chicken Benedict! One of the best breakfasts I've ever had and definitely #1 in breakfast in Vegas! Portion size is outrageous here! Expect left overs to take back to the room! Go get a coffee at the bar to help pass the time and keep calm for the long wait ahead! LONG wait, but worth the wait! Priced well."
868,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was delicious! Portions were huge! Service was alright.

BEST BREAKFAST IN VEGAS. Period. This place is the ultimate experience of farm breakfast, taken to a whole new level. Their staple dishes are the Sage Fried chicken with Bacon Waffles & Andy's Fried chicken Benedict. The portions are HUGE, no wonder they are featured on Man VS Food - it's a ridiculously amazing food experience. Share it with a friend! 

We went with Sage Fried chicken with Bacon Waffles. 2 giant pieces of deep fried chicken were juicy and crispy. Tucked underneath was a tower of 4 thick waffles with bacon in the middle. Drizzle it up with maple syrup and hot sauce.... man it's heavenly!!! Highly recommended, well worth the 20 bucks for so much food(and yummy too)!!!! English breakfast tea was a great complement for the meal. It was served with an open tea bag and side pot of hot water. Coffee was great too. 

I'll definitely be back next time to try the fried chicken Benedict, and also their giant pizza sized pancakes!! 

Favorites:
* Sage Fried chicken with Bacon Waffles ($19.99) - 2 sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks
* fresh brewed coffee ($2.99)
* English breakfast tea ($2.99)"
870,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best place to eat great priced, delicious food in Las Vegas!  Sage friend chicken and Waffles....Yum!  Wonderful Burger with creamed potatoes on the burger, Yes!  The portions are huge!  They immediately suggest that you share food.  Wish we had found it earlier."
871,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food here is wonderful. Dishes are far too big for the average human. I had Andy's Favorite, from Man vs Food. Chicken Benedict. There are so many scrumptious layers to this dish it is hard to compare any breakfast dish ANYWHERE. Biscuits (dense & creamy) on top of mashed potatoes, topped with bacon & eggs, then delicious juicy fried chicken, spinach, tomatoes, and my favorite, a crispy cheese pancake of yummy goodness, and finally, a chipotle cream sauce. Feel free to share. I wasn't hungry again until the next day!
The wait is long and worth it. Pricey drinks make the wait easier. 
The waitstaff, well, specifically GARY- made the experience above expectations. 
Eat here no matter what!"
872,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had the sage chicken n' waffles here. If I wasn't sure before that I am certainly sure after that suicide is never an option. This place alone is worth living. 

Look, if you've never been to a HHAGG before, drop everything and go. Right now. You haven't lived before. 

Also a BLT Bloody Mary?! Why haven't I had this in my life before?"
873,Hash House A Go Go,5,Top 3 favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. Food is creative and portions are filling. My favorite are the eggs Benedict and banana brown sugar pancakes. Be weary the portions are huge and will probably need to order less than usual!
874,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Definitely a good place for that breakfast game. We had the eggs Benedict hash that was perfect for 2.  The bloody Mary's were definitely on point ""Extra Spicy"" is the way to go. Mike Huc provided great service and was on top of everything."
875,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow had a great experience. Great food, service was awesome and not to mention the servings. Wow they are big and good for the money."
876,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing! Even better than I remembered, and we come here every time we go to Vegas. It's a must for breakfast. The plates are massive so you can share. Blood Mary's are delish.  We ordered the sage chicken. It was so good. Don't expect this to be a light meal. The menu consists of fried heavy goodness."
877,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Bacon in the waffles! Best fried chicken you will EVER have. Tangerine mimosa, I believe I will have another!"
878,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions here are huge! And the food is extremely delicious. I'd go as far to say that their chicken and waffles is better than Roscoe's! Blasphemy, I know.

 The staff is friendly enough especially when you consider this is Vegas and there's a huge crowd waiting to be seated during the brunch hours (during which I went with my girlfriend).

The only annoying thing was, and I'm sure it was a one time thing, that the section we were seated at was constantly being attacked by these damn gnats. Hopefully that doesn't happen again."
879,Hash House A Go Go,3,Food isn't great but there is plenty of it.  Everything sort of tastes like rosemary.
880,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here the last two times I was in Vegas, and loved the food. 

2011: Saturday at 2 pm, crazy lines, terrible service and we almost left. We stuck it out and loved the food and conveniently let the rest of the experience go...

2012: Friday breakfast, 10 am reservation. We were 45 minutes late but they were perfectly fine with it (we called to let them know) and were seated right away even if there was a long line of people waiting. Server was spectacular, even offered us to-go cups for our drinks if we wanted them. 

Food is always a winner:
- Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict (Man vs. Food Fave) - amazing and huge. the mashed potatoes are unbelievable, especially aside the chipotle cream. Chicken was moist and tender. (recommend to share this with someone)
- Snickers Flapjack - table favorite
- Corned Beef Hash Scramble - winner as well

Gluttonous experience if you want it to be, otherwise share the entrees. And doesnt hurt that the Roulette tables at Imperial Palace are only $5. Cheapest we've found in Vegas!"
881,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing food and amazing service. Nate was our server and I'm so impressed with his customer service. He was attentive and quick. I would definitely recommend this place
882,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I always hit this spot in Vegas! They're portions are insanely generous, and the food is always so good! Be prepared for a wait, it's a 24 hour spot and every time I go, no matter the hour, there's a wait or at least an hour. Try the Bloody Mary omg! I would give it a full five stars but the service there isn't the greatest, sometimes the servers are unfriendly or forgetful, could be because of the amount of patrons in the restaurant."
883,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Eating here is like eating the equivalent of a buffet's worth of food on one plate.

Unless you've been saving your stomach all day for this, you should share with a friend. Two of my friends came here a little past noon on a Saturday, and it was obviously packed. The wait was about 45 minutes, which is fine when you can walk around and gamble. 

My friend and I shared the salmon scramble, which has tomatoes, pesto, and brie. It was very good, but neither of us could taste the brie at all. The crispy potatoes were amazing, and the biscuit was warm and fluffy. You have to ask for butter/honey, which is kinda weird. Biscuits without butter is just wrong. My other friend had the chorizo hash, which she really liked. No matter how much she tried to eat, it didn't seem like she made a dent in her food. Unfortunately, our hotel fridge didn't have room for her leftovers so it was kind of a waste. 

If you can, try to come later. By the time we left around 3 PM, there was no wait."
884,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must-visit for foodies in Las Vegas, Hash House A Go Go promises ""twisted farm food"". What they deliver is a unique atmosphere that mashes together Bob Evans country decor with industrial Chipotle chic.

The food is fantastic. My wife had the obligatory Chicken and Waffles. The portion would feed a family of four. The waffles were crispy and flavorful, featuring bacon in the middle. They were accompanied by maple infused fried chicken that was perfectly fried. 4 waffles and 2 large pieces of chicken were stacked in a daunting tower, like a warning beacon to unwary diners at nearby tables.

I had the roasted chicken scramble, which was a more ""single human"" sized portion, but still ample. Eggs were scrambled nicely and flavored with shredded roasted chicken. The real feature here, though, was the griddled mashed potatoes. Delicious and creamy with Parmesan and garlic flavoring. A perfect complement to the smoky chicken flavor in the scramble. 

You will typically encounter a bit of a wait here, but it's worth it. Be sure to come VERY hungry or plan to share."
885,Hash House A Go Go,4,"24/7 of your southern comfort foods. This is definitely a go-to place when you're sick of all the buffets, hung-over, and hunnngry. There are plenty or reviews so here's the low-down. There are multiple Hash House A Go Go locations, DON'T BE FOOLED, only come to this one. This place is the Vegas Strip OG one, the rest don't quite taste the same. Yes the wait is long, no matter what time of day you go, but don't worry they will text you when your table is ready, so you're free to go downstairs or walk around the LINQ. 

Pancakes 5/5:
These pancakes a bomb! I got the banana original pancakes, they were amazing. Like everything else the size is huge, the pancake is probably larger than your face, very shareable. 

Egg Benedict Chicken: 5/5
Man Versus Food favorite! It's hugeeee. It's got a base of homemade mashed potatoes, on top of that is warm biscuits, on top of that is a freshly fried chicken, on top of that is an egg Benedict, and topped off with cheese and smothered in GRAVY. This mountain of awesome if the perfect meal. Did I mention it also has bacon?

Fried Green Tomatoes: 5/5
Good appetizer to share with your friends. Remember the food portions are huge."
886,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Highly recommended! This was my first time at Hash House. Went for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed my visit.

There were many folks waiting out front and we were told to wait 45 min, but we were called within 10 min. Go fig.

They would not seat us until our entire party was there. The hostesses were very lovely and helpful. Our server was very polite and quick to provide service.
The menu was very diverse. I decided upon the sweetened mango iced tea and the chicken and waffles, yum. The iced tea was not OVER THE TOP sweet as other places tend to make it. It was just right.

The chicken's fry batter had rosemary and other delicious seasonings, not common among fried chicken. It was good. The chicken pieces themselves were two large plump thighs, perfectly cooked and juicy. These two thighs were served upon four bacon waffles. It looked like they slipped several slices of bacon in the waffle iron while the batter was being poured, mmm. Finally, a large steak knife and and a large sprig of rosemary were stabbed down into the two thighs and layer of waffles to hold the tasty tower in place. The entire dish was drizzled with flash fried green onions (yum!), small diced veggies, and a ginger Teriyaki sauce. Weird call on the Teriyaki sauce, but it was good to dip the chicken in every now and then.

The best part of the meal was the price. About $35 for 3 people and HUGE portions. Definitely worth the price and worth another visit."
887,Hash House A Go Go,4,Strongly suggest sharing dishes! Really large portions. Chicken hash and banana pecan French toast were my favorites.  They take FOREVER so make sure your munchies are under control. Service was ok.
888,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food, but the portions are large - almost obnoxiously so. That's the only reason I removed a star. The food is excellent. I got the machaca scramble, my husband got the red velvet pancake."
889,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent breakfast spot on the strip at the linq.  Portions are enormous.  Two people can easily split a meal    Everything was delicious.
890,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My first time here. This is for the one at The Quad hotel next to Harrah's on the Strip. Ummm...I liked it. A lot. My wife, daughter and I had brunch here on Saturday afternoon. The food here is what they call ""twisted farm food"". It really is a good description of what they serve. It's high quality food that is creatively and well prepared. 
      The restaurant itself is busy and bustling 24 hours a day. Decorated in a farmhouse motif, the staff is constantly moving in and out of the kitchen delivering plates of very large portions of food. 
       Our server, Erik was friendly and accommodating. We perused the large and varied brunch menu while he brought our drinks. The menu has some really good sounding dishes. The signature dish here is the sage fried chicken tower. It consists of 2 large fried chicken breasts sitting on top of 3 homemade waffles. I saw a lot of people having it and it looks...really good. Maybe next time on that one. 
        We each chose one of the ""scrambles"". I had the smoked salmon scramble with mashed potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit. The scramble itself was good but not out of this world. Nothing I couldn't make in my own kitchen. The mashed potatoes were excellent. Probably the best Iv'e had. The biscuit is huge and has a hint of rosemary and also a large spring of rosemary sticking out of the top. It was excellent as well. My wife and daughter had basically the same thing except they had different ingredients in their scrambles and my wife had crispy potatoes instead of mashed. We all liked our dishes very much. 
        On this Saturday afternoon, this place looked like the place to go to cure a hangover. More than a few people looked like they were in pretty bad shape.
       This location is the only one that is open 24/7/365.  I can definitely see putting Hash House A Go Go on our regular rotation. I can't wait to return to try the sage fried chicken or one of the Benedicts.
        If you don't believe me, check out my kid's reveiw below.."
891,Hash House A Go Go,4,"There is always a wait for breakfast,  so get there early. The serving portions are huge and couple possibly be shared. I keep coming back for the Snickers pancake."
892,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food, large portions, will def go to the Chicago Location soon! can't wait to try the chicken and waffles and the stuffed cheese burgers they looked delish at other tables. Service was great and very personable too!"
893,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Prepare to wait an hour for your food to be delivered.
And then it arrived wrong.

Grilled cheese without bacon (it automatically comes on), and side salad with red onion.
Yeah, I know how difficult this is.

And it arrived cold.
I tried to deal with it because it was sort of a biz lunch. 
I removed the bacon, but the thing barely has any ""cheese"" and I use quotation marks because in all my 40 years, I've never experience cheddar cheese of this texture.

I swear it was squeeze cheese.
It was like a  spread.

No server to be found to take my food back.
Had to go to host stand twice and get assertive to get help.

Manager finally comes over and after I recite my very easy order to him and ask for a replacement, he asks if I want the tomatoes. Seriously I can't take it. Cheese sandwich with no bacon.  Never mentioned the tomatoes. 

Then when it arrives I ask him for a fork.
Do you want a knife?
I'd like a fork.
He brings a knife and fork.

The food here is gigantic and creative in its presentation but falls sort of flavor and quality."
894,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were at Hash house on memorial day weekend and the place is crowded as hell, even then it took us just half hour to get in... The food is ridiculously tasty, heavy and greasy..almost took an afternoon to come out of the food coma. Not a big fan of their mimosas which come in a tiny cup and are expensive."
895,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Service was superb. I was with a large party and we had time constraints, we had a meeting to attend. Friendly waitress and she was very attentive...I do not remember her name. This was my first time at the restaurant. When they say the portions are HUGE they mean it. Definitely share a plate, no way to eat an order by yourself no matter how hungry you are. The hash is DELICIOUS, definitely worth a revisit next time I am in Las Vegas."
896,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a ""must do"" if on vacation or hosting someone who is. There usually is a line unless you go in the middle of the night, which you can since it's opened 24 hours. The presentation is picture worthy and just about everything we have tried is fabulous. (Biscuits are a little dry for my taste but who am I) Pancakes seem to be a popular item and at 13"", you can cut it like a pizza and share a slice. Portions are ginormous so either decide to share or plan for a lot of leftovers. 
Now, as a local... this is way too much food and just a little pricey for a weekly visit."
897,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I feel like this location is a huge flop and not what the actual restaurant represents. The products are not the same (don't get the BLT Mary at this location, it's a sad attempt at imitating the real one in SD), the vibe is not the same, money put into staffing is not the same. My poor waiter was having to run around to cover the bar, a bunch of tables, and run his food. HHAGG, if you can't deliver the same product and service 24 hours a day, don't have your restaurant open 24 hours a day. Have some respect for such a great venue and concept. There's no room for subpar at any time on the strip, Denny's is already a thing."
898,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Thought the food was good! I got a flapjack and hubby got the chicken and waffles. He felt bad about not being able to eat it all because he thought that it was so good, but portion size was crazy (couldn't finish mine either). Our waiter could've been more attentive but otherwise good experience. Would eat here again."
899,Hash House A Go Go,4,"To say the Hash House has huge portions is an understatement. Come hungry.

The pancakes can be used as a spare tire. The chicken and waffles were good, i liked how they cook the bacon inside the waffles.French toast with carmalized bananas were also very good. There fresh squeezed orange juice is the best ive ever had.

Next time i come ill practice what i preach and come hungry."
900,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food here is Big. Quality is very good. The buttermilk biscuit actually smelled of buttermilk. We saw other tables order chicken and waffles, they were food towers!. The juice was fresh and waiter very nice. We will return."
901,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I would love to give 5 stars based on food only. .. However,  we were sat, placed our order...not busy during this time. ..PLENTY of open tables. ..3 additional tables were seated after us. We ordered a chicken and waffles to split...and so did they...ALL three tables (a 3 top, a 2 top, and a 4 top) all got their food before we got ours. Not cool at all. Food was AMAZING...5 stars...watching ""our"" chicken and waffles being delivered to 3 other tables - 1star!
We wanted to try this place so bad when we 1st went it was an hour and a half wait...so we waited til the breakfast rush was over and went in. Will go back"
902,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was amazing!  As my 9 year old put it,if the wait is so long, it has to be good!  We were a party of 5 for breakfast and waited about 45 minutes for our table. Our waiter was great, he gave us lots of pointers on the menu, such as how large the portions are and suggested sharing. My son had the kids French toast platter which gave envy to your everyday adult breakfast platter. My husband and I shared the Sage Chicken Benedict and each had a Smores Cappuccino. The food is made from scratch upon order so it takes roughly 20-25 minutes for your dishes to come out but they are worth every minute. Come hungry and leave satisfied!  Great for brunch!"
903,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was amazing one plate is enough to feed two ppl .. The service was just okay took them awhile to come around..
904,Hash House A Go Go,5,I had eatin there 3 times during my memorial day break and it only got better each time no complaints at all. only wish they still had one near me in kansas
905,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Man O Man.  What else is there to say other than BAD ASS!!!   This place was great.  My girl and I went hear for breakfast and we had a pleasant food experience.  She got this giant blueberry pan cake and I got the frien chicken Benedict.  It's not just a bunch of food thrown together, but also delicious as well.  All the flavors of the Benedict were popping individually.  We will definetly be back for more !!!"
906,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh. My. God. 

Can this place really be real? The food here is absolutely INCREDIBLE! So delicious with EXTRA LARGE portions...like, share with a friend. Seriously. We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles and both dishes were to die for. Bacon strips placed inside of waffles?! How can you not be ok with that?? Bes thing ever. No complaints just super full bellies and an awkward waddle out the door. We had a 45 minute wait to be seated for a party of 5 but we just headed to O'Shea's downstairs to pass the time. Went by pretty quick and definitely worth the wait. The place is open 24 hours which is also a cool touch as it makes for great drunk and/or hungover food. Or just good food in general. Oh and don't forget to try the BLT Bloody Mary!!"
907,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ordered the rosemary chicken and waffles and it did not disappoint. The portion is large 2 pieces boneless chicken breast, 4 waffles, and three pieces bacon. I split the meal with my hubby and the server brought us a large plate so we could each have our own. I had the bacon on the side but they normally mix it in the waffle. Chicken was moist and flavorful and the waffles had a good flavor as well. Maple syrup is served in a small pitcher on the side of the plate. My only complaint would be they should serve more syrup with he meal so you do not have to request more. 
We came about two o'clock and were seated immediately. Service was very good and server gave us time to review the menu since this was my first time here. I would definitely come back."
908,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I always love coming here. The portions are so large, my wife and I order 1 dinner and split it. Always great service and creative food combos and drinks. A must if your looking for good food in Vegas!"
909,Hash House A Go Go,2,"My second trip to Hash House, first time went to the one on Sahara, had no intention of ever going back, but had to come here for work function. 
 More than ever stand firm in my rating. 
 Pretty much everyone I know that has visited this restaurant either LOVES it or, like me, doesn't get what's to love about it.
 First, credit where it's due- fast, efficient, food comes out accurately and promptly and there's a LOT of it. Our party had almost 20 and was handled seamlessly. 
 Now the food- if you want an enormous heaping platter of completely tasteless breakfast fare- look no further. You have found just the place!
 The lack of taste is uniformed pretty much regardless of what you order, I've sampled my family's food on previous visit and stole a bite off co-worker's plate. The kitchen is very conservative with flavor and seasoning- not sure if they simply expect that patrons will douse everything with hot sauce and go to town with salt shaker, but there you have it. 
 Stuck to poached eggs, as I saw no reason to load up on bland calories. 
 You are really better off either cracking eggs into a skillet in your own kitchen or hitting up one of the myriad of coffee shops in this city."
910,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Long wait for the food, but of course I do enjoy the food. Just don't come if you're starving. Staff could be a little more friendly. Our waiter checked on us 1 or 2 times over an hour including while we were waiting for the food to come out."
911,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It may have been the only place open, for breakfast, when normal adults are awake and functioning human beings. You know, 8:30 am. Not really trying to eat pizza or a burger from Johnny Rocket's. Lucky for my two friends and I, we were staying across be way so we rolled into Hash House. 

Be. Prepared. To. Wait.

But it's worth it. The food is well flavored and there are GIANT portions. Unless you're morbidly obese, you won't be able to finish the portions. Which makes for great drunk munchies later. 

I had the man v food favorite: save fried chicken Benedict. Imagine that giant plate of food in front of a five foot, petite lady - challenge accepted. As Louis C.K. says, the meal isn't over when I'm full, it's over when I hate myself and I was pretty close by eating half of the plate. It was worth it though. If you're a good southern man or woman...or you just like delicious breakfast foods go there!"
912,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We got there a little after 10:30 AM and the line was already long. We waited 30 minutes before we were seated. The waiter was very friendly. He took our drink and food and left. It didn't take very long before we got our drinks and then came our meals. The portions are huge. 2-3 people can eat off one plate, literally. My favorite is the chicken waffle which consist of 3 large thick waffles topped with 2 huge chicken breast being held by a steak knife. My friend ordered the chicken pot pie and let me tell you, this was no ordinary pie. It looked creamy with chunks of chicken and veggies. And if you're into pancakes, don't forget to order the banana pancake. It was massive. It was actually larger then the plate. lol. Make sure to was down all that food with their signature Bloody Mary.  Everyone went home with a souvenir glass which by the way was awesome, it reminded me of the leaning tower of Pisa. If you're willing to wait, this place is  definitely a place to grab something to eat and enjoy with family and friends!!!"
913,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yelp 100 Challenge * 53/100

Find Hash House A Go Go at The Quad (where the Imperial Palace would have been) Heavy construction work is underway so don't be surprised if you find yourself navigating a labyrinth of a path to get here. (Apparently, renovation/alteration is not done yet!) 

Family Tuesday cannot happen this week with schoolwork (and everything in between) piling up for me so I convinced my parents to follow our adventurous compass and head here today. When we got to the first floor, I scanned the celebrity guests whose signatures lined menus in the waiting room outside the restaurant and saw a picture of Adam Richman from Man vs. Food taking a shot at the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle Tower! Sold. We agreed to share what sounded like a mutated chicken and waffle combo. And we were right. It was ginormous! That and an extra order of Basic on the side which included 2 sunny side ups, ham, 2 wheat bread with butter and diced potatoes and I was charged with all the necessary carbs that lasted me for the whole day. My parents were too stuffed to elaborate about their meal by the time we were done, but I'm assuming they had a blast. American portions still get pretty overwhelming for us (and to think that we were already sharing our orders)

Papa couldn't help commenting that the fried chicken was just the right level of crispy and mommy loved how the waffles had bacon stuffed in it. I would hop here for breakfast more often if only the construction below wasn't as disruptive as it was. Over the course of our meal, we heard someone drilling beneath the floor of the party next to us. We could literally feel the ground shake and servers were shaking their heads in frustration. Thankfully everyone was taking it with a grain of salt and light-hearted humor (Someone joked that they thought it was their baby making all the noise) 5 stars without the noise. Perhaps another stop in the future will up my update review."
914,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Sage fried chicken and BACON waffles!  BF had the corned beef hash.  The portions here are HUGE.  I didn't even get through half of mine.

This rating isn't for the food -- would've given it more stars if the service hadn't been ridiculously slow.  It took a good 5+ minutes after we were seated before out server even acknowledged us, 10-15 minutes for drinks to arrive, and another 30+ minutes before the food actually got to the table.  It wasn't even very crowded when we went (after 1pm on a Saturday)."
915,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Absolutely loved my meal. It was huge though. I couldn't finish it, even when sharing. Service was a little hit and miss but the food was definitely good. I tried the Andy's sage fried chicken benedicts, delicious and huge portion. Make sure to share."
916,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It was our last meal of our LV vacation, and we decided we'd do brunch here. I saw the Man v. Food episode and was determined to try the Sage Chicken Benedict!

It was a little confusing finding the restaurant.  The Quad is on the strip, but the parking was a little sketchy and once in the casino we had to ask someone where the restaurant was. We were told the wait was 25 minutes, but was seated in less than 10. 

My husband and I shared the Sage Chicken Benedict and the French Toast...MMMMMMM!!! It was a great combo. It was a TON of food, but we justified it by making it brunch and knew we wouldn't have another meal until very late that night. The chicken is tender, the potatoes were delish (my husband loved them), and the chipotle sauce was the perfect topper. The french toast was the best I ever had - perfectly done with pecans and grilled bananas...great combination. I didn't even need maple syrup. 

Our waiter, Scotty, was very friendly and helpful, as was the other waiters I observed. I recommend Hash House a Go Go and suggest sharing a couple dishes. If you have a busy day planned, this is a great place to fuel up. And the coffee is great, too...not that see-thru, flavorless, tea-like stuff!"
917,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We ate here very late one night after some Vegas nightlife and several libations. We split the chicken and waffles. I thought it was delicious, but want to give it another try at a different time. We attempted to eat brunch here the day we left and there was a 30 minute wait. I'll definitely go next trip to Vegas."
918,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Be ready to wait if you're going to eat here. It's a decent size restaurant in Vegas but very popular especially since this one is on the strip. I suggest sending someone early to get a table and meet you later. The food is worth waiting for though if you love breakfast. The plates are huge! Decent price for the amount you get. If you don't eat that much I'd suggest sharing. The only downside is it's called hash house but they don't have the typical hash browns, they're dices potatoes. A bit disappointing on that note but one place if return when I go back to Vegas."
919,Hash House A Go Go,2,Huge portions but really not a good quality and rather pricey wouldn't stop again far better places to eat in LV
920,Hash House A Go Go,2,"It's your typical Vegas eatery: loud, long wait, over-priced. But, the service was exceptional--the only redeeming quality. The food portions are huge and are easily shared with someone. You will not walk away hungry from this joint.  We had a salmon hash and asked for pancakes as well. The hash was bland and the pancakes were dry. Others in our party had the Sage Chicken and Waffles, which come highly recommended. They can accommodate large groups, but head downstairs for drinks and games while you wait.

TLDR: Avoid the pancakes, get the chicken and waffles."
921,Hash House A Go Go,4,"May 28, 2011 Saturday - dinner 6:15 PM
2 adults & kid

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 3 stars

Background - Picked this based on the reviews I read about the one in Reno.  I assumed it was in Harrah's in Vegas too.  But I was wrong.  I got redirected after asking security at Harrah's.  Then I walked past the escalator without realizing the restaurant was on the second floor in a special section.  None of their ""floor - traffic"" boards even mention Hash House.

Atmosphere - Trendy place but the tables are too tall or the chairs are too short.  Too trendy for my taste, I just found it difficult for me at 5' 11"", my daughter had at least a pillow to help her out.  

Food
Appetizer - We had the dinner menu but did not see anything listed that looked like an app.

Main Course - We ordered the Duck to split between the two of us.  The waiter warned us the sizes were very large.  He was not kidding.  The duck was very good.  But the mashed yams/potatoes stole the meal.  Oh my they were so good.  I can not even describe it.  I do not know if it was the wrapped meat around it or just the mixing of yams with it, but it made the meal!  They also finished the plate with whole carrots and green beans on the sides.

Dessert - This thing was large enough for one person as a meal.  We ordered the bread pudding made with snickers.  It took 20 minutes after we placed the order so you know they just made it for us, awesome!  The amount of vanilla ice cream on top of the black gooey mess was more than I would put in a bowl for myself.  $8 for this gooey heaven was well worth the wait.  If they have this in Reno I could see going their just for that alone.  It is worth every calorie.  By the way the three of us probably only ate a third of it after the huge dinner.

Service - I have to say I was very disappointed here.  Best way to put the host station was seriously lacking.  Sure a large party was in front of us.  But after the one and only hosted figured out how many people there was he disappeared for a while with no word to us.  And what was strange was the restaurant was not overly full, maybe 50% occupancy.   Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  He promptly told us about the $2.50 split plate charge for our dinner.  But before dinner was served he brought me my extra plate.  The plate was not clean, but you could tell it went thru the dishwasher.  His response to the dirty plate is ""I just grab and go"" which makes sense since the pile plates should be perfect for service.  With dessert the food was delivered by a food runner.  He realized we did not have silverware and he went to grab some.  I could see him searching and picking out clean ones from the tray of spoons.  So that make question how clean the ones we did not get.  I think they have a dishwasher issue."
922,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Bomb dot com! I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the rude hostess who was giving us attitude in the beginning. But apart from that, the food and service was amazing. I am obsessed with their kiwi watermelon lemonade!! I also ordered their roasted chicken hash ...the first thing on the top of their menu. Delicious! I don't think anything here will be disappointing. The wait is hella long but I guess you can go gamble while you wait (:"
923,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was referred to this place by a few friends of mine, and I didnt know that it was going to be totally awesome!!  This location was inside the Imperial Palace, which as many times as I have been to Vegas, never stepped a foot in... but boy was I missing out on great food. 

The dining area is very comfortable, the service was great - our server Jay was very nice and informative on how the whole theme and menu works. His recommendation was a house favorite which was a fried chicken biscuit Benedict and it was totally worth the wait! Great flavor, presentation and portion size! Luckily, my husband and I shared the dish - because it is hefty there. Tasty accompaniments to drink with your meal:  their Bloody Mary or Champagne Supernova. Delicious!!

All in all, a ROCKIN' place for two or more, food is awesome , worth the $$ and  a super sure bet in a Vegas Casino :) definitely recommend Imperial Palace location."
924,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I yelped to find this gem. It's located in the LINQ hotel and casino which is currently being renovated so a lot of construction workers walking around and lots of painting walls going on. It shouldn't really cause a problem if you're just walking through like I was. 

Now to the restaurant, I hope you are hungry! They don't play when it comes to food here. I got the biscuits and gravy which was served over mashed potatoes. Wow. It was huge. I could have probably done without the potatoes just because it's starch on starch on starch, but it was tasty nonetheless. My friend got the bacon waffles with chicken. I can't remember exactly what is was called but it was insane. A tower of deliciousness. I ended up eating off that plate too :). I would imagine this is what they are known for, so don't go without giving it a try!"
925,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Presentation is key, and also the key element when I rated this restaurant.

My friends and I went nearing Memorial Day weekend. I, of course, suggested this place only because I'm a Man vs. Food fan and had to try the ever so popular Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict. The dish was absolutely massive and the presentation was perfect. The combination of the flavors (tomatoes, cheese, bacon, and egg) was definitely something to ""Yelp"" about all on its own - - down to the mash potatoes and the huge, fresh biscuit.  However, I found the chicken itself to be good, but not great [hence a rating of only 4 stars]. As a fried chicken connoisseur there was absolutely no flavor in the chicken. It definitely had to be combined with the chipotle sauce to be fully enjoyed, but it was not dry. I did eventually add Tabasco sauce which heightened the entire dish ten-fold. Furthermore, although it was not a Man vs. Food challenge, you can't eat the entire dish. It's just impossible. If you're able to finish the dish and live to tell about it, I'd be convinced that (1) an additional stomach was surgically added to your digestive system or (2) you're a cow.

The waiter was extremely nice and very accommodating I must add. I would definitely suggest this place to any Vegas visitors/residents that want good food, good portions, and at a seemingly good price. Enjoy yourselves and don't forget the Tabasco! ;-)"
926,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We did not have to wait to get a table, but they were busy. Mario was our server and he was very attentive. He helped with recommendations. Our food was brought out in a timely manor. Everything was delish but always know you can share since it is ALOT of food. Always a great time and great food"
927,Hash House A Go Go,4,Got the espresso double shot to start my meal and then moved on to my pork tenderloin Benedict - portion is huge so definitely prepare yourself before coming here!
928,Hash House A Go Go,5,"the portions are enormous! i had the tractor driver combo with french toast and was so full i didn't need to eat the rest of the day. my husband had the corned beef hash and he loved it, and it left him stuffed to the brim as well! the bloody marys are perfect - just the right amount of spice! i've been to vegas twice but this was the first time we ventured into the quad/linq area and it is not to be missed!"
929,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ever been really amped up to try something that everyone has raved about only to be disappointed? Well, that's what I thought was going to happen here. I am very happy to say my expectations were not only met, but exceeded. 

First off, this place is suuuuper popular so if you don't get here early (or late) expect to wait a very very long time for a table. Unless you're a high ranking Total Rewards member & can bypass the wait time. I'd become a member just for this perk alone!

Food here is all amazing and in huge portions. Everything on the menu is easily shareable between two or more people. Keep that in mind. Don't let your stomach tell your brain it can finish anything you order. Chances are...you can't.

Now, the reason why I came here is because everyone raves about the chicken & waffles. I love me some Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles so I had to try these. I knew I was going to get a more gourmet meal than Roscoe's, but that's fine. Let me tell you...my food life has changed. The chicken was amazing. Juicy center, crispy outside..and with some amazing seasonings. This was easily the best fried chicken I've ever had. The menu said the waffles were bacon waffles so I was expecting waffles with little flecks of bacon. What I got was a waffle with several entire strips of back down the middle. It was heavenly! Only issue is that this is all stacked so high & on a somewhat small plate so once you break it down to eat, plate space becomes in high demand. I couldn't avoid spilling things onto the table (sorry cleaners!) But oh man was this one of the best dishes I've ever had for brunch. And no...I couldn't finish it. And I did everything I could to do so.

So yes, my experience at Hash House was excellent. And I will be back as often as I can."
930,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great place to eat. We have eaten here at least 5 times. The service is wonderful. The food is great. The price is good for what you get. A lot of food. The pretty coffee drinks are ok but not great.
931,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I highly recommend going here for breakfast! My husband and I stayed at Caesars and didn't like there options for breakfast. We searched yelp and it came up for a hot breakfast spot. It is about a ten minute walk from Caesars  and worth it! We had the French toast, eggs, bacon, home fries and biscuits! Yum yum yum!"
932,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Awesome place if you love breakfast anytime of the day! I tried a blueberry pancake. Have you heard the portions are huge????? OMG! One pancake resembled a tire...I couldn't see my plate! We had a group of 6 and everything was delicious...you truly can't go wrong. The only thing was the hot chocolate was just warm, but probably just a fluke. I'll be back!"
933,Hash House A Go Go,5,Omg . I mean everything was good .. And large portions at that . Pancakes and waffles are as big as my face ... The chicken Benny .. Man vs food for real .. Please split that with a friend lol hahaha and the salmon Benedict was bomb too . Just everything OMg
934,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Holy crap.  The waitress was not kidding when she said the portions are HUGE.  I had a bit of everything - omelettes, scrambles, waffles, pancakes... they were all good but nothing special.  I saw a lot of tables order the fried chicken and waffles but no one in our group was feeling it at 7am.  For the price and portions, it's definitely worth a try.  However service was incredibly slow and the food only tasted ok - nothing I would crave again.  I wouldn't mind coming back but I certainly won't go out of my way for it."
935,Hash House A Go Go,5,So good. I recommend the andy's sage fried chicken eggs benedict (Man Vs Food favorite). Order one and it will feed 2. Delicious!
936,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Might be a good idea to bring a snack with you because the wait for a table at this place is unbelievably long. However once you get seated the service and food are amazing. The warn you upfront that the portions are generous. I was able to taste the chicken and waffles and my oh my were they good. The chicken was so incredibly moist and the waffles had full strips of bacon cooked in. Delish. I also had the French toast with bacon. The presentation was almost food porn. Two large pieces of French toast with a nice helping of butter atop and a sliced banana atop of everything. It was much better than I expected. I could eat this for breakfast daily....except that wait would only allow me to try it when I have some time on my hands....

As an aside the cell phone signal in this restaurant is atrocious especially if you have AT&T."
937,Hash House A Go Go,2,"BIG BIG PORTIONS!!!!!!!

5 stars total:
-1 star for the 45 min wait to be seated.
-1 star for the service. Our waitress only came by 2 times. 
-1 star for the LONG wait for my food (at least 1 hr) but then again the portions are huge so I wouldn't think the cook are fast enough to prepare everything.

Come here HUNGRY because every plate is huge.

I got the Meatloaf skillet. Pretty tasty but there were way too many potatoes. Maybe I'll come back here again...."
938,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went for breakfast with the family.  Busy but reasonable wait considering.   Coffee was fresh, Starbucks blend and the server made sure it was never empty.  I ordered the Chroizo JalapeÃ±o hash while the missus got the meatloaf has with sausage gravy for the biscuit.   Served hot and made to order with fresh ingredients.  Chorizo had robust flavor that complemented the cheddar and potatoes.  The missus' meat loaf have wonderful texture and subdued flavors.  Biscuits are huge and fluffy and the gravy is amazing.  Will go back for the chicken and waffles or the vanilla waffles next time.  Wonderful food, good value but not quiet!"
939,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hash House A Go Go is a go to in my book. Hash House is open 24/7 so this is perfect for brunch or 12:00 am.  I also like the huge portions and biscuits you get before you eat (don't eat more then 1 biscuit...) Even though I don't recommend this for lunch or dinner because the Linq has other many great places to eat but this is a go to for brunch or breakfast.
940,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I have to say I have always loved Hash House and the food is good but my last experience was terrible on every level.  It seems like the air conditioning is out and the Restaurant blames the Casino but it was over 84 degrees in the dining room which is uncomfortable.  I couldn't order coffee for breakfast that's a deal breaker.  

My Server was Tara S. And she was not attentive whatsoever.  We had a larger group of 7 and we really never saw our server.  We didn't get water refills, had to ask front desk for help to get more syrup, water refills, milk basically everything.  I also alerted a blonde male host that we needed more attention and he did not alert the manager.  

Bacon was cold and my pancakes got cold while a waited for our drinks.  Honestly I am very disappointed I brought a group of friends from out of town and it was embarrassing.  Great place having an off day but that's no excuse for bad service and an uncomfortable climate.  Vegas is a hot place especially on the strip and it's not fun to eat in a hot dining room.  Especially with either an overwhelmed server or someone who doesn't care.  I think Vegas is extremely competitive with great restaurants and after lots of good reviews this place is nothing like what it used to be.  Hopefully more people will write bad reviews so they will improve.  I would advise making a different choice next time I won't be revisiting this particular Hash House again anytime soon.

My check number 2876 on April 30th 10:09AM."
941,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was very good and had good prices. You definitely have to try a flapjack. The price might seem a bit much for just a flapjack, but the portion size is huge and it is probably the best pancake I've had. My husband and I shared a brown sugar and banana flapjack and a hash and we had plenty to eat and even left overs."
942,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Definitely a hidden gem at the Quad! Worth checking out if you want an upgrade dinner type of food. The safe fried chicken and waffles is delicious. All their servings is huge so if you don't want to be totally stuff, then split it with someone. The entree comes with 2 fried chicken and 4 waffles stuffed with bacon. Yum! Sharing is caring. We were served by Brad and he was amazing! He was attentive and friendly!!!"
943,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Luv love love this place...I've never been disappointed.  Vegas pricey but the portions are HUGE.  The waffles were so good I ate them cold.  
Drink specials are tasty but a little sweet."
944,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place has to be on everyone's list when going to Las Vegas. The portions are insane and the price can't be beat for what you get. Everyone at the table was amazed by the food and service. I left very full and was unable to finish my meal.
945,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The sever switched the receipt n he wrote $37 more, then he signed it!!
Although I payed 18% tips :( 
He must thought we're just tourist from Asia n not gonna argue with that.
More ridiculous thing is the manager seems like doesn't care about this.
I talked to the manager n she said they gonna refund it ASAP but after they got my card info I can't hear anything from her over 10days!!
So I had to call my card customer service explained what's going on-_-
Everyone knows fake sign is serious problem but only this restaurant doesn't know.. 
This was the worst worst experience I ever been through"
946,Hash House A Go Go,4,Large amount of food and you will be stuffed upon leaving. Staff very friendly and nice to work with when ordering and during the meal.  HEATHER S. was order server and see did and understanding job.  BBBLT is worth trying for lunch.
947,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The price was reasonable in compare to the portion size. The staffs were friendly...
Even though the place and the furniture were not really nice, the food was awesome...."
948,Hash House A Go Go,4,One plate easily feeds 2 people and a small child. The chicken and waffles here is the star of the show. Service was efficient.
949,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food is OK (I like the mashed potatoes instead of hash browns), but the place is pretentious and expensive. They need to master the basics, like cleanliness  -- had a big glop of something on my menu and a sticky fork. The pretense (big sprig of rosemary stuck in the biscuit) may justify the higher price, but a biscuit with no butter seems a little dry. Portions are huge."
950,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was amazing. I ordered the hash with vegetables. I could taste every vegetable in my dish. Our waiter was extremely polite, noise level was a little high and I don't know if there were bathrooms on the floor. Either way I recommend it for anyone who wants to stuff your face with delicious food."
951,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Haven't even gotten our food yet but horrible and straight up rude customer service. The table we were seated at was extremely uncomfortable for not only all of of us but specifically my grandma and I who have both had knee surgery. You have to crunch your legs mind you we are both 5'1 just to give you an idea of how small the table actually was. We asked our server to move to a bigger table and he allowed us to do so and it was way more comfortable for us. We all settled in the new table when a rude hostess came out of no where with the biggest attitude and told us we could not sit there and it is not our table and we need to get up and move. We then asked for a manager and he went to get one and in that time another hostess proceeded to come who was extremely loud and obnoxious and made a huge fuss about us sitting at the table we told we were allowed to sit at. A manager then came and we are now sitting at our third table. I understand that they needed the table for a bigger party but they should've told us and done so in a professional and polite manner, I will never return to this restaurant in this location again."
952,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food here was absolutely spectacular. I ordered the French toast and it was so soft and perfectly tasty. The best I've ever had. I also tried my friends hash browns. They were perfect. The food there is easily 5 stars. The service however is not so great. Our waiter, in particular, was quite serious and terse. We asked him to split the check and he turned into a drama queen and made it seem like it was the end of the world. I'm pretty sure he rolled his eyes too. But hopefully your service experience will be different. The food is most definitely worth giving it a go!"
953,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Absolutely delicious food, huge portions, highly recommend the Spiked Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade."
954,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Nice place
Take a very long time to be seated because its so busy there, but its worth the wait in vegas price is decent plus so much food you can take back to your room for the next day...
But i will definitely go there every time im in vegas"
955,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best breakfast in Nevada, worth the 18min drive from Vegas. Our new go to breakfast, took some time to cook but worth the wait, good things come when you take the time to make them"
956,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is a must in Vegas. Huge portions decent prices and great taste. The chicken & waffles could easily feed 3 people.
957,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is very creative in the way they plate the meals, and extremely generous with food options. Some of the garnishes are unnecessary but over all it was a great dining experience. The customer service was excellent as well."
958,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Be prepared to WAIT! The service was as good as could be expected (considering how busy it was) and the food was pretty good. The fourth star is mostly because I was so excited when my food finally showed up (after 60 minutes waiting for a table and 45 minutes waiting for my food) that it tastes amazing! 
Actually, I do think the good was objectively tasty. They have tons of pancake options and the pancake is massive (and moist and flavorful). The fresh squeezed juice was yummy and held me over until the food arrived. 
The major downside is really just that it takes SO looooooong to get served. Do not go hungry! Perhaps it would be best to put your name on the waiting list here immediately after finishing a meal elsewhere- you'll be hungry by the time you get fed. :)"
959,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was great. We caught a cab off the strip to check it out, had heard great things. It certainly lived up to the hype.  The food was awesome, sort of old school country fare on steroids. Huge portions. I don't think it really clicks, even reading all these reviews, how massive these portions are until you start digging in!"
960,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were checking out the new O'Shea's Casino next to The Quad casino and decided to grab a little grub. We took the escalator up and came up to an empty hostess stand, but she came back pretty quickly and seated us right away. The waitress came over shortly thereafter and we were off and running. I ordered the corned beef hash with two eggs over easy. The potato cubes arrived super crispy, which I love. The hash was fresh and tasty and had some swiss cheese running throughout.  It also came with a nice slice of watermelon.  The corned beef is more of a shredded style of hash. I'm a fan and I'll definitely be back for more."
961,Hash House A Go Go,5,Just left here with friends and it was amazing! Food delicious and service outstanding. Brian was our waiter and he did an excellent job! He was super friendly and very efficient. This place is a must have!
962,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was expecting much better based on the 4-star average Yelp rating.

My breakfast hash dish was too salty, eggs were undercooked, and asparagus was underripe and stringy.

After food was delivered, it took me a while to get someone's attention."
963,Hash House A Go Go,4,"must go if your in vegas!!! if you can wait for like 20-30 min. you have to come for breakfast. its always a line but it moves fast! i love how they plate their food, very elegant! and will have you full!
a must go!"
964,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Although Hash House A Go Go was highlyÂ recommended by severalÂ Vegas locals, I honestly believe it is overrated. The large portioned farm style mealsÂ lookÂ amazing in photographs, but lack the same wow factor in taste. For starters, the waffle batter had a veryÂ cheap generic tasteÂ and got extremely hard. The flapjacks batter was definitely better, butÂ I did not enjoy the apple skins in my cinnamon apple pancakes. The serving sizes are alsoÂ disproportionate becauseÂ the very large pancakeÂ only comes with one egg and two strips of bacon. Also I would notÂ recommend the fried potatoes at all, they were hard andÂ greasy. Overall unenjoyable."
965,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Heard lots of buzz about the place and I see why...the portions were huge, but that's good by me. I'm also very understanding so it takes quite the mess up to make me give terribly low ratings. Things like the establishment being too loud or having ""outdated decor"" won't ruin my meal. After all, it's Vegas. If you want a quiet breakfast, go to Reno. Food was great, service was good. No complaints here at all, will be back"
966,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This whole ordeal was pretty much heaven in a hand basket. Our wait time was estimated at 40 minutes, but was only about 12 minutes. While we waited, we ordered drinks from the bar in the waiting area. Be warned- those drinks are all about $2 more than the actual menu prices for them when you are seated.  

We had 4 dishes between the 5 of us, and that was WAY too much food. The biscuits and gravy were tasty and included a mashed potato situation that just worked wonders with this meal. The corned beef hash plate was not really a hash, but that corned beef was so good! 

The other two meals we had were some of the more renowned ones. The chicken and waffles were AMAZING. In fact, the waffles are stuffed with bacon. Yes, stuffed. With. Bacon. That pretty much automatically made them the best waffles I've ever had. Also, the sage chicken Benedict was a massive heap of glory and all that is holy. 

In the end, we were very pleased. And our waitress was incredibly efficient and attentive.  So yeah, if I come back to Vegas, I will DEFINITELY be back here."
967,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came back for the 2nd night in a row, we got the same server Delaini & she was awesome! Great service. Had the chicken benedict. Again, chicken was moist & the Chipotle sauce was awesome! Ask for her, she'll give you great service! And order this dish!"
968,Hash House A Go Go,2,Just another overrated hyped up place. Had blueberry pancake and eggs. Pancake was bland but big. Better places to eat and less expensive.
969,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food, huge portions. As most of the reviews state, the chicken and waffles are the way to go. The chicken is delicious and the waffles are stuffed with bacon. Service was fast and our waitress was extremely nice."
970,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm a fan of Hash House A Go Go, however I'm not a fan of this specific location.  It takes over an hour to be seated.  This is because it's the only location on the strip.  It's inside of the Linq hotel.  If you have the time, the other location off Fremont St. is not as chaotic.  In my opinion worth it.

Everything ordered was a hit.  Even down to the burnt green tea that I had.  Best breakfast house in the heart of touristy Vegas."
971,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place to go if you have a large appetite. The food portions are out of this world, two people can be full off of 1 meal. The wait was about 20 minutes as this place is pretty popular. The staff was great, but the wait was long."
972,Hash House A Go Go,4,Very good and one of the few food bargains in overpriced LV. Especially if you share entrees as we heartily suggest. Try the Chicken & Waffles!
973,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Waiter welcomed us to the restaurant and kept reiterating how big portions are there. Even going so far as to comparing items on our table to the size of their food items. Expectations were set high. 

He pointed to a section of the menu for sharing and said ""I'd like to call these visually appealing in proportions."" Starting to think he's going a little over the top with telling us how big portions are, the food here must be massive. 

Needed a beer so asked what lagers they had, but our Waiter didn't know what a lager even was. Decided to take him up on his recommendation and go with the tiger shrimp for sharing with my GF. 

The shrimp arrived. It was literally 3 little pieces of shrimp and a small piece of watermelon. There was a lot of decorative items to distract how little there was...it was a joke! We were actually laughing how chintzy it was. 

You can tell our waiter was very embarrassed, he didn't come by once to ask how it was, ask us for another order, just ran away. 

It came to $19.78 for a beer and 3 shrimps. What a rip off! Falsely advertised and poor service from our server. 

Best off eating somewhere outside instead, especially if it's for breakfast since you will wait for about an hour to be seated and no reservations."
974,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG!  Huge portions, great wait staff and decent prices. Go hungry or plan to eat left overs for a few days. Delicious!!"
975,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We visit this restaurant every year! It is absolutely perfect. The food is great, and the portion size its OUTSTANDING. Totally recommend it. Our server Michael was wonderful!"
976,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awsome food. Our waitress Kristie was amazing. Quick service and great food. I would recommend  it if you come Vegas.
977,Hash House A Go Go,5,I love when I come to Vegas I have to come to Hash House. There food is the best I'm so glad my friend told me about this place.
978,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really great spot for some HUGE portions of comfort food. We came just before 1p.m. and it was pretty packed (45 to 60min wait for 2). Luckily we found two spots at the bar. The bar tenders were really nice but you could tell they were pretty overloaded with tasks which made service a little slow, hence 4 stars instead of five. We ordered the chicken and waffles...MMMMMMM!!! It was enormous...served on a serving platter haha. We shared this and still have a full half left for breakfast tomorrow before we fly home. Definitely good hangover food too :) check it out."
979,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome food! Great service...I have been to most in Vegas...the best ones are the Sahara location and the one in the Linq!
980,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow. I got take out from here at end of June and it was super busy on Friday morning at 11:30am. My friends and I originally had an 11am reservation during a bachelorette weekend but due to conflicting arrival schedules and dead phone batteries, we weren't able to make it and they couldn't confirm seats at noon. A few of us decided to take the monorail over to the Linq and see what was so great about Hash House. Welp, they don't call the meals massive for nothing! The bride to be placed our orders at the front and the employee was super understanding when we realized the online Yelp menu is a bit outdated and some items aren't offered anymore. 

I ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles. O.M.G. How could an ordinary chicken breast be so perfectly crisp and flavorful outside but be so dang juicy on the inside?! It was so good I picked up the whole piece and just bit right into it! And this is coming from a girl that removes the skin from her chicken. The fried pieces of sage weren't that bad either. Not sure if I could actually eat those but I lived. When I first got my order I thought they gave me a pizza instead because it's a box of that size. Huge. 2 white meat pieces and oh! Almost forgot about the four waffle squares sliced with whole bacon stuffed in it. Didn't care much for the bacon and the waffles got kind of soggy but they tasted like buttermilk. 

Not sure what everyone else ordered so I can't comment on other items. To go orders (in person only, no phone orders) take around 40 minutes to prepare when it's busy so it's convenient to go back down the escalator you came up from and explore the casino, grab some coffee from Nook Cafe, or maybe something stronger from Purple Zebra. Whatever floats your boat."
981,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This restaurant was highly recommended and the menu sounded delicious so we tried it. All the food served is massive and tastes good- definitely share plates. The restaurant itself is extremely loud and we were sitting next to a family whose mother had a few drinks and was obnoxiously loud and annoying. We were by the kitchen area where servers were going in and out and a manager was berating a server right behind me and I could hear the whole conversation. Not professional.
In response to comment posted by restaurant: the whole restaurant was loud and I was stating the atmosphere in the restaurant for others to know. I realize the obnoxious lady next to us was not the fault of the restaurant, it just didn't help with our experience. I am surprised that your comments did not mention the lack of professionalism between management and staff. The conversation I heard behind me should have taken place away from customers."
982,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy crap pretty much sums up my experience at hash a go go. First off, expect at least a 45 min wait on Sunday brunch. And yes other people will wait too. When we finally got in we ordered the sage fried chicken and a brown sugar banana pancake. For 2 people this was more than enough to share! We even had left overs! The chicken was juicy and was on top of 2 eggs benedict, biscuits and a mound of mashed potatoes. Get a side of sausage gravy and the Chipotle sauce on the side. You won't regret it. 

The pancakes. Omg. I'd come back just for the pancakes. The brown sugar added a caramelized crunch and the bananas were the perfect combination. You didn't even need to drown your pancake in syrup bc it already has some sweetness to it!

Go there.  And come hungry!"
983,Hash House A Go Go,4,The cold brewed coffee is fantastic. I ordered my favorite fried chicken and waffles.  The seats are low the table is high and I am short. The service and staff are great.
984,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was not looking forward to my return visit to Hash House, or rather, the six-pack hiding somewhere under the remains of my last visit to Hash House wasn't. I decided ""only"" to order a pancake - one maple-bacon special pancake - and when it came out it looked as pictured. My low-key choice became the wow moment of our meal.

I only put about half of it away, but I gave it a good try, strategically working through the most bacon-y parts. These are full slices of bacon on top, glazed with maple, and then pressed down into the pan to caramelize the whole top of the pancake. And...release...the slow clap....."
985,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The novelty of hash house a go go is that it's open 24/7 and that its portions are grossly huge. You will definitely get your money's worth here. An entree cost about $15 avg and can feed a hungry pair or three people who aren't starving. 

The first time I came I ordered the mushroom, sundried tomato, and artichoke hash. To my disappointment, the ""hash"" was actually home style fries/ diced breakfast potatoes, NOT SHREDDED, PAN FRIED POTATOES. It still tasted good, but would have been better as the hash I know! 

The second time I came I ordered the chicken pot pie. If I thought the hash was a big portion this was just gluttonous. I could have split the dish with 4 other people and left full. It tasted amazing until everything started to taste the same...

The wait here can get pretty lengthy. On my first visit I forgot to bring my ID along with my diamond member card and had to wait 30 min for a party of 3. On my second visit,I was granted diamond member perks and was able to skip the line. What frustrates me is that on both visits there are plenty of tables and sections open but there is always a huge wait. I understand saving seating for diamond and vip members, but to waste the amount of table space is truly a disgrace!"
986,Hash House A Go Go,4,Very good breakfast! A long wait but I guess that should be expected for the food. Definitely made with quality ingredients and the portions were perfect.
987,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First spot I ate after my flight in because I knew I had to hit this place! The host was a little short with us and didn't explain well where to stand and why when we came in. After that the waitress was great and quick! Very busy time, about 2 pm, but we did not feel rushed! We both got the sage chicken and waffles and wow, HUGE portions but so yummy!! I will be back and plan to split this 2 chicken piece and 4 waffles. There's bacon in the waffles...bacon!"
988,Hash House A Go Go,5,When friends visit Vegas they always ask about Hash House. I think it is because of the TV shows featuring their creative creations
989,Hash House A Go Go,4,Went here for breakfast based on yelper ratings. The portions are HUGE! One order could easily fit two and plus ordinary stomachs. The fried leek or scallion was also tasty.
990,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I don't have too much to add as other reviews have pretty much hit the spot. This place is alright. Not the best breakfast ever, but decent. But it's disappointing because the menu looks SO good! But it comes in as just decent.

Food: HUGE, HUGE portions. My husband and I split an order Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. We still didn't finish it. It's definitely good for 3-4 people. He also got a side order of biscuits & gravy. Being from the south, he said the gravy was terrible & tasted burnt and didn't end up touching it the rest of the meal. The biscuits on both of the plates were unseasoned, bland, floury. I got a side order of the crispy potatoes, which I used to replace the mash & biscuit on the chicken benedict. Those were delicious.

Service: We got there not too early on a Thursday morning. Maybe just around 8am. We got seated almost immediately. Service was friendly (nothing special), but definitely very slow. When we left there was a huge line of people waiting.

Overall, I don't think it's worth it if you have to wait more than 15 minutes since service is already slow and it is damn pricey (but on par with the rest of Vegas). If you do decide to eat here, beware of the portions. For the price, you should really just aim to split and if you're craving something else, get a side order instead of a separate meal."
991,Hash House A Go Go,5,"In all honesty I have eaten here multiple times and the food is on point. The portions are huge, the food is delicious, and the price is right. Boom baby, defiantly eat here"
992,Hash House A Go Go,1,"All everyone needs to know is that this was by far the worst meal I've ever had. If you care to get more details, please enjoy the read below.


My issue with this restaurant is with the food and nothing else. I ordered a cheeseburger, and my fiancÃ© ordered an eggs benedict. My burger came out 11 minutes before her breakfast, causing my food to become cold. On top of that, I told our waiter that I was displeased with the presentation of my meal, because the fries on the plate were so bare that it looked as if someone had eaten off of my plate before they gave it to me. My fiancÃ©'s meal was the worst tasting food I've ever had. The potatoes were bland, the eggs were under-cooked (she ordered over-hard eggs, and they came out too runny to even be considered over-easy). The water they gave us was horrible, it tasted like they scooped our drinks out of the hotel pool.

Overall, this restaurant and the staff didn't care about providing a quality breakfast to help start the day off right. I will never come back to this establishment."
993,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This restaurant is located inside the Imperial Palace.   Based on that fact, I totally didn't expect this place to be as awesome as it turned out to be.  My friends and I only tried this place out because my bf's sister (a major foodie) said that they had a good breakfast selection.  

The bf and I shared:

- Fresh Market Tomato Salad: If you're gonna try a salad, try this one.  What won me over was the griddled crispy Parmesan cheese that topped the salad.  It was soo goood.

- NY Times Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower:  Okay, this is seriously something you HAVE to try when coming here.  There's BACON in the waffles.  Crispy fried chicken is so perfectly crispy.  Then there's the leek on top?!!  I loved it.  I personally didn't like to combine the two but I also didn't mind eating it side by side.  What can be wrong about fried chicken??? And there's definitely nothing wrong with waffles.  The two make a very nice couple.

I was also able to try one of my friends':

- Stuffed Burgers (you get to choose from about 3 different stuffings - he tried mashed potato, bacon, and cheddar cheese): I thought the burger was okay...it was a little bit on the dry side but all in all, I like the combination of flavors in the 1 pounder.  

The service was decent.  We liked our waiter.  He knew the right times to come by.  I like the atmosphere.  Very diner like.  Apparently a lot of famous people come here so you can check out their wall of fame, which is pretty cool.


The hotel itself is so sucky but I guess not horrible.  The place reaks and I wouldn't stay here again (was here for the cheap prices haha).  BUT do come here for this restaurant :)"
994,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was excellent. Serving sizes are enormous! The quality of the service the service in a place so busy was top notch!
995,Hash House A Go Go,2,Meh. Best Chicken and Waffles? I don't think so. The waffle was pretty but it had flaccid fatty bacon baked into it. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy but the skin was also flaccid. The Kokomo meatloaf sandwich was dry and flavorless. Service started off good but the waiter never came back to see how we were doing.
996,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Fun food.  Obscene servings for those without taste.  A novelty kinda joint.  Think man vs food activity.  There's a hint, and i mean hint of quality but you are going to be overwhelmed by the theme.....  quantity over quality.   Went with group of five.  No one enjoyed things.  Were really impressed by the size of the presentation but quickly realized that's all there was.  Fluff.   Lots of fluff.  The items are great on paper.... ""bacon stuffed waffles, fried chicken, etc.""  But much of this stuff ends up filling the plate like war debris in a search for the food.  

I walked away feeling like a fat american cliche.  Seriously, this place is the icon of everything diabetic about this country.   Have fun with that."
997,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is great and served quickly.  The portions here are absolutely massive so you'll almost definitely need to share a meal or get lots of takeaway boxes.  The pancakes are about the size of a pizza.
998,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best Breakfast I've had in Las Vegas...Huge portions !!! It can feed 3 people easy! Sage Chicken Eggs Benedict-- awesome!! huge pancakes and they are good too... The service is great!  Very friendly staff!  Would love to came back here again!
999,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It was too much food. Good food - but  - no lie - too much food......

Sadly - we sat in a location where we felt like we were breathing in casino smoke directly.... And the casino is downstairs!!!

So - if you are not a smoker - and you have little ones.... Try a different place. We won't return.

The food is delicious, the service is great.... But it is too much....Making foot long pancakes for shock value is not ok....."
1000,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Atmosphere is decent. Prices are pretty high also. Bbq chicken sandwich was pretty good however. I wanted to check it out as this was one of the ""triple D"" spots.  Nothing really blew me away but it didn't disappoint. If prices were more reasonable then it might be more attractive, but then again it is in a casino."
1001,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This restaurant is located in one of the crappiest hotels on the strip (Imperial Palace), but it's definitely a hot spot for brunch.  

My bf and I shared the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, which was freaking HUMONGOUS. We weren't even able to finish the entire thing between the two of us.  Our friend got the fried chicken and waffles, which was also huge and looked delicious. I tried a bit of the waffles which had chunks of bacon in it, which I thought was good, and i don't even like bacon!

Overall, the food was good, but next time I'd probably opt for the fried chicken and waffles. The fried chicken benedict kinda had too much going on, as gigantic as it was, with the mashed potatoes, chicken, eggs, biscuit, etc. Overall, it was a good and satiating meal and I'll definitely come back during my next trip to Vegas!"
1002,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You shall find this amazing breakfast/brunch restaurant inside the Quad Resort & Casino.

Came here during early Saturday morning and there was no line at all. Service was top notch - probably the best service I've ever had for a breakfast place. 

Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles (two chicken breasts w/ hardwood smoked bacon, waffle tower, hot maple reduction, fried leek - $16.95, New York Times Favorite) - First of all, I was completely astonished by the decoration. It was such a simple piece of art - fried leek stick on top of fried chicken. Honestly, fried chicken wasn't mind-blowing (not super juicy, but not horrible either). The bacon-infused waffle was interesting, but wasn't as fluffy and great tasting as I thought. Nonetheless, fried leek was pretty good! 

In terms of taste, I would probably give 3.5-star. However, their amazing / friendly service, huge portion of food, and beautiful decoration (the ""surprise"" factor) definitely enhanced my overall dining experience. I am more than happy to come back here and something different next time."
1003,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome first time experience. I love my waitress Sue. Her customer service was exceptional. The food was great and the entire staff was pleasant and welcoming. I will be returning to this wonderful restaurant. Awesome job keep up the great work.
1004,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fantastic breakfast foods in a very convenient location. $40 got us two drinks and two breakfast combos. The French toast was very thick but not too eggy, with a whole cooked banana on top. The meatloaf hash was also excellent- the potatoes especially were standout. There was no wait at the restaurant, which was also a pleasant surprise"
1005,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My second time coming to Hash House I tried the location at Imperial Palace. I tried the French Toast...oh my goodness the best I have ever had! They are topped with banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup! 

My first visit to HH I tried the Sage Fried Chicken and waffles and it was ok, but the french toast is much better!! 

The portions are very large so it is a good idea to share :)"
1006,Hash House A Go Go,5,Highly recommended.... Delicious dishes and portion is ginormous. Coffee n other drinks are simply superb. Can't leave this place whenever I visit Vegas.
1007,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing breakfast! Quality food and the portions are huge. Very fast BLT bloody Mary.
1008,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service is ok, I had to ask several times for the same item (a fork).  The food is over abundant and poor quality.  I was hoping for something a little better in quality, but when your in Vegas at a lower end restaurant what should you really expect?  Music is also very loud and there is barely any cell reception that's why there are signs for free WiFi, however to get it they want you to install the Vegas app.  Just go to the App Store but don't install it and you bypass their entire process.  Overall unsatisfied."
1009,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Yikes! I hate giving any place less than 2 stars..but i'll explain why. I've been to the Hash House A Go Go location in San Diego and remembered it being a great experience, with awesome food, on par services, and overall a fun experience. So much so, that when I realized there was a HHAGG at the Linq, i convinced all my friends to go. 

So the issue really isn't the hour-long wait. It's a popular brunch place, hence, the long wait time was a given. The issues arise with the quality of the food and the service of the staff members. I would have to say, first and foremost, that our waiter was great. He was always checking on us and was the saving grace to the entire experience. 

Starting from checking in, we were provided with an extremely negative attitude from the hostess. Every time we went back to check-in to see our status on the list, we were presented with an inpatient, rude, and crass response. I understand the job is stressful, to say the least, but seriously? Do you have to be so rude to your customers? My friends and I were trying to fathom if our treatment was due to fact that we were a younger-ish party consist of POC. She seems to have been much nicer to the older, non-POC clientele. 

Moving on, after waiting about an hour, you're asked to check in with the other hostess. Make sure your entire group is present. Otherwise, you'll have to wait again (that's standard). We were then asked to wait next to the fork for another 15 mins before we were seated. 

Once seated, our orders were taken, another 30 minutes passed before our food presented to our table. The saddest part of this experience is that after all the anticipation and wait, we were so excited to get our food, which looked amazing! However, the food was underwhelming. Like another  yelper wrote, we had such high hopes that were squashed. The portions were huge. 3/6 of us got the fried chicken with waffles and felt that the chicken was mainly all batter, lacked flavor, and the waffles were dry. 

I ordered their roast chicken skilled and was immediately disappointed that it was cold... lukewarm. I didn't complain since by that time, I was STARVING and did not want to wait another 30 mins for my food to be warmed. 

Anyhow, long story sort..apparently you can make a reservation? So try that option. Be willing to wait a long time for a large portion of food that looks great, but really, is not great for your tastebuds, and probably will make you feel sick after. We did enjoy the cold brew coffee.

I would say, try to wait until you visit San Diego or possibly another location. NOT WORTH IT!"
1010,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait was about 1hr. One of my girlfriends ran down to get us a table while we got dressed. Once your seated all I can say this place is the bomb.com. The waiter was amazing and the food portions are bananas, I couldn't finish my food at all and the drinks are amazinggggg. The only downside was that we were in a rush  to make it to our ATV appointment and the waiter too forever to bring a check and our last drinks, we waited like 30 extra mins. Other than that I would def recommend everyone to try this place during your Vegas trip"
1011,Hash House A Go Go,3,"3 stars because of the service, but overall food was great. I ordered the tractor trailer combo with an upcharge for a brown sugar pancake. Very large and filling. However, our waiter, Mick, put a bad taste in our mouth. He wasn't attentive, which is understandable because of how busy it was. However, he was extremely rude regarding a miscommunication. It is very loud in there and the waiters talk fast so it's hard to understand exactly what you're adding on as extras. My fiancÃ©e wanted to take off something he didn't realize was added on and Mick was rude and explained how we were wrong rather than just taking care of it (he did end up taking the charge off). At this disappointing service we decided to tip 15% (we always do 20%). They ring you up right at the table and the only tip options were 18% and up so he did a custom tip of 15%. Well, apparently when you do custom tip it's not in percentages so he mistakenly tipped 15 cents. Mick called my fiancÃ©e out on it and before we could remedy the situation he walked away all pissed. We ended up leaving a cash tip on the table because we felt bad but at that point he deserved no tip. Hopefully when you go you end up with a better waiter."
1012,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG, loved it.
we stayed at the Imperial Palace (not our first choice) but easy location to get around from. I had heard a few things about this place and even though were from the South, i had to try this place that claimed to have great chicken and waffles.
 First off, the styling of the dishes were awesome! these towering piles of delicious baked, fried and smothered goodness were art pieces. 
deciding how to take your first bite is tricky. I had the chicken Benedict and Joey had the chicken and waffles. He loved his and offered a bite, but i couldn't even try his as being in love with my own dish. To say the portions are huge is an understatement, half of it was leftovers (which stinks if you're in a room without a fridge and microwave) 
This was my favorite place to eat during my last visit to Vegas and instead of waiting until the last day, i'm going first to Hash Hash a go go."
1013,Hash House A Go Go,5,Packed in the mornings and for a damn good reason. Their breakfasts are delicious. Wear some stretchy pants because the portions are huge.
1014,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hash House is a chain and the location on the strip is upstairs in a semi sketchy casino.  The decor and menu make it seem like it's farm fresh but it's definitely not - don't let them fool you.  The portions here are disgustingly large - each can be shared by 3 - 4 people.  The price is incredibly cheap compared to most Vegas prices though.  The food was decent, but really the appeal is the size of the plates.  Definitely makes you feel like an ass when you walk outside and there are homeless people though - be a decent person and give them your leftovers - there will be a lot of them."
1015,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wait time was crazy, crazy long, but we enjoyed our food (it was almost noon and we hadn't had breakfast yet) and bloody marys, although they could've used a bit more spice.  Made sure to order the ""Budweiser in a bag"" to chase our bloodies.  Portions are large enough to share...unless you are really, really hungry.  The woman next to us had a plate with four waffles and two or three large pieces of chicken, the lady at the end of the bar had a pancake that was about an inch thick and covered her entire plate!"
1016,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The main reason why I wanted to eat here was because I saw this place on man vs food. 

I had ordered the Sage chicken Benedict, which is basically what Adam Richmond had ordered on man vs food. 

This food had many layers and each layer complimented one after another. 

Mash potatoes, grilled cheese, fried chicken, biscuit, smoked chipotle sauce, and bacon. 

I would definitely come back here again just not before going to EDC."
1017,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I make a visit to Vegas 4 to 6 times a year and most visits I walk down to this joint which is located in the Linq.  As you can see in all the posted pictures, the place is unique and the lines are usually appropriately long.  If you are a Caesars Diamond player, you can always bypass this line for immediate seating. (One of the best perks. But I feel guilty for like...5 seconds, but then I immediately forget those waiting.)

I usually hit this spot as my breakfast.  It's good recovery food and prepare your tummy for ur next Vegas adventure.  I start with mimosas or this last time I tried the BLT Bloody Mary (which was bomb.). I hate paying for alcohol on Vegas so I never order more than two drinks here. 

Portions are HUGE...so I usually order just the basic eggs, sausage, toast and then I just eat off others plates --otherwise there is a bunch of wasted food.  We have tried Togo boxes, but in Vegas, there is sooooooo much food, who wants left overs?  I have also tried the corned beef hash--very good. But prefer cheddar instead of Swiss cheese.    

Service is good 
Food is good. 
Portions are generous. 
Atmosphere is fun
Recommended"
1018,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've only been for breakfast, but it was downright amazing! The chicken and waffles (with bacon strips in the waffles!) were so good, and the portion is so large it could have fed all 4 of us at the table. I'll definitely be back."
1019,Hash House A Go Go,2,Don't waste your money or appetite in this place. It's dark and dingy and they are slow. The food is worse than A back alley diner. I'm not upset and posting this due to any bad service. My waitress was kind. This place just sucks.
1020,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food was good. Portions feed two people. Even if your like me and don't like to share with people...SHARE! It's WAY too much food for one person. The wait staff were friendly and the wait time was not at all. If you're looking for a fun new place to try! It's a definite winner!
1021,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I thought I reviewed Hash House before, but I guess not.

I've been to HH 3 times and really if you come to Vegas, you should have heard about this place already.  HH is a place you go out of your way to get to enjoy.  The servings are HUGE, the food is excellent and creative and it's just another one of those one of a kind Vegas type restaurants.

Everything on the menu has a little twist to it and it's just delicious food.  Understand that the portions are big, most meals can feed two people, so you may want to keep that in mind when ordering.  The problem with that though is you want to try everything!

Recommendations:
Fried Chicken (with or without waffles)
Banana and Brown Sugar Pancake (sugar overload but flippin delicious)
Bloody Marry and hell, throw a slider on it

Great for breakfast or late night.  Inside of the LINQ hotel (whatever the hell that is), the hotel is a major crap hole but don't let that scare you away from HH."
1022,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food was amazing. You need to try it if your visiting Vegas. I had banana French toast it was delicious.
1023,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place is as good the first time. The second time around the server sucked and was not engaged at all. She rushed us to take our orders & the food came out way later than it should have been. We also got the wrong order, the food looked amazing but was cold. I was better off going to a Denny's or ihop then here."
1024,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go was one of the greatest experiences I've ever experience. I has Breakfast here with my boyfriend and my boyfriend had the original flapjack meal and I had the banana French toast with pecans. 
The waitress did tell us it is big portions and we saw our food we were shock of the size and portion of the meal. Everything looked so delicious and it was so tasty. 

I would say this place is really good, however it does get very busy so make sure you either have a reservation or go during a time that isn't busy because you will wait up to about an hour or two because it's a very popular restaurant lucky for us we only waited 5 minutes. 

When I'm in Vegas again, definitely going back to this place it was so delicious and the atmosphere of this place is great too."
1025,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When we decided on eating breakfast at Hash House A Go Go - we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. The wait wasn't too bad for a Saturday morning - about 30 minutes for a group of 4. After we looked over the menu, the 3 guys I were with saw the Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict (featured on Man vs. Food) and felt like they were up for the challenge. They had no idea what to expect. 

I decided to go light (or what I thought would be light) so I ordered 1 single flapjack and a biscuit with gravy. 

While we waited for our food, we order Bloody Mary's and Tangerine Mimosas. They were delicious and full of flavor, but be prepared to spend $8.50-9.50 on each drink. 

When our food came out, everyone in the restaurant's jaw dropped to the ground. It was GIGANTIC! Honestly, I don't even know what was exactly on each of the guy's plates. But it was a mountainous pile with a knife stick out of it. The plates themselves are about the size of 4-5 dinner plates! 

Then I was handed my pancake plate...oh my gosh! It was 16 inches round and as fluffy as a chocolate cake! I was hoping they forgot the biscuit because there is no way I would be able to eat all that. 

In the end, none of the guys finished their meal although they tried. It was recommended by the waitress to not eat the biscuit or mash potatoes and you should be able to finish it (isn't that really NOT finishing it?). I split for my pancake into fourths and gave each guy a slice. I didn't even finish my slice. Everyone loved the pancake- I don't think I have ever had a better pancake and especially not at a restaurant. 

We were told the pancake at dinner time is 5x larger than the breakfast pancake. I can't even imagine. 

I would recommend it to anyone, as the food was good and it was full of laughter and fun. It is something you have to try at least once."
1026,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great experience!

There is a separate elevator that takes you directly to Hash House A Go Go.  The portions are EPIC sized here, you will not leave hungry.  The menu has a lot of choices, and this location is open 24 hrs, bonus!  Share a meal with someone here.  The chicken and waffles are my favorite item here!"
1027,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Tried this place maybe 3-4 times and I still don't understand the hype around it. The chicken and waffles just wasn't that great. I ended trying one of their steak dishes and it was the chewiest steak ever. It was just disappointing to come here and think that it will be better, but it wasn't. The s'mores coffee thing was pretty good though. Other than that, everything else was a let down."
1028,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place was awesome. We had the scrambles and couldn't finish it. The eggs were perfect and loaded with flavor. The fresh strawberry jam was amazing and so good on the homemade biscuits. Would go back in a heartbeat. Wait time for two was only about 10 min.
1029,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A few days ago, my family and I were all hungry bears ready to chow down on some brunch in LV- what better to do than visit the tourist trap that is Hash House A Go Go? Initially, this was not my idea: my brothers girlfriend suggested it, so we all tagged along. Pleasantly surprised. 

1. Smores Mocha: Snooping through previous Yelp photos at HHAGG, I found this delicious mess of a concoction and decided to order it to share with everyone, which by the way was a great call because the mug was H U G E. The whole fam passed it around and we still didn't finish it. A sweet mocha beverage with a marshmallow topping, topped with a graham cracker, chocolate drizzle, and a dusting of cocoa powder.  

2. Bloody Maria: Alright, so the only reason this place got 4 stars is because of the Bloody. It was probably the worst Bloody I have ever had, in my life. No exaggeration. Reason being: it was over-doused in black pepper. Also it tasted more like ketchup than a Bloody. At first I thought it was just me, so I offered it to the rest of the family in case someone else wanted it so it wouldn't go to waste. Nope. 

3. Chicken Pot Pie: H U G E. We were not expecting the pot pie to be this large, it must have been enough to feed two people at the very least. Very cool presentation, the pie crust/covering was tilted upward to reveal the delicious pie filling. Flavor deserves five stars, we took leftovers home and huddled around to snack. 

4. Sage Chicken & Waffles: Where do I even begin with this (similar thoughts when it was right in front of me)? A DISPLAY: bacon stuffed waffles stacked under a pyramid of delicious fried chicken with a side of maple syrup, topped with a few sprigs of sage. Again, this was yet another thing that was H U G E. Enough for two people... But only for me. The fried chicken was perfectly flavored with that hint of sage peeking through, however the waffles were a little much. I did not know that the bacon would be stuffed into the waffle (the menu did not specify), and I actually would have preferred it on the side! But I just pulled the piece out of the waffle and ate it without. Still delicious. 

5. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken: So, this is the Sage Chicken & Waffles, save waffles and add cheese + chipotle cream sauce + scrambled eggs. H U G E. Comes with a side of fruit. Delicious. 

They were also running a pretty cool special: show them your tattoo and they'll give you 25% off! Check. 

Would definitely come back, and maybe share some stuff the next time around ;)"
1030,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Whenever I recommend places to check out in Vegas I never fail to mention this establishment. The food is phenomenal, the drinks are superb, and the service is fantastic. Make sure to bring your appetite because this place does not play around with their gigantic portions. Definitely a place you have to check out on your journey to food euphoria."
1031,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash house a GOOD GOD!! I swear they put a piglet in a compressor, fried it then slapped in on a bun lol"
1032,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Not as good as their flagship out on Sahara, but this one's right on the strip, although with the renovation you have to wade thru some dust and scaffolding to get here. The portions were just as monstrously large though, and this time we split 2 dishes among the three of us lightweights, and we left full having not even finished either of them. I'd have picked the chicken and waffles for sure but democracy won out. Here we tried the chorizo skillet and the Tractor Driver Combo. The chorizo skillet was good, although the one tortilla it comes with is inadequate for the amount of filling it comes with. The tractor driver combo we upgraded to a banana pancake which was well worth the extra dollar. Service was excellent. 

The experience at their standalone restaurant on Sahara was better in terms of the atmosphere, the food, and the overall experience, but this was still fine."
1033,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The food and service just became soooo bad now. It took a hour to get our food after we seated. Chicken waffle is not that crispy. The original egg Benedict, WTH, taste like mashed potato mixed with ketchup.  I've been here 3 years ago and was much better. Sooooo disappointed. Never come back again."
1034,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I LOVE HASH HOUSE A GO GO! 
No complaints here.
Staff is amazing. 
Food comes quick!
The portions are HUGE! So maybe think about sharing your order. 
Everything was good! Place was clean!
Im a fan for sure."
1035,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First let me say that I love that his location serves brunch until 5pm! I wake up at like 2pm so this was hugely convenient to me.

One of my best friends tells me all the time how good this place is and I'm happy to say I agree. The portion was much more than I needed but it was all so delicious I nearly ate all of it. The eggs were perfect, the crispy potatoes were great (they aren't hash browns. The waitress told us they don't carry hash browns), the biscuit was huge and they did give me strawberry jam so I don't know what the person below means about no jelly. 

The only problem we encountered why my boyfriend's bacon was a little dry but as soon as he told the waitress, she came right back out with new bacon and he said it was perfect. 

Speaking of the waitress, she was wonderful. i believe her name was Heather if the management happens to read this. She answered  my questions and explained everything in great detail so I really knew what my options were. She had a great demeanor and was probably the best waitress/waiter I had in Vegas. 

I will definitely be returning on my next trip. And being 24 hours is a huge plus!"
1036,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Pancakes bigger than my head? With a side of bacon? Yes, please. Without a doubt, best breakfast on the strip. Portions are HUGE so I'd probably share a meal next time. Servers are attentive. There was a short wait to get in (~10 minutes). Not bad for a busy place. I even got to see a photo of Adam Richman (Man v. Food). Booya!"
1037,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Too overwhelming!!!  I did not know that this place is known for its portions. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken Benedict and I ordered the chicken pot pie.  Big mistake. We should have just shared one item. The Benedict was decent. A couple of bites were good enough for me. Everything as too creamy, rich, and heavy for my taste.  It was literally a ""pot"" pie alright. I felt like they served me a large pot!  I'm not kidding you. It was THAT big. It was good but nothing spectacular. Your typical pot pie. I just didn't like the fact that the carrots weren't chopped. I got full sized carrots in my pie. Strange. I also go a Bloody Mary for the wait. A little too bland and watered down for my taste, but the olives and pickles were good."
1038,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Is there a better way to nurse your hangover than having a huge brunch with more alcohol? I don't think so, but if there is, let me know. I woke up early, so I headed downstairs by myself to get some HH. It's always going to be a crazy wait, but since I was by myself I just hung around at the bar until a seat opened. That was much faster than the 45 minute estimate given to me by the hostess.

I ordered a SMOKED SALMON SCRAMBLE ($14.25), which also comes with basil pesto, fresh tomato, brie cheese, potatoes, and a biscuit. I have to say...this wasn't my favorite. The salmon kind of got lost in everything else, and it tasted pretty average. That being said, I HAVE been to Hash House in the past and ordered other things that were better, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. However, the portions were as big as ever, and I ended up taking a third of it back.

I am also going easy on the food because the service was absolutely amazing here. Everyone behind the bar was so friendly and willing to hold conversations with me. My water was constantly being topped off, and I didn't feel like I was there alone at all. 

Come for the food, stay for the atmosphere. Though the food missed the mark a bit for me this time, I know they have winners on their menu. Maybe stick to the choices that adhere more to their ""twisted farm food"" slogan and don't try to go healthy like me.

Food: 3, Service: 5, Environment: 4, Price: 3"
1039,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Quantity over quality and the whole place reeks of cigarettes (older hotel=bad ventalation=go figure).

The only thing that made my stay was the host who told  me at least 5 times during my stay to keep smiling b/c he loved my smile."
1040,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Let me tell you something, a HUGE word of advice...come here with a two day, empty stomach.  I'm so serious.  The amount of food that is placed in front of you is insane.  Makes no sense at all. BUT, I'm not complaining, because it is out of the WORLD good!  Be prepared to wait at LEAST an hour, this place is in high demand, even on a slow day, there will be a wait, I guarantee it. Oh, BUT when we were seated...

I didn't know where to start, I didn't know what I had a taste for.  Well I know what I had a taste for...EVERYTHING!  Instead of being the indecisive person that I usually am at a new restaurant, I went with my gut, I went with what the people liked.  Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles.  All around me, it was being placed on table after table, people taking pictures with it, digging in.  It was only right.

The combination of sweet and savory is probably the best thing to ever happen in the culinary World.  Hash House is genius for this dish.  The first bite that I took, the sage in the waffle came through in the most major way possible.  But, what did it for me, was not just the sage, but the sage mixed with the savory, smokiness of the bacon and the sweet, maple flavor of the syrup.  Then, it's all on your fork with a juicy piece of fried, seasoned chicken.  Oh I was in Heaven.  I had never tasted anything like it!  Then, there were fried leeks all over the plate, I had never tasted those before and it worked.  It all worked so well together.  

I couldn't finish it all.  It was so much, I hated that I couldn't, but it was humanly impossible.  It's definitely a dish that can be shared, but my stingy self, didn't want to share either.  All thumbs up on my end, visiting Hash House in Vegas.  Definitely not all talk, they showed up and showed out!"
1041,Hash House A Go Go,4,Sage chicken Benedict was awesome! Large portions and good prices for Vegas. The smores hot chocolate was soooooo freakin good. i was so full but couldn't leave until I finished it! Going to San Diego and definitely going to try that location out.
1042,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Excellent French toast with bananas and pecans, orange juice tasted fresh squeezed (Yum!). Staff was very friendly and attentive. Portions are large, easy to share."
1043,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Located at the QUAD Casino, the restaurant is upstairs so you have to take the escalator to get to the restaurant.

Came here on a Monday morning at 7:30AM and the place was already half packed and the place only opened half an hour ago. We waited only 5 minutes before we got seated. Although it got really packed and a lot of people were waiting outside by the time my friends and I finished eating, which was around 9:30ish. 

As for the food, I got to say the portions are REALLY HUGE. I suggest if you come with a group of friends, you guys should share. One plate is enough to feed like two people. We only came to this conclusion after our food came out and we were trying to stuff ourselves because we didn't want any leftovers. We were so BLOATED afterwards that we didn't even want to move.

The food it self is good and each plating has a very unique design. They are known for their FRIED CHICKEN, so order it! Their chicken has a very sweet mapley crunch taste. Maple reduction=syrup. My friends and I was so confuse what that meant when looking at the menu. We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles, Indiana Favorite: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/Benedict, and Farm Benedict Hash House Original. NOTE: Their biscuits are HUGE but on the dry side, as well as their mash potatoes and for the waffles that came with fried chicken, it has BACON in it (YES, BACON!!!). Also that dish comes with fried leeks (long leafy onions), LOTS of it, so if you don't like them, ask for them on the side or something. My friend didn't really like it and it got in the way of while he was eating his dish. 

Overall, I would come back again and this time I would know to share with someone instead of ordering a whole plate by myself."
1044,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you've eaten a meal in the past 3 days, you should probably skip this place and wait until you're REALLY hungry, because the portions would challenge even competitive-eaters.  On the other hand, if you don't have some way of cutting the line (we ate at the Linq and we're TR Platinum, so that was our ""in""), it might be 3 days before you get seated.  The lines to get in this place are absurd.  Even if they doubled capacity, there'd still be lines.

The food is not only served in ridiculously large portions, but it's amazingly good as well.  Everything I tried was outstanding, and I only wish I had a fridge/microwave back in the hotel room so I could justify taking some of it to go.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Prices looked high on the menu, but when you got the actual dish set in front of you, you realize that they're more than reasonable.  

Would go back.
Would recommend.
Would split a plate with at least one other person."
1045,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I went here for EDC in 2013 with my boyfriend, now fiancÃ©, and his best friend. The wait was about 30-45 minutes and when we seated a nice waitress came to ask for drinks as we were looking in the menu. Waitress came back with our drinks and we ordered corn bread as an appetizer with our personal entrees as well. The appetizer came with the entrees, which was fine, but we had a problem was the corn bread. It was WAYYYYYY undercooked because it had the slimy texture when we poked at it and I asked the waitress if she can send it back because it was not edible to eat at all. She was kind to send it back and managed to take that off the check!! Our entrees were HUGE! We didn't expect how big the portions were! I remember the best friend had fried chicken, fiancÃ© had breakfast food and I got a chicken caesar with french fries. Even the salad was enough to serve a party of three. 

Overall, I thought that was good. I give this restaurant 5 stars of the amazing service, our entrees were still yummy and had a awesome time. I would go back when there is no line though because I'm not a nice person when hungry!"
1046,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the first restaurant we came to on our recent trip to LV. 
Heard so many great reviews so I had to try it for myself. 
We had a bigger (extremely hungry) group and it was a pretty busy Friday morning so they gave us the option to split our party into two tables. 

My bf and cousin ordered the 1lb burger which looked and tasted amazing! All of our jaws dropped when we seen how humongous the burger was!  Just WOW! 
I couldn't decide what I want because everything they had to offer sounded great. 
I ended up getting the chorizo breakfast and OMG, it was SO delicious! Such wonderful blends of seasoning. However, I did not like the potatoes, even though they are pretty good, I'm just not a fan of chunky potatoes. I asked for a side of gravy for my biscuit and they charged me $3. Grrr. 
My cousin ordered the basic breakfast w/ grilled ham and he loved it! And all my other cousins enjoyed their food as well! 

The portions here are huge! If you come here, I recommend splitting it with someone but beware it may be a little difficult since everything on the menu sounds amazing it may be hard to agree on one thing! This place was a hit for my family and we will definitely come back in the future. 

I hope you all will enjoy this place as much as we did! Enjoy! :D"
1047,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've been to Vegas many many times and I have always wanted to try this place. I finally came during my last trip to paradise. There was no wait which was unusual since I always see this place packed (maybe because we went at 5pm we avoided the dinner rush). My friends and I got seated right away. I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. I was starving so I was really hoping this would fill me up. 

When the dish came.... WOW... it was HUGE. It looked pretty messy, but it tasted amazing. Fried chicken was crispy and juicy, eggs and bacon can never go wrong together. And to make it extra heavy, mashed potatoes and biscuit. I finished everything and had the worst food coma I've had in a while. My friends also enjoyed the food and the large portions. The waitress was super friendly and really attentive. I would definitely come back if I don't go to them buffets."
1048,Hash House A Go Go,2,"At times the food can be pretty good, although big isn't necessarily better.  Predictable setting with the all too familiar BLASTING music making the experience very uncomfortable.  They have a very juvenile approach to dining as indicated by aforementioned music, which in their attempt to be trendy has left them as just another Las Vegas cliche.  If I want music at that level of LOUD I will go clubbing.  My waiter at one point could not hear me as he was trying to take the order.  Requests to lower the music had to be made 4 times, and was met with condescension and eye rolling.  That's OK....word gets out both good and bad."
1049,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wait was what we expected about 40-45 min on a Saturday . Food was insanely huge portions I would suggest only come here if you have a big appetite ! Service was awesome and food was great . The only thing I wish was better is bacon, I'm a huge Bacon lover . All in all it was a fun experience !"
1050,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is awesome! Get ready for more food then you can handle! The portions are gigantic and everything is so good. Lines are usually pretty long but worth the wait. Grab a BLT Bloody Mary while you wait!
1051,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Normal food with a unique looking creative twist. The food doesn't taste all that original. Honestly, it's just ok...but it's a good place to get some inexpensive quickly if you can pull your self out of bed early and make it to the restaurant early enough so you don't have to wait in a long line of people to eat breakfast. Service of quick and food is served warm to hot every time I've eaten here servers and staff are always friendly. Overall 3.5 stars"
1052,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Got the HH hash that has mushroom, artichoke, sundried tomato and fresh spinach that comes with 2 eggs, alot of potatoes and a slice of honeydew and a biscuit. Gravy was extra. At $14.50 without the gravy is kind of pricey but they do give you a large portion. 

Bro got the 2 slices of french toast with a banana and pecans and maple syrup and has 2 chicken sausages, 2 eggs for $14.99

Pros:
large portions.
not too salty.
not too oily. 

cons:
cinnamon bread is too heavy it seems both of us cant finish it.
chicken sausages seem to bland and solid.
no organic options!

Overal this place gives you alot of food."
1053,Hash House A Go Go,2,"While the food was really good I should explain the situation that causes me to rate them so low.

I was with two friends and we split the bill two-ways.  My friends paid cash for their bill and I paid with my debit card.  When I got back to room I discovered the waitress Kortni had charged my account for both bills and kept the $50 cash that my friends paid.

At that point I called the restaurant and spoke to Derrick J. who claims to be a manager, but he neither returned my first phone call after I explained my dispute, nor did he return my second call the following day.  I walked from the MGM just to dispute these charges and still nothing.  

I have made 2 phone calls, 1 in-person visit, and an email to corporate...  nothing has been done and no one has taken the time to investigate.

As far as I'm concerned Kortni stole the $50 cash and the managers are colluding to cover this up... 

The first restaurant I ate at in Vegas stole my money and has refused to do anything about it.

Update: It appears they corrected the issue because the transaction didn't post, so for that in satisfied.  However, their lack of communication was very frustrating, especially for a visitor who cannot easily follow up."
1054,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here around 2am. No wait at all. We ordered the Benedict and Steak and Eggs.  Everything was huge and over loaded with the hash.  Their biscuits are like fist size.  It was okay.  The steak was the only thing that wasn't big, however it was good.  Other items were okay.  I did not like the fact you can't just order a side of pancakes or french toast...."
1055,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Boyfriend recommended this place after he went with his friends. Chicken waffle is a must get item here since it is hash house's special. 
The portion is huge, 2 pieces of Huge fried chicken, and 4 or 5 pieces of waffles (I forgot !) the chicken was amazing fried just right, and the meat still moist. The waffles are a little too dry in my opinion. They are served with this special syrup they made. 

I ordered the breakfast basics: 2 eggs, choice of sausage, ham or bacon, also comes sautÃ© potatoes with large biscuit and 2 pieces of fruit. The potatoes are abit over cooked, sausage & eggs were great & the biscuit is amazing!! 

Next time I think we will try the chicken biscuits since I gave boyfriend half of my biscuit and he ate it with the chicken and said it was super good.

Overall great experience and great food! Notice the portion is huge! Can take home the leftovers for sure!"
1056,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Las Vegas is truly the city of sin.

I must of committed the seven deadly sins, at one sitting at Hash House A Go Go.

Greed -- I wanted the largest, most filling, and most popular (as shown on Man vs Food) dish on the menu, so I went with Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. Heads turned from the neighboring tables as this heart stopping beauty dropped in front of me.

Gluttony -- I devoured and consumed and force fed myself until I finished about half of this monstrosity. There was fried chicken, biscuits, scrambled eggs, drowned in a thick gravy. It was a symphony of sin... so bad yet so good... I felt like I was...

Lust -- making love to this dish. Oh so, wrong... What happens in Vegas, stays...

Sloth -- Zzzzz... food coma.... wake me up before you go-go.

Envy -- Kudos to the people who can finish this in one sitting. Vegas is awesome!! I can't think of a spot in the bay area that would dare serve something like this.

Pride -- Asian pride!! I'm taking this sucka to go!! Doggy baggin it!!

Wrath -- On reflection... what the heck was I thinking?! I know it was Vegas but I'm sure I had consumed my daily recommended calorie intake in one sitting. Stupid, Stupid... Grrrrrrr....

Sloth -- Zzzzz... (oh, I did that one already)."
1057,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was here on what I thought was a non-busy Vegas weekend in a group of 6. The wait at about noon ended up being an hour or so, but we were staying here at the LINQ so it seemed like an easy choice to go eat.

As we walked in, we could see all the HUGE portions of food on all the tables we passed. Maybe it was because everything seemed to have something fried, but it all looked so delicious. The chicken and waffle immediately caught my eye; it was huge pieces of chicken impaled with a knife on top of a tall stack of waffles. Portion wise, I was very impressed. Taste wise, not so much. There was a weird chocolate/syrup/butter lightly drizzled on the plate--very off putting but avoidable. The batter on the chicken itself was okay tasting but there was just too much of it. And I didn't care for the overly sweet syrup to eat with the chicken since the batter already had a slight sweetness too it.

Unfortunately, there was also quite a long wait for the food. Seemed like it was very busy but we ended up waiting 40-50 minutes after ordering for our food to come out. I would say that there was excellent service, and the food is reasonable in cost for portion size. However, taste wise I would even give this place 2 stars; only bumping it up for the good service."
1058,Hash House A Go Go,5,Unless you haven't eaten this month I encourage you to split a meal with someone. Awesome tenderloin. Bacon avacodo burger was the bomb.
1059,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wish we found this place on our first day. We would have gone EVERY DAY! Soooooo good. Highly recommend the HH pancake (brown sugar banana was unreal). Also- split a meal, and maybe get an extra side. The portions are ridiculous."
1060,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you passed by this restaurant you would probably not go in. The decor and atmosphere is very old fashioned diner. Very blah looking. But oh my word! The food is delicious!!!!! The portions are large too and reasonably priced. I split a chicken pasta (pictured) with my friend. We each got a piece of the fried chicken and some pasta. The presentation was great but the taste was even better! Like I have nothing bad to say about the food or the service. The wait staff was very nice and helpful. Highly, highly, highly recommend this restaurant."
1061,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One of those places where there's a line to put your name on the waitlist - crazy! Make sure you're not in a rush when you come here otherwise you won't be in a good mood to eat! Put your name on the list then go enjoy the casino but make sure to come back a little early because I think they quote their wait time a little longer.

My friend and I split the sage chicken benedict. I'm a sucker for all eggs benedict dishes. However, it's not a benedict because the eggs aren't poached, but the scrambled eggs were pretty good! It was a huge sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs served on a biscuit with mashed potatoes. I wasn't able to finish my half of the meal it was so large! 

I wasn't blown away by the taste of the food, but the size was pretty enormous. I'll be back to try their sage chicken waffles next time!"
1062,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The portions here are too crazy. They serve giant portions that are surprisingly super flavorful. 

It was a pretty long wait but worth the experience. 

I came here with my grandma and fiance; fiance had a plain pancake (didn't even need syrup, it was so good just by itself), grandma had the corned beef & hash, and I had the sage fried chicken and biscuits. 

It was all so good."
1063,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'm not sure how many pounds of food we shoveled into our mouths, how many cups of coffee we guzzled, or how many of those fist-sized biscuits we actually finished, but boy was it a lot of food. If you would like to see just how high your food can stack up, I'd recommend the sage fried chicken with waffles (not in the benedict form or the one with a side of biscuits), which you most certainly must disassemble or else your fried goods and buttery waffles of a tower will come tumbling down.

None of us in our party tried each other's food, to be honest, because we were entirely famished by the time we got seated, placed our orders, and saw those saucer plates come at us. Forks were in, mouths were a gobbling as soon as our own plates touched down. I can, however, tell you all about the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and spinach hash, which came with the aforementioned fist-size biscuit, a slice of watermelon and cantaloupe, and 2 over easy eggs (your choice of how you want those babies done).

The hash wasn't a ""hash brown"" (think McD's or Denny's versions) as what I had pictured in my mind. They were the pan-fried type, cut not in thin slices and pieced together as one but thick cuts of diced potato (triangle shaped?) that was not that crispy, especially after sitting at the bottom of everything else on that plate. I was potatoed out after a few bites of my dish (it wasn't like french fries where you can keep going and going..). The toppings were stir-fryed well (i really liked the tartness of the sundried tomato that made the other flavors pop), and lucky for me, there were lots of artichoke hearts. The eggs were buttery and the yolks, which smoothly burst through the whites by the forkful, were perfectly aromatic. The biscuit was soft and fluffy, easily pried open. My gluttonous self would have asked for more butter and jelly if I could, but the waiter took awhile to make it over to our table.

I'm not all that intrigued with ginormous portions, but if I were to venture back, I'd go for the tower of chicken and waffles, one of the gravy dishes, or perhaps a sandwich concoction. I wish their potatoes were more interesting.

PS: The house brewed coffee should not be underestimated. It was smooth, crisp, and light to medium bodied. Perfect breakfast blend."
1064,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place. The meatloaf and chicken pot pie are the best. HUGE servings all me leftovers for 3-4 meals. I always suggest for travelers and take visitors often!!
1065,Hash House A Go Go,2,"All hype?  Honestly the only reason I wanted to come here was cuz I saw it on Man vs Food.  If you're a fan of huge portions you might like his place, but I prefer smaller portions with better flavor.  Wow, I sound like a food snob, but I don't mean it that way.  I just felt the Fried Chicken Benedict had too much going on.  And the fried chicken didn't seem to complement the benedict.  It just added a heavier element to the already heavy ingredients.  We also got a salad and soup which I didn't mind cuz the flavors were there, just in a bigger bowl.  I didn't feel that way about the benedict.  I don't regret trying this place, but I don't think I'd come back."
1066,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you want to eat your heart out, or stuff that belly,or cure a hangover, then go here. This place serves the biggest, and I mean biggest plates I've ever seen. One plate should be enough for two people. All the comfort food looked so good and comforting. Too bad I wasn't hungover, so I went for a healthier option... big mistake. Of course when you're surround with biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak, and other gravy smothered fried greasy food, your healthy food doesn't taste so good. Either way it was good, but I should have just listen to my stomach and went for the good stuff. I will do it next time. If you're going, just do it! Don't make the same mistake and try to be healthy at an unhealthy place. Enjoy!"
1067,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'd wanted to try hash house the last time I came to Vegas for my birthday since my friend kept raving about how much she loves it, but our group woke up so hungover and desperate to go home on Sunday morning that I decided it was best to put it off until next time. This worked out perfectly as I happened to be staying at the Linq this time around. There's a big sign in the lobby with up arrows toward the escalator, you won't miss it.

We came with a party of 4 at around 11 am. As we were coming down the elevator from our hotel room, I asked my friend if she thought there was gonna be a long wait. Another person in the elevator looked at me and said ""hash house? there's always a wait"" which I thought was really funny and an indicator of how popular this place really is. There ended up being about a 45 minute wait so we decided to go back up to the room to get ready since my friend and I had come down in no makeup and pj's.

We were called less than 5 minutes after we came back (perfect timing!) and they told us to stand in this area to wait for a hostess to come seat us. I thought the set up was kinda weird, as no one was really regulating, or at least it didn't look like it, so I felt like anyone could just go up there and act like they'd been called. It took awhile for them to seat us, despite our number being called already which I was a little bothered about.

Their menu is pretty chaotic to look at and it took me awhile to decide what to get. I was stuck between andy's sage fried chicken benedict and the crab cake benedict as both seemed to have pretty good reviews on yelp. I decided to go for the crab cake. My bf and I had heard the portions were huge but decided to get our own dishes anyways so we could save it for if we got hungry later (and so we could try out more than one dish).

Let me just say that ""huge portions"" is an understatement. Two people could order one dish and still have leftovers. However, I was still glad I got my own dish because it was delicious!! The presentation of the food was very over the top and beautiful. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the crab cakes were soooo good. I particularly loved the sauce that came with it, I think it was some sort of chipotle sauce instead of the typical hollandaise. It also came with what seemed like 2 pounds of mashed potatoes underneath which was also delicious, super flavorful and garlicy. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here. The food was amazing and the service was great as well. I think the only thing that I could really say is that their drinks are pretty expensive. The food is too, but I can look past that since they give you so much. I tried the bloody maria which was just okay. I definitely think you could get something better elsewhere for a cheaper price. Also I didn't mention it but my bf ordered the chicken fried steak and the breading on it was suuuuper salty we couldn't even eat it, so I would advise against ordering that. Otherwise, everything else was spot on!"
1068,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Located inside the Linq, just walk on in and walk towards the center of the 1st floor and look for the escalator that will take you up to the restaurant.   Came in fairly early in the morning on a Tuesday and was able to get a seat within a few minutes however by the time I left around 9:30, there were quite a few groups waiting to be seated.   This place is fantastic!  Portions are ridiculously huge however you do pay a slightly higher price for all the food you get.   I got a bloody mary and the sage fried chicken and waffles which ended up being around $34.   Bloody mary was a pretty good size and I couldn't even finish the chicken and waffles because there was so much.  The waffles had good chunks of bacon cooked into them.   Definitely kept me filled for a good while.  Place is most definitely worth checking out if you're looking for some good grubbin."
1069,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Kinda fun place. Very good service and good music playing food came out looking like artwork and kinda tasted like it too. Ha, not really, but it was not as good as it looked. Chicken was over cooked and tough, several of the stacked ingredients were not hot or even warm. I had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was huge amount of food. I can see how if they were on their game it could be really good. Never had a burning desire to eat there a second time but I would try it again. The guy next to me had a pancake that looked really good and was huge."
1070,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Why is this place so awesome? First of all its 24/7. Second, they serve massive portions. I am not even exaggerating how massive it is. One of their entres could probably feed a village and still have leftovers. 
I got the fried chicken Benedict, I think that's what t was called, and my goodness the combination of burnt cheese, fried chicken, biscuits, potatoes, bacon, and with their cream sauce makes it heavenly. That is only for like the first half. Afterwards it gets nasty just cause there is just so much haha.

Definitely would come back here late at night and I recommend getting the sauce on the side if you're getting the Benedict."
1071,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Surprisingly below average. First expect a pretty long wait to get your table of corse because it is in Vegas. Second my wait for the food was around 45 minutes witch was annoying but in my mind this was gonna be the best breakfast ever so It was worth the wait for me. When the food came out I was ready baby!!! AND THE FIRST BITE.....hmm not that good. I got the grilled French toast and a side of biscuits and gravy. I get biscuits everywhere I go just to try everyone's and find the best. This place was not good at all very stale biscuits and cold gravy. Let's move to the French toast, I understand it's grilled however burned should have been the word it overpowered the taste so it did not have much flavor and they give you a tiny little maple syrup to cover 3 HUGE pieces of French toast. Only come here if you are already drunk, I think it would be pretty good then but so is Waffle House. Friendly staff though"
1072,Hash House A Go Go,5,One of my fav places to go eat when in Vegas. Chicken and bacon waffles and watermelon kiwi lemonade is a must when here. U cant go wrong.
1073,Hash House A Go Go,1,This is my first experience here in Vegas and I was told by friends to try this place out because it's really goo. Yes I was impressed with the pancakes and the food but was extremely disappointed with the service and my waiter Damon. We waited more than one hour to get our orders when people who were being seated next to us were getting there orders and leaving way before we even got our plates. The waiter not once came to apologize for the wait or explain the issue or why it's taking long. He never ended up bringing us the water we asked for and when our dishes came about over an hour later he never came to ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything else. If we needed something we had to ask other waiters and they would bring it to us not even our waiter. Horrible service. Makes me not want to come back
1074,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had the Banana & Brown Sugar Pancake. Yes Pancake not pancakes. But man I really couldn't finish this AMAZING Pancake. I wanted too but just couldn't. I even shared it with wife and friends so that tells you how good and HUMONGOUS it was. One of our friends had the meatloaf sandwich and wow that looked amazing as well. My wife had the BBQ pork ribs those also , all together now AMAZING. The service was top notch very nice and helpful if it's your first time. Definitely a must to stop when in Vegas."
1075,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I really wasn't too impressed.  Maybe it was because so many people hyped it up and my expectations were really high. But this is VEGAS, expectations should be high right?  Anyways, we ordered the sage chicken and waffles and the chicken benedict...frankly I was really disappointed with how bland the chicken was, not to mention a little dry.  Presentation of the food was awesome! However, taste fell a little short.  On the bright side, the waffles were pretty amazing! They had bacon IN the waffles!!! Genius idea I tell ya, lol!"
1076,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food here can clog my arteries in a good way.. maybe, it is so good but wow is it not healthy one bit. They are 24/7 diner food, good late night food cravings for breakfast and other food options too.

Service was good and the quality of food was excellent, I highly suggest sharing bc the portion is HUGE, literally. They don't have gazillion of options but that's a good thing to me, I prefer a menu that's not overwhelming with too much going on but a simple menu with a few items in each of the categories."
1077,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The chef in this place takes everything up a notch. The Caesar salad had croutons made out of fried polenta instead of bread. He decorates the plates with fried vermicelli. That makes the plate look beautiful and everything is edible.. All the food was great. Sharing is a must. The waffles and chicken are the chef own creation. They were amazing, unlike anything I've tasted before. The service was good. Highly recommended."
1078,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Chicken n waffles and Chicken Benedict great at 300 am. Play some roulette at O'Shea's , they paid for this meal."
1079,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fast, amazing, and great service. I hated the food and service in Dallas, and was apprentices five this a try. I'm glad I did. Will go back for sure."
1080,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We loved this place, and actually ate there twice during our 5 day vacation in Vegas. We went once at brunch. The wait was suppose to be about 20 min, but we got a table after about 10 m. The second time we went was about 3am so we were seated immediately. The food was amazing (large portions) and the service was quick. This will definitely be going on my go-to list for Vegas vacations."
1081,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was searching for breakfast places near me and Hash House popped up. Loved all the food photos n reviews I saw online and decided to head there.. went Sunday morning. To me it looked busy, alot of people were waiting but we still went ahead and put our names down for a table. Wait was about 15 mins. And it was worth it. Staff was very friendly and service was awesome. We ordered banana latte , hot chocolate, french toast and scrambled eggs and basic breakfast. Food was very yummy. Highly recommended!!"
1082,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Went here with a couple friends after hearing rave reviewsfrom a few sources. I got the #1 scramble and my friends got a buttermilkl pancake and the sage chicken and waffles.  None of us were happy with our food.  The scramble came with fried potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit.  The potatoes were cooked well but, like most of the food we received, was bland.  The biscuit was somewhat dry and had no butter, gravy, or even jam. The scramble itself was quite runny wich was very odd and still fairly bland.  
My friend's waffles had bacon in then and were OK. The fried chicken however had a heavy sage smell which overpowered everything else about it. Had no flavor beyond that. 
The pancake my other friend got was just a big pancake. Nothing special.  The portions were large or average with bare minimal to no condiments (butter, jam, maple syrup).
I do not recommend this place and will not be returning."
1083,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go is a foodie paradise amidst the sea of bad Vegas chains. My buddy and I split the chicken and waffles after watching several dozen pass our table. The 30 minute wait for that puppy was well worth it - perfect amount of food for two people to split. Also, the waffles have bacon IN them...enough said there.

Side note: After putting our name in for a one hour wait, I approached the host stand 30 minutes later and our group of eight somehow got seated immediately during a busy rush. #Priorities"
1084,Hash House A Go Go,5,I went to this place 3 times when I was in Las Vegas this past weekend. We got great service the food was absolutely delicious and very fresh. I will definitely come back to eat here on my next trip to Las Vegas. Heck I think I'll even stay at the LINQ  just to have this place very accessible to me.
1085,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fair prices, amazing food and HUGE portions. Best of all, the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive."
1086,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food looks amazing and the portions are ginormous but...the flavors were all bland.  I ordered the meatloaf...bland (and a little undercooked).  My husband ordered the fabulous looking chicken and waffles and the chicken was juicy but very...bland!  Everything needed salt and the waffles did not have bacon in them and they were very dense and heavy.  We might give it another try but we were actually disappointed considering how great the food looks.  It's unfortunate that the flavors weren't there, or at least they were not there when we dined.  We wanted to love the place but...bland, bland, bland.  :-("
1087,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We really enjoyed this place. If you have any thoughts about what a restaurant in Vegas may be like, this is that place. We had about a 30 minute wait, but that isn't too bad. Our waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating, and food came out pretty fast. I only have two minor issues with this restaurant. First, our food (all four of ours) wasn't very hot, only warm at best. And second, the portions are gigantic, so it would have been nice if either our waitress warned us, or there was a mention of this on the menu. Other than that, the food had great flavor and the presentation was fun. I would go back again, but next time definitely split a meal."
1088,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Yes, bigger portions than your entire body. Doesn't necessarily make it good food, though. I can't say I've had a mind-blowing meal at Hash House ever. The presentation will make your eyes pop out of your head for a sec, but that's pretty much it. Wish they were a little less wasteful with the garnish, too. Why is there a whole rosemary bush and dried spaghetti sticking out of my food?

Last night was my first time going to this location after hours around midnight. My party of 6 was seated quickly and the server came over with waters immediately. I asked for lemon and those showed up later in a kiddie cup. Interesting. lol

Ordered the BBBLT and it was average at best. Was honestly expecting way more bacon, hence the name. Guess sticking to breakfast food here is probably key, although my friend's burger did look really good (and big of course).

Service was just alright, but I kept thinking about Peppermill while we were there, so definitely going there instead next time."
1089,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go is a 24/7 breakfast joint located in the Quad Resort & Casino (formerly the Imperial Palace). They offer an interesting take on American classic diner food.

From eggs & potatoes to chicken & waffles, the menu is extensive and you will definitely find all your breakfast favorites. In addition, they have a good selection of burgers and salads. But IMO, going to Hash House just for a salad is kind of a waste.

After seeing so many pictures on Yelp, I opted for the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. I had to! It was a wise choice and I was not disappointed. It wasn't the best C&W i've ever had, but it was very good. Huge portions, moist chicken and sweet waffles - what a combination. The waffles have little pieces of bacon in them, which are more for novelty than taste. 

My friends tried a hamburger and also a scramble. They both left extremely satisfied with a to-go box. If you're looking for a hearty breakfast, then look no further than Hash House A Go Go. I guarantee you won't leave hungry!"
1090,Hash House A Go Go,5,My favorite restaurant of all time! If there was a hash house in my home town I would eat there everyday. Sage fried chicken Benedict is a must try. I have had most items on the menu and have enjoyed all. Service is always excellent. The restaurant is always crowded unless you go late at night or in the early morning. A must try restaurant!!!
1091,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Since we were already staying at the Linq, we thought it'd be a good idea to stop by for a late night bite after the club. Thank goodness hash house is 24 hours! In my opinion the portions here are huge, it's vegas priced, but huggge portions. We went around 2am. Pretty empty thankfully. We ordered our food to go and we're able to head back to our room within 15 min. I ordered the HH downsize with blue cheese and regular fries. Yes, it was BOMB! Tasted very fresh and super hot in temperature(just the way I like it). My only complaint is the server seemed tired. No enthusiasm at all. No smile. Hats off to the chef though!"
1092,Hash House A Go Go,3,"An uber ride to the back of the hotel later from my own and I was ready to taste the sage fried chicken and waffles.
Sad to report that I should have went with my gut instead of what was popular on the menu. The chicken lacked flavor, and my waffles were just okay. My meal was not good enough to eat even with a side of the delicious tangy soy BBQ sauce I asked for. My husband ordered the meatloaf sandwich which came with some really good tasting fried. His sandwich was also good which saved them from getting two stars. The customer service and decor were good handing them a star... They earned anywhere star because our food wasn't expensive at all. We live in SoCal, so we spend money on food and even our grocery stores are expensive; spending less than $40 for two people was a good surprise which made walking away without finishing my food feel less painful.
My advice would be to try something else besides those sage chicken and waffles."
1093,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We decided to stop here since we were staying at the Linq. We took the servers suggestion and got the chicken and waffles. Also wanted to try the namesake hash so I went the traditional route and went with the corned beef hash. The chicken and waffles were yummy and the bacon baked in the waffles was amazing. The hash was just a miss. My expectations were crispy hash cooked on the flattop. This was pulled corn beef topped with peppers,onions and cheese balanced on top of breakfast potatos. It lacked the texture and flavor of traditional hash and I was very disappointed in it."
1094,Hash House A Go Go,5,I'd say hash House a go go  is some of the best food in town the meatloaf with Marsala wine sauce is to die for the man versus food item on the menu is amazing never had a bad time there always great service always great people every time I bring somebody from out of town to The Hash House they thank me and tell me this was a dining experience not just a meal definitely a must- eat for any foodie or anyone who has not had a dining experience yet it's a you better go kind of situation
1095,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Really wonderful food, enormous portions, and a good value. Our server, Nathaniel, was very friendly and helpful.  There were so many awesome options. I got the chorizo scramble and my friend got the pancakes. Definitely big enough to share or bring home for leftovers. 100% recommended!"
1096,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place isn't bad. For reals, it's not bad. 

You pay a decent amount ($10-$20) and you get a huge portion enough for two. Maybe even 3... so you, your wife/gf, and even a side chick could share all the items Hahaha. Yeah that's how big the portions are. Ignore my comment about the side chick, just thinkin about vegas and how everyone likes to whore around. 

Anyway I ordered the hash hash downsized burger. Yep, down sized. It was $12.99 and came with my choice of cheese, angus beef, and fries. Could've paid a bit more for sweet potatoe fries but let's be honest, no one could finish the entire entree. It's still too big. 

Meat was cooked well. Nice and juicy. Server was good. This place is opened 24/7 so after you go clubbing, go here so you can grub and eat. Perfect place for you and the lady after the clubbing scene. They serve alchy too so if you need to get you (or someone else) even more intoxicated ... well ... yep enjoy. 

Downfall? It was freaking hot in here. I had a jacket on because it was 45-50 degrees outside and once I entered this restaurant, I was sweating balls. Nuts. Anyone good place to eat especially if you're staying at the linq which is a super cheap and legit hotel. Enjoy folks!"
1097,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash house was amazing great service very attentive waiter . The food is served in huge portions and pretty reasonably priced I had corned beef hash potatoes needed to be cooked more but meat was great , my granddaughter had a pancake as big as a pizza . Felt a little rushed as there was a long wait , but well worth the visit ."
1098,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The reviews are right: the portions are enormous. When my wife and I arrived to Hash we noticed that people were sharing their food. We decided to opt out of sharing and ordered our own individual plates and we didn't even finish our food. The brown sugar banana pancake was delicious and so was the chorizo hash. 
The only negative thing to our visit was the service. Although we got seated extremely fast, the waiter wouldn't check up on us."
1099,Hash House A Go Go,2,Had the sage-fried chicken with penne pasta.  Fried chicken was nicely cooked but the sage seasoning tasted a little weird to me.  Two chicken breasts on top of basically a kitchen-sink vegetable pasta soup in a bowl with a big ass sprig of rosemary and three brown sticks of something sticking out of the top.  I just wasn't drunk or high enough to eat it all and appreciate the frenetic snarkiness of the hipster bartender and crew but then I'm not the target demographic.
1100,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Just like everybody else, we got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. It's a large portion intended to be shared. There's four pieces of waffles and two good size pieces of chicken breasts. The waffles are bacon waffles which I wasn't a big fan of. The bacon was too smokey rather than maple so it detracted a little. But the chicken was super on point which made up for any issues I had with the waffles. The sage and a bit of syrup made an amazing combo with the chicken. With their volume, they really know how to fry up a chicken at just the right temperature.

We came a little early so we beat the breakfast rush. By the time we left, the lobby was packed. While we had no wait, the wait by the time we left was over 30 minutes."
1101,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Came here at 5am Sunday morning.  I counted maybe 15 parties.  I counted 5 servers.  I've never worked in food service but 3 tables per server should count as easy, right?  But for whatever reason, our server kept disappearing for long periods of time.  During our meal, the server did swing by once to apologize and explained that they are very busy.  Hmm, not very convincing with the majority of the tables empty.

Two of us had burgers, which we both agreed tasted very, very bland.  Needed ketchup for it to be edible but conveniently enough, the ketchup bottle at our table was completely empty.  Since our waiter was nowhere to be seen, I had to go snatch a bottle from an empty table.  For my order, I opted for a salad rather than the usual french fries.  The server did not ask what dressing I would like, and the salad was given to me without dressing.  When I realized this, the waiter had already disappeared and I was not given an opportunity to ask him for dressing until 30 minutes later.  I asked for ranch but he gave me cucumber ranch.  Whatever.

Another friend had ordered the steak (cooked medium) and eggs special, the steak came out well done and very tough.

In conclusion, bad service and bad food.  This place should just close down."
1102,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge servings, definitely a must go to place while in Vegas, my first time was ok, I definitely need to go again to give a better review."
1103,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was great. But the service was the best! Koti is the best waitress I have ever had very personable and great customer service skills!!! Very happy!!!
1104,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came here for breakfast.  We checked in and waited.  And waited and waited.  The lines were very long.  We finally got a seat and were very excited to sit down and enjoy a fabulous breakfast.  

Food was just ok.  We got the fried chicken/mashed potatoes/egg combo (forgot what it was called) and a Chorizo skillet.  The skillet was far better than the other dish and this surprised me.  The order on the eggs was wrong (brought scrambled-- ordered over medium) and we waited almost until the end of our meal for this to be corrected.  We also had bloody marys and they were also just ok. 

This place is fun; presentation of food is unique and I think it is better than most places for breakfast, but I think Vegas is full of overrated places like these."
1105,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I had always heard of the place, and this time around ,we went with a group of 6 people, and were staying at the Flamingo Hilton, which is on the same side and 2 Hotels down from The Imperial Hotel where Hash a Gogo is.
 We just got off the plane on a Red eye from Honolulu, which arrives around 7 am, so we were ready for breakfast, and a Bloody Mary.
Well, that's exactly what they bring! Bring your appetite, because there portions are HUGE!
We ordered Chicken and Waffles, Eggs Benedict.Hash browns and eggs and their Bacon Bloody Marys! Yes, I said Bacon Bloody Marys, LOL
The funny thing was, on a plate of 4,500 calories, they had the freshest pieces of healthy fruit ever! hahaha
And even if you're not a Bloody Mary fan, you have to order one, just to say you tried one.Just check out my pics!
 Not sure if I would go again, but it is definitely a place to go at least once."
1106,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So so delicious. Wait was only about 10 mins for breakfast. Fresh apple juice is really good here. 
Also had the roasted chicken scramble and it too was very good. Highly recommend this place."
1107,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I had dinner here last night and although the portions are large, the food is VERY bland. While the waitress was taking our order, she wiped her nose on her forearm and just smiled at us. I had the pot pie and my date ordered the chicken and biscuits. The ""gravy"" was the consistency of paste I remember making in kindergarten. I read a review on their website from a diner who found a long brown hair in his fresh roll and all the waitress did was say, ""It's not mine!""
I never received my Open Table points and my review was never posted on their web sit. This place has ALLOT to hide. I wouldn't eat at The Hash House at The LINQ if the food was free."
1108,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food was fabulous. We had the chicken and waffles a bit too much sage for my husbands taste but savory none the less, my chocolate chip pancakes were literally hanging off the plate.  The kiwi watermelon lemonade was delish.  Big portions, two people can share the meal or go on a empty stomach and eat it all.  We went around 1130am on a weekday and waited 25 minutes not bad for a party of six."
1109,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Once again, outstanding! Chicken and Waffles and the Pot Pie were second only to the Bloody Mary's! The staff at the bar was the best ever! Thank you for a great experience."
1110,Hash House A Go Go,1,"HASH HASH A NO GO!  based on a friend's recommendation, 8 of us trekked to hash hash a go go last Friday morning and at 11 there was an hour wait. once we finally got seated we ordered cocktails, which seemed priced fairly, but they were pretty weak. we finally ordered but waited almost another HOUR for our food to arrive. and when it did, NONE of us liked it. most of us ordered the sage fried chicken which was dry and flavorless. we couldn't even taste any salt. one friend asked for a sauce or something to add moisture to her chicken and 20 min later the waitress brought her some ranch dressing. food and service was horrid. I agree with another reviewer...it should be called HASH HASH A NO NO! or HASH HASH A NO GO!! what a waste of our time and money!"
1111,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I typically go here when I'm in Vegas and usually have a pleasant experience, however my last visit wasn't so pleasant. My husband ordered a boysenberry pancake and I wasn't too hungry so I chose a smaller meal which happened to be on the kids menu. The waitress was nice about everything and was great. My food was bought out by Travis who told me I could no longer order from the kids menu because they don't make money on those orders but I am more than welcome to share a menu. I was like WTH how are you not making money on a meal that I'm purchasing if I share you wouldn't be making that. This really ruined my experience."
1112,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've never been to the one off the strip or Socal, but when I heard they opened up at Imperial Palace, I had to go try it out.

Sage chicken and waffles. Loved it!
Juicy chicken, waffles, drenched in syrup. What's not to love??
Plated so beautifully too!

Service was ok. Could get kind of forgetful when they're busy. Wait is not too long if you come at the right time.

Must try others when I return! Good times."
1113,Hash House A Go Go,4,I enjoy eating their fried chicken and waffles! plates are served in big portions and they have  great customer service. this place never disappoints me!
1114,Hash House A Go Go,3,".LONGEST LINE for breakfast...........but it did cure my hangover from the night before.  Waited over an hour to get seated here  - surprised such a popular spot inside Imperial Palace.

My friend warned me that the portions were huge so we opted to split one of the House Hashes and it was the right decision.  All their house hashes are tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit.  We split the Famous Meatloaf, roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and smoked mozzarella.  Food arrived warm and it hit the spot. The carbs cured my hangover. I can't say if it was the best hash i've ever had b/c was super hungry.  But it did it's job. 

Between the two of us this meal only ran about $15 - so it was a good deal for a vegas brunch. I wouldn't say i would wait over an hour again here for breakfast in the future."
1115,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Whoa!!


So i went all the way out and split the man vs food dish with a friend.  Delish and this is coming from someone who doesn't like biscuits, gravy or mash potatoes lolll.

Electric blue drink was really good as well and a great value...kind if a shocker that I only needed one.  ""Defeated"" comes to mind.

Originally I thought it was a nice sit down place.  But its your average chain restaurant/diner feel, however, the staff was attentive and friendly. 

Service with a smile."
1116,Hash House A Go Go,3,Good dinner. I had the chicken sandwich which was ok. My wife had the Chicken Benedict wich was far better than my sandwich.
1117,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here first thing after landing and we were all quite hungry. It was around 11am and there wasn't too much of a wait, and we got seated within 15 minutes. It was a little confusing to get to, but after a bit of directions from the concierge, we figured it out. Most of the complaints about this place stemmed from the wait, but I guess you just have to know when to go.

Anyways, we had heard of the huge portions at Hash House a Go Go, but you really don't understand how big it is until you see it in person. I got the sage fried chicken with the bacon waffle stack, and it was enormous. A kid at the neighboring table got the same thing, and it was as big as his head. I eat a lot, and I was not able to finish it. Thankfully, our hotel room had a full kitchen, so we could store and re-heat everything we didn't eat. 

The fried chicken was on point, and the waffles, albeit a little soggy after awhile, were delicious. There are a lot of other fried chicken dishes, like the benedict, so you can't really go wrong.  I was also able to try the chorizo hash, which packed a good punch, and the pork tenderloin sandwich, which also was humongous. Biscuits were buttery and not overly dry and the gravy was pretty peppery and flavorful. 

Prices were decent and the service seemed a bit on the slow side, but not terrible. Definitely a good alternative to the many buffets on the strip, and you'll be just as full and satisfied. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."
1118,Hash House A Go Go,1,What a horrible place for breakfast first the food was cold and nasty our waiter never ask how the food was the entire place smell like cigarettes will never never come here again
1119,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is very proud of their breakfast and the price reflects that.  The ""potatoes"" I'm sure were frozen and from a bag. No one can brown potatoes equally on every side. They also tasted frozen as some were warm and some not and even cold yet browned like the hot ones. 

Overall it was just an okay breakfast.  Do not be in any sort of a hurry. Is seems to take 20 minutes to heat the potatoes and cook the eggs with only two other guests there. 

manga"
1120,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This restaurant is the only redeeming quality of the Inferior Palace. Come hungry for breakfast and get a flapjack with fresh apple slices. Service is friendly, especially if you sit at the counter. Portion sizes are ridiculous - the chicken and waffles I had on one visit could have fed a family of 4. But it's all delicious."
1121,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love this place!  Enormous amount of food that is sinfully delicious. Unless you have not eaten in days, order one plate and share. The drinks are wonderful. Service was good."
1122,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food. Poor service.  We were seated in the bar area due to a long wait.  Our bartender/waiter forgot to put our order in.  We had to ask for refills of coffee and soda, and we had to ask for cream, jelly and butter.  No compensation was made for the forgotten order."
1123,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've been to the Hash House on West Sahara Avenue in Las Vegas, so I'm familiar with the food and the concept of fresh food. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Quad hotel (formerly Imperial Palace). I look forward to the renovations in the hotel since it is really old with the dirty carpets. In addition, Hash House needs some more lighting. The huge portions never ceases to amaze me. I was already full just eating the biscuit, and I  I had the crab cake dish which came with two crab cakes, mashed potato with butternut squash, and a side of vegetables. Very hearty dish. Our waiter was great, so no complaints there. We had an early dinner around 5:30pm so we didn't have to wait in line. There was a sign posted saying that this place is open 24 hours a day."
1124,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This was my second time here, and it was more disappointing than the last.  My first time here I ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken (the Man vs. Food favorite), and I thought it was ok.  Nothing spectacular at all.  But my friends seemed to have enjoyed their meals a lot.  My friend is a Platinum member of Total Rewards so I didn't pay for this meal, hence nothing to complain about if you didn't pay for it I guess.  Plus we skipped the line, so I didn't have to wait.  I do need to note that the portion here are HUGE, so sharing entrees is an option here.   

This time around, however, I was extremely disappointed in the food.  I came here a second time to see if maybe the food I ate the first time around was a bad day, so I gave this place a second chance.  After this experience, I really think this place is over-rated, and I can't understand why it gets as crowded as it does.  The wait on this particular Saturday was 45 minutes to an hour.  We finally got sat, and we ended up ordering right away since we were all starving.  I kid you not, it took an hour for our food to come.  And our server, Alonzo, noticed this too because he came over TWICE to give us the status of our food.  The first time it was because the table next to us that came 10 minutes AFTER we did and didn't order right away got their food 30 minutes before we did.  Alonzo informed us it was because his manager accidentally  put the food ticket in front of everyone else's.  Ok, fine.  The second time he came around, he apologized for the food taking so long and that it would be coming up.  He must have read our minds both times because we were talking about how long the food was taking.  I know the food is made from scratch and all, but are you churning the butter and digging out the potatoes from the dirt back there too?  Shoot, an hour for eggs and potatoes is too damn long!  I found the service from Alonzo to be very professional and courteous despite the disappointment and delay of the food. 

When we finally got our meal, we were no longer hungry anymore.  The ham, spinach, and cheese scramble was alright, the country potatoes had this weird sour after taste that had such a bad taste in my mouth I didn't even want to finish them, and the crappy home-made biscuits tasted like hard chalk  No, it wasn't fluffy and buttery, but bland, hard, and completely devoid of taste.  I decided that this was definitely a 2 star Yelp experience.  I was so disgusted by the experience I actually felt the need to speak to Alonzo and the manager about how bad it was.  If the food had been good, the hour wait would have been worth it, but no, the wait was a complete waste of time.  While the portions are big, that just means big portions of more tasteless and bad food.    

Alonzo was completely understanding and offered to discount our bill for us.  He understood why we were upset at the experience and did not BS us. I asked him if we could speak to the manager.  This manager guy was less than professional and gave us bullcrap excuses for why everything took so long.  Hey man, your employee already told us you were the reason the guys next to us got their food 30 minutes before we did.  Secondly, I've been here once before and the food didn't take nearly half as long as it did this time around. Just take responsibility for your actions and be honest.  He gave us a 30% discount on our food, but I don't think this was enough to want to return to this over-rated restaurant or recommend anyone to even waste their time going.  I'll just take it as a loss.  However, it was enough to bump up it from a 2 star experience to a 2.5 star experience.   

Despite all this, I don't recommend anyone to go here for breakfast.  The wait is too long for tasteless food.  Las Vegas is renowned for their world-class food, and this place isn't it, people."
1125,Hash House A Go Go,4,"As far as breakfast places go, this place rocks. It's like what you wish every Denny's and IHOP could be. Good, clean and open atmosphere- place is usually busy with friendly faces and the food is good quality! This is my go-to breakfast place if I don't want to cook myself."
1126,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Can't wait to try the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles next time I'm in town! This is great recovery food for those tough hangovers. I had an omelet with hash browns, a biscuit and gravy. The prices were very reasonable and the servers were friendly. They are known for there portions and didn't disappoint. I went for lunch and didn't have to wait for a table."
1127,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Always good, always friendly. Big portion sizes! Share!!! We always stick with the popular dishes and always enjoy it. Not 5 stars because the service was a bit slow, they were sharing one credit card machine. Server was great though, made us feel like friends."
1128,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Worth the wait on a Saturday morning around 11 am. Attentive staff and creative, delicious food. Plan on sharing, portions are huge,."
1129,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here on a Saturday around 10 am. Get here early because this place fills up fast!! Even though the entire entrance was packed, the wait was only about 40 minutes. I tried the hot chocolate and the chicken and waffles with a side biscuit. The hot chocolate is bomb!!! Very rich! The chicken and waffles was pretty good though the chicken seemed was a little dry and overcooked. The bacon waffle was amazing though and the fried leeks added nice texture and savory flavor. The portions a GIGANTIC so if anyone is willing to split meals, I would recommend it. They have a different jam option everyday as well!! Ours was peach and was very good. This place is definitely an experience and worth trying and then trying again and again so you can eventually eat your way around the menu."
1130,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Three of us arrived midday on a weekday. The wait was about 15-20 minutes.

We knew the portions were huge and a doggy bag was not an option. So, we decided to share two dishes. But because they frown upon that, we ordered an additional side so they had no issue with three people chowing down on two entrees.

We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Brown Sugar Banana Flapjacks and a side of bacon. In addition, based on some other Yelp reviews, we ordered the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade.

The lemonade was super potent and overly sweet. Even after mixing thoroughly, it was way too much to drink straight. Since I had an unsweetened iced tea, we added a lot of that to the lemonade which made it bearable. Perhaps cutting it with a portion of water (or tea) would make it easier for most to drink.

The Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles was made to be a visual showstopper. That was all. I was disappointed because I had been worked up by veterans of this dish. Sure, it was a monstrous pile of food with a huge steak knife and rosemary sprigs holding it together. Sure, it had bacon in the waffles. Sure, it had sage fried chicken. But my opinion went down as I started eating it. The chicken seemed overcooked and dry. I couldn't taste any sage. The waffles were more dense and the bacon didn't really add much. The bright note were the leeks which were very tasty, but not tasty enough to save this dish.

The Brown Sugar Banana Flapjacks was really a single flapjack that was so huge it hung over the sides of the plate, and it was already a huge plate to begin with. The flavor was good and a great size to share between three people.

I think the most memorable thing was the side of bacon. I was afraid that it would be overkill because there was bacon in the waffles. But this was thick cut hardwood smoked bacon so it was crispy and juicy and super flavorful. Probably some of the best, if not *the* best, bacon I've had.

Parking at the Imperial Palace was a bit tricky since there weren't easily visible signs indicating that we were entering the IP garage. If you're not comfortable with driving along the strip, I would recommend taking the tram from another hotel on the strip to the IP.

The amount of food you get is a plus, but if this is your first time, I would recommend going with a big group and ordering one chicken and waffles to share between everyone. That way you can try more things on the menu."
1131,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The Hash House is a must. The portions are huge. The best Bloody Mary  ""Johnny famous BLT Mary"". 
This is definately no Diet food, but it is comfort food X 2."
1132,Hash House A Go Go,5,"For all y'all that ain't never been to any of them bomb Hash House A Go Go's you missin out on a hearty meal and dope price. Mah Fat Phucklets know yer boy ain't one to complain about the price of a meal, but I ain't stupid enough to pass up a good deal when I see it. 

At this spot you gettin massive portions and the food tastes bomb. Now if you coming here tryin to eat light and not eat some shit that's gon put you on your ass, this ain't for you bruh. I like me the the Fried Chicken Benedict, but that Chicken and Waffles dank too."
1133,Hash House A Go Go,4,If you came hungry you came to the right place. Good variety on the menu and prices are great considering you will have another meal the next day. Well worth the wait if you see it busy as it should be.
1134,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Talk about breakfast for dinner! After a night out at the club my friends and I headed over to Hash House A Go Go for a late night/early morning meal. I ordered The Tractor Driver Combo, two sunny side up eggs, one sausage, and one (extremely large) Brown Sugar Banana Flapjack! The pancake was absolutely delicious, it had a slight crispness to it from the brown sugar but it wasn't overly sweet. I was so focused on my pancake I almost forgot my sausage and eggs and even then I only ate about a fourth of the pancake. But I assure you that wasn't a problem, because I saved it and ate it the next morning at my hotel, there was even enough to share with my mom and she loved it too! Our waitress was super fun and we had a great time! I definitely will be going back on my next trip to Vegas, or hopefully check out one of their other locations."
1135,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hey Guys! 
I just wanted to take some time and share my experience at this place inside the Imperial Palace. 1st of all i just want to say that the imperial palace is really old and looks very tired and grungy do not let that stop you from eating here.... I had the eggs benedict and its was AMAZING!! the food is huge!! i had it with mashed potatos and a lemonade/orange mimosa!! Now even tho this place was good i probably would not go again it was more like a 1 time thing for me. Still need to try like 100 other ones!

The food is too big and i always end up giving the left overs to  the less fortunate who sit on the bridges/streets.( sooo nice to see them smile )

The food is great but location and atmosphere i did not like."
1136,Hash House A Go Go,5,"SIZE MATTERS. That's all I'm saying. Because for all of the ugly stereotypes about America, and there are plenty, this is the one that I find least offensive.

Gas guzzling SUVs? Can't stand 'em. Big hair? Totally 80s. Urban sprawl? Saddening. But give me a 18"" plate with 5 lbs. of waffles, sage-rubbed fried chicken, maple syrup, and mashed potatoes... and I'll stand up and sing ""Proud to be an American"" with the best of them.

Loved this place in San Diego, and this location is just as good. Not to mention, after you lose your @$$ in the casinos (and look around... trust me... you will...) you can have a $15 lunch entree, split in half, and take leftovers home. THAT big."
1137,Hash House A Go Go,3,"ehhh honestly kinda disappointed! 
I the San Diego Hash house A Go GO so when I saw they had a location in our hotel I was so excited... The service was great I don't remember our servers name bu she brought me extra olives for my bloody Mary I remember that! 
Speaking of the Bloody Mary it was really good. 
But the food hmm not the same quality as the SD Location I was sick all night after eating the burger I know its 1 ilb of meat but I only ate one quarter of the burger and after my stomach ache in the middle of my vacation I realized it was probably not quality meat. 
well when in Vegas  you have to expect  quantity over quality I guess..."
1138,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was wonderful! Although the wait is a little long, it was worth it. They served me Cap'n Crunch in a nice ceramic bowl with milk on the side to make me feel like the adult I am. When my friend didn't like the sauce she had gotten with her meal, the waitress took it off her bill. Great customer service and delicious food. Go there!"
1139,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Bigger isn't always better. This place grossed me out and was loud and annoying. My ""basic breakfast"" was pretty good but basic. Service was VERY slow."
1140,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We sat down and were blessed with a great waiter.  This makes a huge difference in your dining experience!  

The BLT Bloody Mary...yum!  While I don't pay the price for drinks in Vegas, this one is worth it.  It's the best Bloody Mary I've had.  The price is tolerable because of it's deliciousness and the glass you get to keep!

It is hard to describe the size of plates and amount of food.  You definitely should/could share anything on the menu.  But if you're like us, we all wanted to try something a little different so we have snacks for tomorrow. 

Overall, we loved it.  The service, unique ""twisted farm food"", tasty sauces, and beautiful presentation have us wanting to eat here again!"
1141,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow what a menu had the flap jacks with brown sugar and bananas they were great. Highly recommend for breakfast.
1142,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great presentation. The chicken & waffles were super moist and tasty. The only bar between getting 5 stars was the price. It's a bit much for a ""breakfast"" food."
1143,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Open 24/7. YUUUUUGEEE portions. Delicious food. What more could you ask for?

Hash House is a chain of some of the best traditional American food I've ever had. This is the stuff that you expect when you combine a gourmet chef with fresh farm ingredients.

The wait times can be a little bit crazy, especially if you come during regular meal hours, or if you don't have any priority pass (i.e. Diamond status) to speed through the line. But it's well worth it if you're hungry -- and it's a great spot for groups too! (Assuming they're okay with waiting.) 

Everything here is great, but if you want to go for what I consider their star dish, then get the fried chicken and waffles. You simply just won't find a grander fried chicken and waffle anywhere. Not only are the portions of the chicken and the waffles MASSIVE, but the waffles have BACON embedded inside of them!! 

Ask for some extra maple syrup and DEFINITELY -- WHATEVER YOU DO, find a friend or TWO to help share this massive dish with! It's gigantic!! But delicious. Feast and enjoy!!

I'm also glad they have free WIFI going throughout the building now, as both the Linq and Hash House can leave you with pretty spotty cellular service (or no service at all). Something about how the building is built and blocks the cellular reception."
1144,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place is the bomb!  The portions are enormous.  Every dish is served with twist.  I recommend sharing but that's not possible because there is so much to chose from you just have to try something different.  Open 24/7 so great choice for a late night snack.  But I always opt for a sweet treat.
1145,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow great service and food. I ordered chicken and waffles my hubby had eggs Benedict. The servings were huge and delicious. We will be back next time in Las Vegas.
1146,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was one of the best meals I had while in Las Vegas, and believe me, I ate a lot! 
This is a southern, down home style of cooking. They're open 24/7, and were able to serve us quickly and efficiently at 4am. 
The food was presented in a beautiful manner, with fresh rosemary and thyme poking out of the food. The food came quickly, and was hot, and there was plenty of it. 
The decor was interesting. Sort of a 70's style steakhouse with all the celebrities who ate there  tacked up by the entrance. 
The service was friendly and efficient. They wished me ""good luck"" when I ordered the house specialty. The prices were a bit higher than what I'm used to paying for down home cooking, but for the portions, it was actually a good deal. I challenge anyone to walk away from this place hungry. It can't happen. I got the dish that was featured on Man vs Food, the fried chicken benedict. I didn't see it as that big of a challenge, but it was a lot of food. My buddy got the hamburger, which he raved about. Our other buddy ordered some sort of chicken dish, but had to leave suddenly when all the free booze from the casinos caught up with him. We attempted to eat his dish, but we couldn't make it. 
The food was filling and delicious, and the fresh herbs were certainly appreciated. 
Out of the entire trip to Vegas, this was probably the culinary highlight of the whole trip. 
It can be a bit difficult to find this place, as it's tucked in the rear of the Linq Casino, but ask enough slot jockeys, and they'll point you in the right direction. 
I encourage you to check this place out."
1147,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy Mackerel! HUGE! lol the portions were HUGE! My husband and I were pretty blown away by how much food we had -- we had food for days! 

It was good though, nonetheless. Definitely a breakfast place you should check out!!"
1148,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ov-er-Ra-ted! *clap clap, clap clap clap*

I don't remember the dish I got the first time I came to Hash House, but I do remember that it had too many different things going on.

This second time around, Adam Richman had coerced me via the wonderful world of television, to visit this place again and divulge in the wonders of the ""fried chicken benedict."" Oh Adam, you deceive me yet again.

It was a very mellow Vegas Sunday morning. We stayed at the LINQ so we had all our bags packed, and went downstairs for our breakfast, around 9am. I mean, it's 9am on a Sunday in Vegas. There couldn't be a wait, could there? Behold, the packs of small parties waiting at the top of the escalator, looking annoyed and hungry. Our wait wasn't too long, perhaps a good 20-25minutes or so? Luckily, we had bags to load up in our car in the hotel parking lot, so we killed time pretty efficiently (go, girls!).

The three ladies and I were seated in a small and cramped circular table, much too small to occupy 4 large (and must I say, very large) dishes. Each one of us ordered a dish; of course, Adam had gotten into my head, so I got the fried chicken benedict. Another friend followed suit, and we also got a steak omelette and smoked salmon hash.

+ Fried Chicken Benedict, famously known as the ""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken"" somethin somethin. Wayyy  too much going on again. The chipotle cream something sauce was too overpowering. My favorite part? The bed of chunky mashed potato at the very bottom of everything. The fried chicken was mediocre, and the biscuits were just wayyy too much.

+ Steam Omelette. One of their weekend specials; probably one of the better dishes of this crowd because of its simplicity.

+ Smoked Salmon Hash. My sister's plate, and to say the very least....she felt like she would've sent it back, if it didn't take so long to get our food already.

All in all, I would much rather go to a different brunch place, for food that is cheaper, and much tastier."
1149,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Expensive! Steak n eggs 16$. Dry, thin little piece of meat. OJ 6.50$ really?
Out of the four of us, two of our orders were wrong  and corrected but both at separate times. $51 for my husband and I for breakfast. Ate at Ellis island the next day 6.99 steak n eggs, delicious!! 
Go go can go."
1150,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Vegan/vegetarian options are very limited. I wish I had more to choose from (especially breakfast/brunch items) than a grilled portabello mushroom sandwich. Although I enjoyed my sandwich with crispy fries, it was super soggy by the time I finished half of it. The portions are very BIG so make sure you come hungry! Prices aren't too bad. Lines get super long on Saturday. You can expect a 45 minute to 1 hour wait around 11am."
1151,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Don't come hangry... expect a wait!

Why?

Because it takes an average person a long, long time to dig through the MASSIVE portions that Hash House serves!

Pro tip: Share with a friend. I eat a lot, but I can't possibly finish a whole order here.

The chicken and waffles is always a winner! Three massive pieces of chicken on top of four waffles stuffed with bacon. Drizzle everything with syrup... Yummy yum yum!

Service was meh. Our server was nonexistent after he took our orders, and the food took forever to come out. All of that contributes to the long wait, and I'm guessing they won't change anything as long as people are willing to line up well out the door to eat here.

Probably the best value on The Strip, given the price, portion, and quality. I hate waiting, but I can definitely see why!"
1152,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I know its gluttonous, but I love it!!  Every trip to Vegas includes a FAT meal at Hash House!  the first time at this location, I found for a Saturday morning the wait was less, I'm sure its because the place is gigantic, and locals aren't going to come to the strip if they can help it."
1153,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I would love to review their food. However, their servers seemed to be actively preventing us from dining at this establishment. After waiting for 15-20 minutes, we noticed the servers leading several girls who had just arrived to a table. When we inquired why the server was letting another party ahead of ours, instead of checking the list, they became increasingly argumentative and verbally combative. Instead of entertaining the idea that we might have been correct in our objections to being bumped down the list by a group of hoochie-looking girls, the servers told us to calm down because ""everyone will eventually get seated."" They eventually agreed to seat us and literally threw the menus at us. When we asked to speak to a manager, they became--again--more aggressive and resentful. The waiter said, in a shockingly sullen tone, ""Yeah, you want the manager? I'll get the manager."" We eventually realized we would neither be served nor see the manager when we saw the server idly chatting to someone around the corner. Not only was he not respecting our request, but he also was not even doing his job with other customers.

This Bruce Lee-looking waiter can suck my ass."
1154,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were warned about the portion sizes but even a stern warning doesn't brace you for the piles of food that is about to be dropped in front of you.  If you're anything less than a binge eater I suggest splitting meals.  

The food is surprisingly good.  Usually portion size is an inverse indicator of food quality but at HH, the food is good!  I had the chicken and biscuits while my friends had a burger (a full pound of beef!) and the other had a breakfast plate with a pancake the size of a car tire.  All of us thought our food was good.

If you're in Vegas, this is certainly a place to check out!"
1155,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Prior to our visit to Vegas I was told about this place and how good their brunch was so it was only right we visited during our stay. We arrived about noon and the line was pretty thick. We checked in with the staff for our party of 11. The wait was about an hour. While waiting, you can order mimosas or Bloody Mary's- mimosas, which were strong but good! 

Once we sat down we were brought a complimentary banana-maple pancake for the table to share. It was huge! Literally the size of the whole plate and yummy. The pancake didn't need any syrup as the syrup tasted infused. For our food we ordered French toast meal. The portions are so big so we split our meal. The French toast came with a fried banana on top, maple syrup and pecans which was served with eggs and bacon, ham or sausage. The food was good, served hot and the service was also very good and attentive. The prices are very reasonable and we will be glad to return.. No complaints.."
1156,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had this after a late night in the casino. Ordered the hash and potatoes. Was pretty decent all things considered.  As far as ""middle of the night"" breakfast goes it hit the spot. But it was definitely wayyyy salty.  Think I had at least 3 glasses of soda to was all the salt down!  Wait staff was attentive and friendly.  No wait to be seated. Good location right across the street from Ceasars and in the middle of the strip."
1157,Hash House A Go Go,5,"WOW....JUST WOW!!! What a hidden treasure this is! I almost want to lie and say it was horrible and keep this little hidden gem a secret!  First time eating at Hash Hash and actually ended up eating there twice. Breakfast and Dinner.  LOVE LOVE LOVE that they are 24/7. There food is off the hook and the portions are HUGE!!! Staff is great! We had the pleasure of getting Kye for both of our visits....she's the best!
I won a gift certificate on FB which was a bonus, but the food speaks for itself! I'd go back without any certificate, it is totally worth it!  So happy to have found a great ""new"" place now to eat at in Vegas!  Oh Yea...don't let the lines discourage you and if you dont want to wait go back later sinces it's 24/7. We ate at 11pm at night and it was just as amazing as the early morning breakfast!"
1158,Hash House A Go Go,4,My first time there and it was pretty good with a WHOLE LOT OF PANCAKE. Good drinks and service and would go back again
1159,Hash House A Go Go,5,My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken and waffles and shared them. You get a huge portion with 4 big waffles stuffed with bacon and topped with their fried chicken. It was the best chicken and waffles I've ever had.
1160,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is a haven of gluttony.  While visiting Vegas for a bachelor party we decided to hit up this hot spot for their famed breakfast.  With every trendy, touristy restaurant there are ups and downs.  

UPs
The Food was great.  Such delicious food and well more than any one person should ever eat.  

Nice environment, everyone there seemed really friendly and helpful

Down's
They told us 45 minute wait which turned into a two hour wait.  Luckily we were at a casino and had ample time to lose our money,

The bloody mary which i was super excited for was a little more bells and whistles and lacked some quality.  It looked amazing with its bacon and slice of toast, however upon drinking it there was nothing that made it special beyond the decor of the glass."
1161,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was asked about 1/2 portions... yea, the waiter aid they could work with the patron. I saw several tables sharing different orders.... hope this helps.

BTW this place was great. Great food, great service. And reasonably priced."
1162,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great late night comfort food. Great portion size, would definitely recommend sharing."
1163,Hash House A Go Go,5,Go for breakfast and make sure you have time to wait for a table. Very busy place. We enjoyed the corn beef hash snd my husband loved the biscuits.
1164,Hash House A Go Go,2,Eggs were undercooked and so was sausage.  Not worth the time and cab ride to get there from mgm
1165,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A LOT OF FOOD!!! If you are starving and want a lot of food worth your buck, come to this place. Anything you order will be a giant serving! Prepare for a wait though. This place is very popular."
1166,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ate here several times on the trip.  Not sure if the off-strip location is better, but who cares because this one was delicious.  Portions are huge, it's not expensive, and it's like this little oasis inside of the rusty sinking Titanic of the Imperial Palace.

I've been back for a week and I already miss the food."
1167,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We have always tried to eat here whenever we go to Vegas but it was always packed. We finally had a chance to eat here today. Wait was not that bad, we waited for a out 10mins.

We tried the Andy's sage chicken and the corned beef hash on their brunch menu. Both were pretty good. The chicken was juicy and not dry. The servings were definitely huge and filling. The plates are good for sharing. Service was just okay, nothing special.

Bottom line: food presentation and taste was good but its not something I will be craving in the future."
1168,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had to visit this place after seeing it on Man vs. Food.

Portions, as already stated by every yelp review on this place, are GIGANTIC!  Each entree must be at least 5,000 calories and 10 pounds, but hey....when you're in Vegas, who's counting?!?

Ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  The deeper I dug into it, the more surprises I found.  Fried Chicken....then eggs....then spinach.... then tomatoes....then biscuits....then mashed potatoes....then waffles, all swimming in gravy.  SO GOOD.  I almost devoured my entire plate...and I'm a little girl.  Everyone was impressed!  Gluttony at its best. =)"
1169,Hash House A Go Go,3,Portions are huge as described.. That may be the only reason they got 3 stars to be honest.  If your gonna be hungry 2-3 hours from when you actually plan on eating.. This is your place!  We showed up on Sunday around 12:30.. Put our name on the list. We were told it would be about an hour.  headed to the bar for a pre brunch cocktail and waited another 15 minutes to be served even there.  Finally got our drinks and retreated back to the waiting area with the other 200+ people waiting for a table.  Wasn't until an hour and 15 minutes had passed that we asked about our name and instantly we were called over microphone system.  Ordered and 55 minutes later finally the food showed up.  The portions were huge as advertised.. The customer service was pretty inadequate for the amount of time we waited.  All and all.. It was sufficient.  But not overly impressive.  Next time we'll spend a few more bucks and get a little less food in 1/10th the amount of time.  Maybe take the bus up the street to the pepper mill.  Plus the Linq is by far not my favorite casino.  So many options in Vegas.  Hard to believe I'll make it back to this location of hash house a go go.  If anything solely because the beer list at the first bar near the entrance is far superior to most everything else you find in Vegas and relatively cheap for the strip as well. Other than that.. I'll stay away.  You can decide for yourself!
1170,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The worse Hash House we have ever been to. 5 of us ordered food and none of us liked any of it. Sweet sauce was drizzled all over the plate like the chef was watching too many episodes of chopped. All our food was super sweet and none of it was supposed to be. We ordered the pork and were told by ""Kevin the manager"" that it was their bbq cream sauce. He also was personally insulted that we didn't like this sweet sauce that tasted exactly like teriyaki sauce. Our waitress tried to get him to take some off our bill but he refused which was fine because I paid with a gift card and had no intentions on ever going back. Service was awesome but he was a rude jerk and takes the food way too personal. We paid and I gave the rest of my remaining gift card to another table. It sucks because this was my brother's birthday meal and Kevin and his sweet sauce ruined it."
1171,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash house was our first stop when we got to Vegas. We were looking for a place to grab a quick bite and a couple of drinks. 

There was 8 of us and we all fit easily at the bar. The bartender was great. Got our drinks right away and our food came out quickly as well. 

Happy Hour specials seemed very reasonable. I believe Miller Lites were $3 and the chicken tender appetizers was $5. I was pleasantly surprised when they came with fries as well.

The foods isn't going to knock your socks off, but it was exactly what we were expecting."
1172,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time! Finally gave it a try....... 
I wish i could remember our servers name because her customer service was great! We started off with ordering a Nitro cold brew.. when we did she asked us if we wanted some Jameson with & we couldn't say no... we were in Vegas after all. 
We looked at the menu for 30 min because everything sounded amazing! So hard to pick a dish!!! Lol 
We finally decided on our dish....... now i'm not a meatloaf person but i got the meatloaf hash & added jalapeÃ±os... BEST IDEA EVER! My man ordered the chicken & waffles.. HUGE AND DELICIOUS! 
If you come here & get a biscuit do yourself a favor
& get a side of gravy to go with it... you will not regret it!  
We had leftover food of course! 
Overall... amazing service & food.
No complaints at all"
1173,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was a great experience. We did wait 45 minutes for a table, but the gal told us that it would be a 45 minute wait and it was EXACTLY that amount of time. The lobby area was very crowded and there was no place to sit while waiting. That was the only not so great part. Otherwise, the food was so good, portions were gargantuan. I got a flapjack, eggs and potatoes. My boyfriend got the famous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. Everything was delicious and our waitress Heather did a superb job. I would, hands down, come back here during a subsequent visit to Vegas."
1174,Hash House A Go Go,4,Solid... Everything in Vegas is plastic... This one was a surprise... Much better than average strip food.
1175,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This past weekend in Vegas, I was blessed to FINALLY be able to try Hash House A Go GO, Las Vegas, NV, a top bookmarked restaurant of mine for years!! Out of all the locations, I heard that the one in Vegas is the best!!!! This place is famous for Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, but most importantly, it is a MAN VS FOOD FAVORITE!!! How many of you guys watch the Travel Channel and love the Man Vs. Food TV Show??!!!! If you do, do you know about this place?! Hash House gets so many visits from foodists in this TV Show! Adam Richman himself marks their famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict as a Man Vs. Food favorite!!!! There's even a picture of him holding the plate!  Look for it in their picture gallery 

spiked kiwi watermelon lemonade - This was absolutely delicious! Whoever would have thought that watermelon would go well with alcohol or even do a good job masking the taste! I got a pretty good buzz going on and didn't taste anything! Absolutely refreshing in this summer heat!

hashed house quesadilla stuffed with mashed potatoes, jalapenos, eggs, and tomato with chili cream - Deliciously creamy and soft to eat due to their red skin mashed potatoes! The tortilla was perfectly crispy!! It was so big!!! I loved the sprinkled peppers on top! Gave it a mexi-kick! And those skinny, brown sticks in front? I don't know what it was but it was sure crunchy and fun to eat! 

ANDY'S SAGE FRIED CHICKEN with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs MAN VS. FOOD FAVORITE! Served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes

Pros: 
-huge portions on everything and still good quality!
-Always gonna have takeout for an entire another meal! 
-delicious mixed drinks 
-great place for friends and large groups 

Cons: 
-long wait but worth the wait! 
-slow service (cause they're so busy)"
1176,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Whether you come here for brunch or late night drunchies, Hash House is sure to leave you stuffed! During Vegas' busy seasons, you might find yourself waiting 30+ mins to get a table depending on how big your party is. But trust me, it's worth it! 

Their hashes are delicious & come in huge portions! I always get the fresh mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash. The potatoes come diced and crispy seasoned to perfection. The biscuit that comes along with it is whatever's to me, I'm all about the potatoes + eggs. The eggs come scrambled and almost have a buttery flavor to me. They aren't as seasoned as the potatoes but I like that I can add salt + pepper to my liking. 

All the food here is hearty and big portioned so it's a great place to eat to prepare for all that drinking. 
If you do visit, be sure to try their Bloody Mary! It's one of my favorites in Vegas, comparable to the one served at Guy Fieri's. It's not too spicy to enjoy but has just the right amount of kick to it. 

Prices are what you would expect to pay in Vegas, so $$$ but considering you'll most likely leave with leftovers, it's like purchasing two meals for the price of one. Service here is always great!"
1177,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food here is huge. If you're at all on a diet, medical or otherwise, don't eat here. I had a very hard time finding something that was reasonable, everyday food, even when split amongst multiple people. If I remember correctly, I saw one vegetarian thing on the whole menu. 

The food is good tasting, but I wish it came in half or even quarter-sized portions."
1178,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Perfect sobering-up food! 

HHAGG is located inside of Quad hotel. According to our very friendly waiter, they offer food from 5 different menus. We got here around 10pm so the menu they offered had a handful of burgers and sandwiches, sage fried chicken and waffles, and a few breakfast items. 

Portions are gargantuous! Easily shared by two very hungry adults! 

We ordered & shared the Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict, which comes with layers of ooey-gooey goodness! The infamous Sage-Fried Chicken, fresh spinach, scrambled eggs, hardwood smoked bacon, tomatoes, and grilled mozzarella are served on a bed of grilled mashed potatoes and fresh split biscuit, ....and if that isn't enough, they top it with their homemade chipotle cream sauce!!  Sounds weird I know, but it's like nothing you've ever tasted before, in a good way! 

Give it a go-go! ;)"
1179,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The waffles have bacon in them.

Did you read that? THE WAFFLES. HAVE. BACON IN THEM. What the crap?!

This place was so very delicious and absolutely worth the wait. A must try at least ONCE whenever you got Vegas. The portions are huge and that is an understatement. I would recommend sharing a meal with a friend.

I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedicts and a friend got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles...heaven."
1180,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Can pass on this place.  The prices are outrageous!  Food is adequate. Have eaten in 2 of the locations and one is no better than the other.  Don't waist your time, money and diet.  There are so many other places to eat and not have to ""settle"" for what is served."
1181,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was amazing! Service was excellent! The portions are huge and the drinks are good! Couldn't be more happier!
1182,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We were searching for a good breakfast and we hit jackpot! Huge portions, fresh food, clean, and inexpensive compared to many other places in the strip. Major thumbs up and eager to return."
1183,Hash House A Go Go,5,Lots of food! We order a hash and split it. Service is great too! Next time will try one of the Bloody Marys.
1184,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best place for breakfast on the Strip... newer clean place, huge portions, great price for the quality, and very attentive staff.

The line to get in can be pretty crazy, but if you have the time to wait, this is the place... you can't beat $8.95 for a simple breakfast platter that's big enough to feed Paul Bunyan!"
1185,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The biscuits, the Bloody Mary... all of it!  Amazing!  And we had the awesome treat of having Taylor as our waitress.  I knew I could expect the food to be great, but it was a pleasant surprise to find that the service was wonderful as well!"
1186,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait time was decent & the servers/staff are friendly ! Jesus could've def came here when he fed the Multitude lol. Ordered chicken & waffles & it was a huge serving! I'm a glutton & I still couldn't finish it all! 
The food was delish! Bacon bits in between the waffles def topped it off for my taste buds. The fried chicken was perfection! 
Libation of choice : Tangerine Mimosa !"
1187,Hash House A Go Go,2,"i ordered the sage fried chicken eggs benedict. the server said it was one of the most popular dishes and according to the menu, it was featured on man vs. food. no joke this thing is effing monstrous. when i saw it i was like this is is a bunch of stuff in one disgusting pile and when i took a bite, i was even more disappointed. the chicken was dry and not that flavorful, the biscuit was super dense, the eggs were scrambled which means it is NOT a benedict. and there were random strips of bacon somewhere in the middle of all that crap. so really, its a heap of random fatty food. i also split the chorizo hash with my boy. this was better but still not that great. really really salty and unimpressive. the best part of my meal was my cinnamon coffee. but that cost $6 which is half the cost of my dish so it better have been good!"
1188,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Meal portions are HUGE!! We could not even share one meal!! The bathrooms are too far away to try eating one meal by yourself! Those chicken and waffles. DAMN!!  Food is great. Loved the fried pork tenderloin as well, and have enjoyed the chicken fried steak before. Beers here priced around $5, so not bad for strip standards. Prices a bit high , unless you share! We will never not share here and so therefore the prices are great!!! Expect to wait here to be seated but it honestly goes fast! Only reason I do not have this a five yet is the fact our service was a bit off. Slow to get to us, slow getting refills, etc. Nice as hell guy, but needs pick it up a bit. Can not wait to come here again!! PS: That hash!! ummmmmuummmmmumm."
1189,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was going to give it a 1 star but the food tasted a lot better when it was cold and I was hammered. Moral of the story, increase your satisfaction by drinking a lot before eating here."
1190,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came here for breakfast while in town on vacation.  I've been to the Chicago one and left with mixed feelings.  This location was out of this world!  The hash was amazing and the presentation of all the dishes I saw around the restaurant were fantastic!
1191,Hash House A Go Go,2,horrible service and food was inedible.... felt like cattle and could care less that we only took one bite... never again
1192,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Long line, but still got seated super fast. The portions are HUGE and the food delicious! Nathan was super helpful in answering my friend's questions about gluten free options (there aren't a ton, but you can't go wrong with bacon and eggs and their yummy crispy potatoes). Second time there and would definitely go there for a third!"
1193,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent food and attentive staff. Large portions so sharing should be considered. Definitely a great spot to get breakfast in Vegas.
1194,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We stopped in here last night as we were out on the town and had a fabulous time.  Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive.  Food was amazing. I had the bacon cheeseburger, which is freaking huge! And delicious. Massive burger (two patties - the thing was the size of my head), nice buttery bun, fresh veggies and pickles, gooey melted cheese and delicious bacon. Just amazing. The wife had the chicken and waffles. These were also amazing. Crispy waffles with delicious syrup and huge, succulent, juicy fried chicken breasts. Absolutely delicious. 

We will definitely be back here, and its easily one of (if not the) best thing at the quad. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area!"
1195,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome as always. Big ass pancakes, can't go wrong. I usually get the Chorizo hash. Massive portion and delicious. Always a must go when I am in LV!"
1196,Hash House A Go Go,2,Had the chicken and waffles it was definitely over rated. The customer service was excellent but the food is all hype. Sorry.
1197,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food for brunch is good. I had the chicken with eggs and bacon. It was different and very good. Huge portion, absolutely huge. Service was great, solid place to try once for brunch or lunch"
1198,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wish we stumbled upon this brunch place sooner! Amazing food, unique take on the classic Benedict and omelette. Fair warning, and I wish someone had told us earlier, portion sizes are huge! Any Benedict you order will feed a party of 3."
1199,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food! Good service.

My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken and waffles and the basic breakfast to share. It was more food than we could eat, we probably could of fed one or two more people easily. The fried chicken was great. My boyfriend got a piece of bacon in his waffle but I didn't find any other waffle pieces with bacon, unfortunately. It was still good though. Wish I would have tried one of the eggs benedicts, they were huge and looked delicious."
1200,Hash House A Go Go,5,Go here if you are starving or just love an great home cooked style meal. Glad we made time to go. Great prices and for 20 dollars you can have a great meal big enough to share. We had chicken and waffles which was amazing the waffle batter rocks as does fried chicken. Also we had the tasty Indiana pork which was huge and flavorful. Drinks are big and good make sure you have room for the free biscuits and strawberry jam. I wish we had one closer to nj!
1201,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Really large portions, but the food is just average. The fried chicken was not especially seasoned, and it was mostly dry breast. The waffles are stuffed with bacon, but better in theory than in taste."
1202,Hash House A Go Go,4,Wait was long but I expected it would be since it's always packed. Takes a long time to get food but they make it from scratch. Chicken and waffles were good.
1203,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place has quickly morphed into a ""must do"" bucket list kind of thing!  I hit this joint every single Vegas trip. It will fulfill all your food fantasies, PG or XXX.  Fun for the whole family. Be careful you will over order by about 5 families.  The meatloaf hash is one of my faves.  I always start with the wagon wheel sized soft pretzel that comes hanging on a rack with a couple dipping sauces.  Service has always been spot on and attentive and full of suggestions.You will not be disappointed."
1204,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Redic portions but worth the experience. Pop a Prilosec and enjoy. Had the 13"" choc chip pancake and the BF tried their famous man vs food sage biscuit which was huge (an understatement). All in all- really really big and average on flavor."
1205,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House's food was fresh, tasty, and everything had a good twist on traditional ""home cooked"" food. Not to mention, the service was spectacular on both visits. 

Our group of 10 dined at Hash House twice for breakfast while in Vegas over Christmas. Staying at the Flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the Imperial Palace and up the escalator dedicated to Hash House. Getting to the restaurant before 9AM both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. The restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10AM. Our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. For me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. 

While the food was VERY good, being The Griddle cafe fanatic that I am, I cannot give Hash House 5 stars. Their pancakes (snickers) and french toast did not compare to the deliciousness that is The Griddle. 

BUT, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is note worthy. Perfectly Fried Chicken breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best fried chicken I recall having (although I rarely eat fried chicken). The waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. This was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. The maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and I recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. 
It was just YUM! My boyfriend and I split the dish and it was perfect for two people. The next visit we split the french toast which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. The banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. It went well with the french toast. 

Many people at our table went with the Tractor Special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. No one tried their hash, sadly. 

Any meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, DO IT! Our server was nice enough not to charge to $2.50 split plate charge. 

I do think that Hash House is a ""Must-Go"" while in Vegas. But, sorry, HH, you're not The BEST. xoxo"
1206,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Finally ate here for the first time last week and I definitely found my new favorite place to eat in Vegas! Hash House is a very busy place and the wait is long, but the breakfast is worth it. My sis and I shared a blueberry pancake (which is bigger than the plate it comes on!) and the avocado, bacon, Swiss scramble with fruit, crispy potatoes and a homemade biscuit. Everything was amazing! Everything was fresh and cooked just right; the biscuit being soft and flaky and the pancake wasn't too much. Definitely share plates as the portions are huge and reservations are best due to the over an hour wait. We stopped in to see the menu the night before and they have decent happy hour too with well drinks at $3, which in Vegas is an amazing price. This place is a must for foodies!"
1207,Hash House A Go Go,3,Good but not spectacular. Portions are huge. Husband had chicken and waffle which had bacon throughout which he enjoyed. Waffle was too dry. Chicken was over battered. Burger was tasty! Good meat to bun ratio.
1208,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food! Awesome mimosa! Had the salmon scramble, the best! My husband had Bloody Mary-top notch and chicken fried steak, he said one of the best he's had."
1209,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hash House is located up a set of escalators in the Quad. There are a lot of meat options and the portions are quite generous, but in terms of food quality and price, a place like Denny's is a much better deal.

The all blue crab cake with angel hair pasta and basil pesto ($11 appetizer) was basically a huge pan fried crab cake on top of a pile of pasta about the same size as the crab cake. The Boston Hash ($15) had an identical all blue crab cake, with crispy potatoes and two eggs. The potato hash was quite good, but both crab cakes were barely warm - two sides were slightly brown, but the inside of one crab cake was actually cool, as if it hadn't been defrosted before they'd thrown it in the pan. The sunny-side-up eggs were also quite sad. Gordon Ramsey might describe one of them as ""so raw it's about to fly away.""

I also tried two sandwiches. The grilled portobello mushroom sandwich ($13) was okay, except for the soggy bun and the barely-there goat cheese. The meat in the crispy pork tenderloin sandwich ($14) was very large but very thin; as a result, the pork was very dry and half of the meat was crispy batter. Also, since the meat had such large diameter, you couldn't actually eat it like a sandwich - you had to first eat only the meat and work your way toward the part actually covered by the bun and condiments. But by the time you reach the bun part, you won't even feel like eating any more. It'd be better if the meat was thicker with a smaller diameter, so it didn't dry out while deep-frying.

Overall, nothing was really satisfying, especially after we saw the bill... Th server was great, really friendly, but that couldn't redeem the pitiful meal."
1210,Hash House A Go Go,5,Sage Chicken! Get it! So delicious and HUGE - I highly recommend sharing that with someone. Amazing place with a great staff. Their Bloody Caesars are very good as well.
1211,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We walked up and there was a long wait, but put our name in anyways and boy did it go quick. This place really knows how to accommodate a lot of people and quickly. We got chicken and waffleS and holy moly they were so good. The portion is enough for 2-3 people to split. Our friend got the farmer something and the French toast was pretty delicious. I would def go back."
1212,Hash House A Go Go,1,"If you ain't black,, get back.

We had a horrible experience here last visit.
Black employees would seat black guests, while white and Asians and Hispanics could wait for a seat at the back of the bus.

Black customers offered booths,, other non-black customers refused booths and were only allowed tables in the middle of the dining room.

Complaints to the manager fell on deaf ears. He grabbed his car keys and left the scene.

Black employees brutally rude and ignoring to non-black customers.
Friendly and helpful to black customers.

We're regulars here spend freely and we tip very well, and this place ain't cheap.

Reverse discrimination at it's lowest.
We won't be back."
1213,Hash House A Go Go,5,This breakfast made me want to stay at the linq next time! I had the sage fried chicken and waffles and it was fabulous. The leftovers on the bench in front of Caesars were even better ;)
1214,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ordered Sage Chicken & Waffles, Corned Beef Hash, and Tenderloin.
Serving size is huge and the food presentation is nice."
1215,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Go Go to Hash Hash inside The LINQ hotel (was the Imperial Palace, then the Quad).  I honestly did not see any reviews before we went, I just loved the name.   Holy cow, you better be ready for some serious breakfast when you get there.

The pancakes are larger than the plate they are served on.  My guess is they are equivalent to 6 normal pancakes with the thickness of them.  They are AMAZINGLY good which is somewhat surprising given the size of them.  I just sampled a friend's pancake but did not order one.

I went with the smoked bacon, avocado, onion scrambler with the crispy potatoes and biscuit.  I was a bit surprised because it was served in a plate, I was expecting a cast iron skillet like my friend received with his scrambler.  But no matter, it was just so incredibly good.  Potatoes were perfect and the sprig of rosemary in the biscuit added  a nice touch of flavor.   Coffee was excellent as well.

I'm so glad we wandered over to Hash Hash from the Flamingo hotel as it was a far superior breakfast to anything served in the hotel.    It's well worth up to a 30 minute wait if necessary.  Probably the best breakfast I've ever had in a restaurant."
1216,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is my first time here and the food is amazing!!! I ordered the filet ribeye with polenta... Omg I just about died when I took the first bite! I can't wait to come in the morning for breakfast and try the egg Benedict plate which was featured on man vs food... Ahhhh I'm excited!!
1217,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always a delight. Portions are generous, prices are great, and food is delicious. Required Vegas eats."
1218,Hash House A Go Go,5,"WOW!! Share SHarE SHARE!! Large portions and SO DELICIOUS. The kids' pancakes are the size of the adult size and you can get the same flavors. Park at the LINQ parking lot, then go to level G in the elevator, follow signs to Restaurants. The wait time can be long so either make a reservation 2pm or later or go to the Sahara location for earlier. But walk in times can sometimes work out too. We arrived at 11am and got in right away with a party of 5 on a Thursday.

We got the brown sugar banana pancake and the chocolate chip pancake for the 2 kids with sausage and eggs. Then the 3 adults shared them too. Plus we got the safe chicken Benedict and shared that. The chipotle cream sauce was fantastic!! Potatoes fantastic! Biscuit yummy!!! Chicken - outrageously good.

The service started out rough over the phone with a fairly rude hostess, but our server was fabulous and the manager was incredibly friendly and so proud of his restaurant. He loves his job. 

Definitely go! Definitely share or plan to take home leftovers."
1219,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You better have an appetite for some heavy, rib sticking, cooking!! My wife was told about this spot from one of her clients and I am sure glad we tipped off! Very different having mashed potatoes with my breakfast, buy hey, no complaintshere. I helped my wife with her pancake too. OJ was fresh and refreshing. Coffee was great too. This was a true breakfast experience of ""uniqueness!"""
1220,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Unless you like the themed tourist trap type of restaurant, definitely avoid. 

Fellow Yelpers, I feel slightly betrayed. Normally you are so on target, but this is a place that does not at all stand up to the hype. 

This place is at the back of The Linq, formerly Imperial Palace, and the reviews had me wanting to check it out. I knew something was off however as soon as I got to the escalator and there were 60 or so people waiting to get a table. We spoke with the hostess and were informed of a 1.25 hour wait. 

We were hungry, but not one to shy away from adversity, we stuck it out. After 32 min we were called and shown to a booth. That was the last time I can call something a positive. The booth itself was oversized. I am a 6' male with a tall torso, and the table top was just below the center of my chest. This made for a very uncomfortable meal as I had to lean up and forward just to get to the table. 

Any benefit we had from getting the table faster evaporated while waiting for our server. That was another 15 min. I ordered a flapjack with eggs and bacon and my wife ordered a chorizo hash. When the food came, it was ""ok.""  Certainly not bad, but just ok. The portions were massive. No way a single person could finish unless they were in some competition with themselves or others. 
We finished up and got out as soon as we could due to realizing that the cigarette smoke from the casino pretty much drafts up throughout the entire restaurant. 
This place may be good for hangover food. The portions are massive, but it is really nothing special about it. You can get the same food experience at Denny's on the Strip and not pay a premium for being in a theme. 
If you choose to dine here. Good luck. Oh... And make sure you are hydrated, it was quite warm in the restaurant."
1221,Hash House A Go Go,2,"To be honest I don't know what the hype is all about for this place. I tried Hash House for the first time years ago and my 2nd/last visit reminded me why I decided to never come back.

On weekends there is a wait. I mean it would be worth the wait if I actually enjoyed the food.

I ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles and my niece ordered the snickers pancakes combo. Neither were ""WOW"" or ""OMG so good."" They were just ok and I feel like I could have gotten better and cheaper somewhere else. Won't be returning."
1222,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I cannot say how impressed I was with this place.  First of all there was no wait which was already a good sign (or because it was 9am and most of the folks that went out the night before just went to bed an hour before that)...we get seated and about 3 minutes later, our server greets us.  Nicest guy ever.  Customer service is huge for me.  My cousin told him it was my birthday and he told me happy birthday and offered me a complimentary shot of whatever I wanted.  I'm sold! I ordered the chicken and waffles and OH.EM.GEE!  BOMBdotcom...I didn't even feel guilty about all of the calories because 1. it was my birthday 2. who the hell cares when it comes to chicken and waffles and 3. ITS VEGAS #turnup.  I will definitely be coming back to this place on a regular when I go back to Vegas.  Forget the buffets, this is really all I need and its way cheaper.  We went to Ceasar's before this and the buffet was $50 (but then again, it was Thanksgiving weekend).  Thank you for the excellent service.  I hope you guys keep this type of customer service consistant but I have a good feeling about it."
1223,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was awesome! However i cant say much about the service.  We had a party of 12 and we werent all there at once so we werent seated until our whole party was there...once we were all there we had to wait for a table 5 minutes plus but then there was only a few customers inside...we were finally seated and half of us wanted the brunch and the other half wanted dinner but then the waiter told us that we could not order dinner until 5 which at that time was about 4:45pm...so the other half waited til 5! I have to say the Fried CHicken Benedict was hands down the best! I will be back to hash house however will not be going to this location.
1224,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After a few recommendations from friends we ended up at the Linq to eat the sizable meal at Hash House A Go Go for breakfast.

There was little to no wait time and walking by the numerous tables you can see how generous the portion sizes are. 

We shared the chicken and waffles, with bacon in the waffle.  Firstly, no joke on portion size. 1 entree can feed 2-3 adults or  4-5 kids.  My SO also ordered their this delicious blueberry cocktail, which surprisingly didn't taste like alcohol (super bonus for me!) .  
        The bacon that was embedded in the waffle was super smoky, that reminded me of camping. The fried chicken was good, with hints of rosemary and pepper. But my favourite part was was the fried strands of green onions. Overall, it was a delicious mess which practically left us in a food coma.

Definitely try it out with a bunch of your friends and family. Their menu is extensive and you'll most likely have to go back multiple times to try it all out or being home a doggy bag."
1225,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here with a group of us for work based on a recommendation from another co-worker.  We were not disappointed!  Portion sizes were MASSIVE!  Presentation was great!  Taste was on par!  The prices were really great too...which was a welcome surprise on the Vegas Strip!  We got a tower of Fried Green Tomatoes to share - it was presented over a watermelon in a way I'd never seen before, and obviously fabulous.  The server brought us some biscuits and honey which were warm, fresh and delicious.  I got a burger and it was great.  One of our party got the Fried Chicken - everybody around us ordered it as well, he said it was wonderful.  

Everybody left happy, full and with leftovers.  If you're looking for a hearty meal on the cheap definitely come here!"
1226,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I heard a lot of good things about this place so I thought I'd give it a try. Went about a week ago with one of my gfs and we loved it!!! I wanted to try the fried chicken and waffles and she wanted an eggs benedict dish so our waiter suggested we share Andy's sage fried chicken benedict and get a bacon waffle on the side..and let me tell you it was delicious, filling, and HUGE!! We couldn't even finish it between the two of us...def glad we went and I will be going back!!"
1227,Hash House A Go Go,4,Busy business! A lot of food for what you pay for. Great service for a busy joint. Went to try the infamous chicken and waffles. Not my favorite dish. Had nothing to do with hash hash.
1228,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food is good, served with right attitude and ingredients. Careful about how much you order, the portions are extra large. It's usually 5 mins wait to get seated."
1229,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First time here and loved it! Kye the bartender was great! She made great recommendations, and it was spot on ! 
Not really a meatloaf fan, but the Stuffed Meatloaf was amazing! The Bacon appetizer was to die for !"
1230,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is amazing. Best breakfast I've ever had. The food is beyond good. Delicious! The service was great. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. Went over the menu with our large party and answered everyone's questions. He even explained that they don't use heat lamps and that everyone 's food would arrive at different times as it came fresh out of the kitchen. The portions were enormous - but we were all fairly warned. The price was more than fair for the amount of food you get and everything was just incredible. What a treat!
1231,Hash House A Go Go,2,"It seemed like everybody who's ever been to vegas has tried this except for me. And now I finally have! Am I cool now? I actually didn't like it all, but at least I can check it off my list now. Main reason: waffles were soggy. And there was bacon in it..that I did not know. I love bacon but I'm not one of those who think bacon tastes good with everything. Chocolate does. Really though, I would've preferred it on the side or not at all. The waffle batter made the bacon soft and old tasting and I like my bacon crunchy. The chicken was yummy tastin though."
1232,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Highly rexommend. It is worth the wait. Try the chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, machaca, it's all amazing."
1233,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Great presentation and service. Overall a fun location. I'm sad to say that the hammered pork sandwich was very bland. Not bad, just flavorless. How something that looks so amazing/intimidating can taste like nothing is beyond me, but the only distinct flavors were the pickles and ketchup. I guess that's what I get for ordering something with ""Indiana"" in the name! Prices are right and I did have a good time. I would consider going back for some late night short-order breakfast."
1234,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I'm obviously not a food critic by far, but I will like to share my experience at Hash A Go Go this morning. The Salmon Hash is probably the most disgusting meal on the menu. I don't understand why it's on the menu. I'm sure someone can acquire a taste for it, but trust me when I say it looks and taste awful !"
1235,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Truthfully, this is the only good thing about the Imperial Palace hotel which, itself, is a true shit hole.  Hold your nose and close your eyes as you walk thru IP and take the escalator up to get the HHAGG.  If you can handle THAT, you're home free cuz this is a great spot for breakfast. First off, be aware how ridiculously enormous the portions are.  Split a meal with at least one person, hell, maybe even two!  One pancake is bigger than a huge dinner plate and honestly deserving to be called a ""flap jack"". The chicken and waffles is a tower enough to feed three people on a regular day - I mean two huge chicken breasts and 3-4 thick-ass waffles. Large sized juices are seriously LARGE sized - close to a quart? Fun atmosphere and reasonable prices considering how much you are served.  We'll definitely be back!"
1236,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Honestly I have always been the person that was never impressed by breakfast restaurants because I always thought, ""Its just breakfast, there's not much you can do with it.""  Well Hash House a Go Go, has firmly changed my opinion on the matter. I was blown away at the serving sizes and quality of food. When you go, make sure you go to share an order or you will definitely be leaving with leftovers. My friend and I ordered the chicken and waffle tower, that's right I said tower! and it was amazing. Also make sure to order a side of a biscuit and try their home-made jam, its delicious. An easy 5 out of 5 stars. Also service was great, forgot the name of our server but he as well did an amazing job."
1237,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food. Huge portions, definitely enough to share. Excellent bloody Mary's. Excellent service. Would definitely be back."
1238,Hash House A Go Go,5,Portions are ginormous! The food is delicious and is reasonable priced as far as Vegas goes
1239,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here twice during our recent trip to Vegas.  We ate once for breakfast and once for lunch - FYI the menus change for each.   Portions are HUGE, Food was great., Wait wasn't long.  Customer service the first time we went (breakfast around 11am) sucked.  The place wasn't that busy - maybe 5 other tables and 4 other waiters/waitresses but our waiter took forever to even stop by to introduce himself.  Drinks took awhile to get to us as did the food after we ordered.  Worst part about it was who I'm assuming was the manager had the staff that was just literally standing around clean the booths and not just touch ups but actually removing the seats and cleaning under.  This would be great if they didn't have to do it at the booths all around our table.  Call me crazy but dust and dirt and old food particles flying in the air as I'm eating isn't that appealing to me!  Luckily the food was awesome and I was starving so I was able to eat fast.  The second time we went our waiter was on point.  Nice younger guy who greeted us promptly,  offered to go over the menu with us, and even made recommendations - which didn't disappoint.  The hostess this time was quite rude though.  She had seated our table one seat short so we grabbed a chair from the empty table behind us.  Well this didn't float with her as when she came back around she told us that she needed that chair and that we needed to grab one from another table, one w/ opened slats on the back.  Umm ok why?! ?! And why not be a little nicer when  you say this to paying customers?!  Luckily again our waiter saved the day and made light of the situation w/ a joke about matching chairs.  Again the food was great so all in all we left happy.  I rate this place 5 stars on the food and 3 stars on the customer service (all thanks to our second experience w/ the waiter) so I averaged it out at 4 stars."
1240,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Please go here, it's to die for. And please listen to all the reviews that say to split a meal but it's literally impossible to finish one on your own (and it's a bit pricey). Don't bother with the drinks because they weren't good and only took up room in my stomach where more food could have been. They give you these warm biscuits with this honey sauce over the top and I could literally just eat this forever. It's like nothing I've ever had before and it's simply heaven. We split the meatloaf meal which was also great, but even splitting it, we couldn't finish it... that's how big the portions are!! The waiter didn't seem thrilled we were splitting a meal but stick to what the reviews say and what I'm saying..... SPLIT A MEAL. I overhead a couple who didn't and they told the waiter they wished they had. This is a place I will definitely be back (we almost even went back the following night.. that's how much we loved it!!)"
1241,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go is a must visit breakfast restaurant on the Las Vegas strip.  Tucked back into the Linq Casino, Hash House is always jam packed and crazy popular.  And it is deservingly so as it is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants in the country.

So you enter the Linq Casino and head towards the back.  You should see some signage and some escalators going up to the second level.  This is Hash House.  It has a truck stop/farm kind of decor.  Stainless steel tables, wooden trim, and more stainless steel.  Very rustic and well done.

The food at Hash House is amazing.  Their novelty would be large portions of food.  Not comically large portions but big enough as to where even heavy duty eaters are taking a decent amount of food to go.  I go to Las Vegas often and I always try to eat at Hash House at least once while in town.  I have had most items on the menu, but my favorite would be the sage fried chicken and waffles. 

The sage fried chicken and waffles.  Two giant pieces of fried chicken breast pinned to a stack of bacon waffles with a large serrated knife.  A giant sprig of sage. A scattering of fried leeks.  A side of maple syrup.  This dish is amazing.  The waffles have the bacon cooked into them.  The chicken is seasoned and cooked perfectly; juicy with the flavor sealed in.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this dish.

Hash House always has a fun drink menu.  They have the crazy BLT bloody mary with the bacon in it.  My go to is the 25 ounce Budweiser in a bag.  It's Vegas.  I was probably up all night drinking.  I can have a tall boy Budweiser with breakfast if I want to. 

Altogether, Hash House is a must eat if you happened to be in Vegas.  Sure, the lines are going to be killer most of the time, but fortunately they are open 24/7 so you can improvise.  Sage fried chicken and waffles.  Do it."
1242,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was conveniently located in the Linq where we were staying, so we ended up going for breakfast. Food was delicious, service was fast. I would definitely go back again. We went early around 8AM so there was no wait but we did see the line was getting long as we were leaving. 5 stars!"
1243,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing breakfast! 
Went in for a very late breakfast on a Wednesday about 2pm. I ordered the French toast. My husband ordered the eggs, bacon and a pancake the size of a hubcap. My French toast was amazing. Pecan nuts and banana. To die for. Best French toast I've ever had. We got seated right away and our sever was very friendly. We never had empty glasses. Next time I visit vegas I will definitely get the French toast again."
1244,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The first thing the server asked when we sat down was, ""Have you guys been here and have you guys heard about our portion?""  LOL.  And it's true, the portion is HUGE.  We went there for breakfast and walked out stuffed.  I had their famous fried chicken eggs benedict while my husband tried their corn beef hash.  Our friends had meatloaf hash and french toast.  Everything was over the top, huge, and delicious."
1245,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great Service.  Being that this restaurant is in Las Vegas, they really do a great job getting you seated quickly.  Tasty, unique options on the menu.  Come hungry! Large portions. Loved the upbeat servers, made the experience at the table relaxed.  Big parties are welcome and we did not feel rushed or a burden with all our questions about the menu! We will be back! Thank you!"
1246,Hash House A Go Go,5,"On portion sizes alone I'd have given at least 4 stars but the staff is welcoming and friendly. The vibe is really fun, people are dancing the food is flying out of the kitchen. 
The portion sizes will have you overwhelmed but the dishes do not lack in flavor I literally ate myself sleepy.

If you're looking for a fun place to eat and soak up the alcohol... This is definitely it"
1247,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is delicious.  Service was great I would come back for sure. Might come in here around the morning to try out breskfast
1248,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place was fun to go to in a group but unfortunately not for the small appetite or anyone who doesn't like their food options to touch much.  Heh-heh!

The house mimosa made with tangerine juice was very tasty, and my co-diners told me the BLT Mary was really good, too.

Every platter (even a simple Caesar salad) came out big enough for 2+ people and arranged in some unique design.  (With my friend's chicken and waffles, it was like a tower.)  I had the biscuits and gravy.  I didn't want mashed potatoes and had hoped to give that part to my husband, because they said they couldn't substitute for anything else.  But I didn't know they surround the mashed potatoes with biscuits, cover the entire plate with gravy, and then toss the scrambled eggs on top of the whole thing, which made giving him the mashed potatoes impossible.  It was quite a sight!"
1249,Hash House A Go Go,5,"been here a couple times for bkfst/ brunch 
the sage fried chicken n waffles is massive!!! good for 3 people at least stacked high fried chicken waffles bacon eggs awesome 
Other items the farm scrabbles are good with biscuit (which could be more moist) kind of dry the few times I had it 
Overall very good faster service using diamond preferred"
1250,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My friend had been bugging us to go here since we arrived. We saved it for the last day.  We should have gone here earlier.  food is great, large portions, I could eat here and only need one other meal throughout the day and not have to worry.  I probably would have saved a good amount of money if I did that instead of eating every few hours. 

We ordered the flap jack, the Andy's plate (man vs. Food), and the egg/avacado scrambler. 

It was great food, huge portions and fast service."
1251,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go is restaurant serving up a mix of Southern and down home farmland cooking or ""Twisted farm food"" as they say. They have 4 locations in Nevada and one in California serving breakfast, lunch and dinner.

I'd heard all the fuss about Man vs Food and knew I better check this place out. We were a group of 10 and since reservations weren't allowed, we expected a long wait. We arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday surprised to see no line and lots of empty tables.  It's never a good sign for a place to be that empty on a Friday, but maybe it's because it's so hidden within the Imperial Palace Casino. 

I grew up eating food like this, but never have I seen such large portions and presentation. We were served complementary biscuits before dinner. These things were impressively huge, but a bit too dense. I prefer a light and fluffy biscuit, but easily ate a half of one drizzled with honey.  For the main course, I ordered the sage fried chicken benedict. This thing could have fed a family of four, with two boneless pieces of fried chicken served over a biscuit, mashed potatoes, tomatoes, spinach and covered with scrambled eggs, bacon, mozzarella and chipotle cream sauce for $15.95.  Overall the dish looked impressive, but didn't wow me on taste. It was good, but I expected bold flavors and didn't get it. Of course I was happy to sample several other people's food at the table like the meatloaf pasta, the BBQ ribs and the chicken pot pie.  I found the pot pie to be the best out of everything I tried. The meatloaf pasta was good, but the St. Louis style ribs were disappointing, but of course I am spoiled being from St. Louis. Probably the most entertaining part of the experience was watching a drunk guy at a table nearby devour his platter of chicken benedict without passing out in it.

Overall, I'd give this place 5 stars for friendly service and amazingly large and creative portions, but only 3 stars on taste that doesn't match presentation.  Definitely worth a visit though just for the experience!"
1252,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was recommended by a Las Vegas bartender working at another hotel.  He suggested that whatever we ordered, we should split because the portions are huge.  Boy, was he right.  We tried a corned beef sandwich, a stuffed hamburger, and one of their salads.  All were very large, cooked to perfection and very tasty.  The waitresses were also very friendly and attentive."
1253,Hash House A Go Go,2,"My husband and I went for anniversary to Vegas and on our last day decided to try Hash house, The food was good HUGE Gigantic portions. After we ate, we paid, went down escalators and realized my husband left his $1000 oakley prescription sunglasses on table, We  went directly back upstairs and they were gone. The manager, Treasure, assured us that she had no thieves  working for her , she tried to call her manager to the front and she would not come to meet with us, My husband took the manager to the table we ate at and searched for the glasses. No luck. We explained that someone had to have taken them that is on her staff. No one else could have stolen the glasses. No help what so ever!!!! We went and filed a complaint with the hotel security,( Robert, who btw was amazing) We flew home sad that our trip had been ruined by one thief. Fast forward 3 days .. guess what!!! the sunglasses MAGICALLY appeared on the restaurants managers desk !!! HMMMMMMMMM!!! seems there is a thief at Hash House!!! We had to pay the 12.00 to have them shipped back lol funny a casino or a restaurant couldn't foot the 12 bucs since their employee stole the item..My hint to future visitors  DO NOT Accidentally   LEAVE ANY ITEMS THERE OR THEY WILL BE GONE!!!!!!!"
1254,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place wasn't bad.. It was a little hard to find this place, but it's on the strip in the LINQ, upstairs so it's at least pretty quiet. On busier times, I recommend just making a reservation on OpenTable.

The decor is very farm like. Cow hides and a barn feel. It was funky but quaint. Lots of seating though and good for huge groups. The staff were all friendly but busy, so I had to wave them down to get water refilled and our checks, since she didn't come to the table as much as I'd like. 

The menu is massive! But they have a ton of breakfast classics, like eggs benedicts and pancakes, but also tons of lunch and dinner options. 

The drinks menu is also super fun. Plenty of fun, frozen, and fruity drinks available in the crazily tilted glasses! It's a fun souvenir and it comes with plenty of liquor.

The food was GIGANTIC. The proportions in one dish could easily feed three people. My husband got the chicken and waffles. The waffles had bacon in the waffles. He also got several pretty perfectly fried pieces of chicken. 

I got the crab sandwich. As someone raised in Maryland, I'm pretty picky about my crab and this was legitimately delicious. I didn't get it on a bun, thank goodness, because it was already a ton of food and I got a salad on the side. The side salad had cucumber ranch dressing, which was creamy and refreshing. The croutons were weird...I think it was fried polenta cubes. And there were these weird cracker sticks on top of the salad that I wasn't crazy about. But all the other food was great. 

Overall, a great place to get a lot of food for a decent price."
1255,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Located in the LINQ, and having come from the likes of the Bellagio and MGM Grand we were unprepared for the clouds of smoke, bumpin' music, and drunkenness that we somehow missed at the other hotels. 

My friend got a strange pebble-looking object in her water and my peach tea left an odd taste in my mouth. When we were finally ready to order, I opted for the healthier farm scramble with bacon, avocado, and swiss- though I had my eye on the infamous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. My food was as good as it could be, but my friend's chocolate waffle with ice cream was actually quite good (waffle still crisp after holding ample amounts of ice cream). Wish I would have ordered something more exciting but I suspect my 2-hour later stomach would have disagreed."
1256,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We went here for dinner after some recommendations from some friends. It is buried a few floors down in the Quad, which can be a little bit of a pain to get to due to construction. We were told there was a wait to be seated, but when we looked in the restaurant, there were open tables everywhere. We were told that they were short staffed, but then he seated us quickly after that. For being short staffed, the service was totally acceptable. Drinks are moderately priced (for vegas at least). We all ordered different items: the swordfish, salmon, butternut squash/risotto, duck breasts, and the crispy pork (I think?). Pretty much everyone at the table was pleased with their food, and the portions are enormous. I thought it was one of the best deals on the strip, paying 18.95 for a good fresh meal over bland/overpriced room service or some bad buffet. 

All in all, if you want a fair priced HUGE meal, its a great place. I will be back on future vegas trips for sure. Their breakfast looked amazing, btw."
1257,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very huge portions, but delicious food. If you are hungry, go here! Because you will have left overs for sure."
1258,Hash House A Go Go,3,"AMAZING FOOD , WORST SERVICE. They need more servers on just like most restaurants on the strip. Not only lack of service, but bad service when my waiter did come around. If I came back it would have to be at a less busy time. Because the food was amazing!"
1259,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have eaten at several locations of this sort of chain restaurant, and have not been disappointed. This is a great place for a hungry person to get their grub on!
The portions are ridiculously large, yet the food isn't just all gimmick, it actually tastes pretty damn good. The biscuits are huge, fluffy,  delicious, and complimentary!
The Sage Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict is just ridiculous!! It is huge and so damn good, but it's enough food for 3 people easily. I shudder at how much food gets wasted here, but it is what it is!
The Chicken and Waffles is another good option, as is any of the burgers. The only human sized meal on the menu is the basic breakfast and even it's plenty of food.
This place is definitely worth trying if your super hungry!!"
1260,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must must dining experience when in vegas!  I dined here 3 times during our four day trip (it was THAT GOOD)!  Each meal was absolutely fabulous! I highly recommend the fried chicken breakfast quesadilla or green fried tomato and chicken salad.  During one of our dinners, I noticed a fellow diner eating macaroni  & cheese, and it looked so divine I had to try it as well! They place these crunchy fried dried spaghetti noodles which is a very unique garnish.  If you are a drinker, then you MUST ORDER A MARGARITA.  My husband and I love margaritas.  This margarita is by far one of the best tasting we've ever had in our lives! The citrus tastes freshly squeezed and well balanced."
1261,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After watching it featured on multiple shows I had to make it a stop on my Vegas itinerary. 
I got the sage fried chicken and waffles, my Mom got the Sage fried chicken Benedict. They looked great! Pic taken, Facebooked it!
I was really sad once I ate it. It really needed some salt, the breading tasted like mushy cornflakes with a hint of sage. I almost cried-not really but I was so bummed. 
Maybe I got the wrong thing? High expectations, lackluster food, no refills offered on water or coffee (boooo).
I may try a different location, will def try another dish..."
1262,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was one of the stops on my recent restaurant.com tour of dining in Vegas.  The $25.00 coupon made it a screaming deal.

I had the signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was much better this time than the last time I had it.  Perhaps it was because I had a lower blood alcohol content.  It's just so much food. It provided breakfast the next morning too.

My son (9) had the kids burger with fries.  He too got about half way through it.  It appeared to be a real hand formed patty.  He ordered a side of bacon to add to the burger.   I had a piece.  I wish bacon like that could be bought in the grocery store.

My wife had the Griddled Cheese Sandwich.  Delicious and a great value at $10.95.

The Bloody Marys were average and I thought overpriced.  Not what I would consider 5 star.

The service was superior.  I think the best service I had anywhere during my recent 3 days in Vegas.  They were not crowded, which was nice, on  Tuesday about 8PM when we visited."
1263,Hash House A Go Go,4,We came for breakfast and came out beyond stuffed. The wait was not long at all and everyone was very nice and welcoming. Our server was amazing. He showed us the best choices from the menu and he did not stear us wrong. We picked the chicken and waffles and the chicken/eggs benedict. They were huge and looked amazing. The taste was even better. We loved every bite and we're full for the rest of the day. Definitely recommend!!
1264,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great first experience had me back a second time in a weekend! First of all, it is true, be ready to share! Don't be a pig! And be ready to wait as well on some mornings. The wait sucks, but the place is good! The line to the hostess stand is usually crowded with people waiting, so make sure to go up front and talk to someone. Most likely people are waiting and not in line. 

Once seated, the friendly server got our drink orders in and out to us in a jiffy! I had the Chorizo skillet - pretty tasty and HUGE! my wife had the Sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese scramble. We also had a Traditional Buttermilk pancake. Was really good! The coffee hit the spot as well, forget the swill at the buffet, this was a good bean! Wife had the Bloody and it was fantastic in all its greatness. Really tasty too!

I noticed alot of people taking pics of the gigantic plates of food and were laughing at the idea of actually finishing the food in front of them. So share if ya can. I did not finish the feast, but as I rolled out the door, there was a smaller line of hungry people that were pissed because I was grinning from ear to ear in full happiness! 

Try it at least once."
1265,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The place isn't bad  even tho some of the food looked piled up why 3 stars...

Everytime i go there my order is missing something... Service is fair but dont expect to be fast because they have sh!t ton of ppl eating and the waiting time can take hours and you need to be there since they don't give pagers or text u. Will i go back?...sure since i already know what to expect.
 
And as for price its can be expensive."
1266,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is amazing. Very fresh but wayyyyyyy too big of servings!!! I was actually sick when we went there and couldn't taste or smell but I could tell it was quality that's how good it was! I can't wait to go back!!!
1267,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Located inside the newly renovated LINQ casino, Hash House A Go Go is very good choice among restaurants on ""The Strip"".  Be prepared for large portions of food that you can't finish!

A few things, when coming here for lunch or dinner, it gets very crowded, expect a 15 or more wait for a table.  The good news is that the staff is extremely efficient and quick and the tables turns in a rapid pace.  Even better news is that if you are a Platinum or Diamond member, you can bypass the line and will get seated right away.

My two favorites when ordering here is the smoked salmon eggs benedict and the chicken waffles.  I was never disappointed with either choice.  Both entrees will cost you around $20 tax and tip included, a bargain in my book.

Highly recommended."
1268,Hash House A Go Go,3,"So unlike Wicked Spoon, this place is RIDICULOUSS in portion sizes. Huge portions that will stuff an entire family! 

We got the chicken and waffles and the duck. The chicken was dry but the waffles were okay. I personally don't like the combination of the two together so I didn't like it, but I saw many people eating it.

The duck was delicious and super juicy!! I loved the potato/sweet potato mash they included with it. The only thing I HATED about this was the goat cheese that was just put there. I didn't feel like the flavors mixed and the goat cheese literally made me want to gag. 

Probably won't come back because its a one time type of thing. But it was a great experience!"
1269,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Have eaten here many times, but tonight it sucked! All I wanted was a side of blueberries on top of my waffle. 
Manager said they can't do that because it changes the flavor profile and presentation. 
BUT we can serve the blueberries cold on the side.  Are you kidding me?! You can't just put them on the waffle so they're warm?! Insane! 
Since when did a small request for a customer become impossible? Have we become so brand-obessed that we longer care about the customer? RIDICULOUS!"
1270,Hash House A Go Go,5,Omgosh love love love this place. My husband and I stayed at Caesar's Palace but walked over to the Linq hotel to give this place a try. Service was good and the food was worth the short hot walk. The portions are big so if you're not incredibly hungry consider sharing a plate.
1271,Hash House A Go Go,2,"A two hour wait from putting in our name, to finally receiving our food.  

Not really worth the wait, and definitely not worth the money spent.   The food was mediocre at best and much too over-hyped for the price and flavor points.   

My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles, and I got the waffle combo.  They were regular ass waffles, only my boyfriend's was stacked ridiculously and uselessly high and skewered with rosemary.  It was almost impossible for him to eat it.  Mine was plain waffles, with regular sides. 

I wasn't impressed with the service, as she stopped by our tables once to fill coffee and that was it until she brought us our food 1.5 hours later.  If we hadn't been seated already, we would have left.  If we hadn't heard such INCREDIBLE reviews, we would have left.

I left disappointed and I don't like being disappointed by waffles.  Sorry Hash House.  While you were conviently so close to our hotel room, you were not so good and very busy."
1272,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge entrees. We came here for a very early dinner because we had 11pm reservations elsewhere. We told our waitress this and she totally said ""you came to the wrong place, but how about appetizers?"" So we ordered a few appetizers and drinks. Drinks were great. I was definitely expecting the appetizers to be bigger compared to the entrees but I'm not complaining... crab cake is a must!!! We came for breakfast after checking out on a Sunday. The place was a buzz... lots of people but we expected that and waited about 30 minutes. Seriously. Best fried chicken ever. I ordered the man vs food favorite chicken benny. I took my left overs, smooshed them into my ice chest and brought them back home to California. I have no regrets. My husband got the hangover burger but was seriously jealous of mine. 

When leaving there was roughly a 2 hour wait for being seated. These employees really work hard and are awesome. This place is a must if nearby."
1273,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is a must if you are in Las Vegas. Great place to have brunch. Beware the portions are huge, so be prepared to bring your appetite. Every dish here is good enough for two. My favorite here is the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Huge big pieces chicken breast, lightly floured and fried to perfection. Its crispy on the outside, perfectly seasoned and very moist on the inside. The waffles was thick, but crisp. Must also try the Bloody Mary. Spicy with just the right ration of tomato juice and vodka, topped with tomato, celery, slice of tomato and yes a crispy bacon strip. Service staff are very friendly, professional and attentive."
1274,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here late at night with a large group and was seated right away. I ordered ""The Basic"" consisting of eggs, potatoes, and bacon. True to it's name, the meal was quite basic and was probably very basic to cook -- as the eggs seemed to be made from the powder variety and potatoes were over-cooked. 

Three stars because my friends enjoyed their meals (flapjacks seemed to be good) and huge portions of food are given for those Las Vegas after-club appetites."
1275,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Basic Bloody Mary $15.  Mimosas $10.  Most breakfast options $15+.  The food is good, but the wait is insane.  But, the most stressful part of this visit is the yelling by staff members---the hostess yelling ""Excuse me!,"" the bar team yelling directions at a pitch high level, and the sports announcer level of noice from the wait list.  It's a lot first thing in the AM when I'm still waking up.  But, in fairness, there are probably a lot of people who would say they couldn't hear what they were saying at this noise level from so many people waiting."
1276,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food was big portioned and sooooo good. Michael our server was very informative, helpful, high energy. This cutie pie was such a great addition to our ending trip in Vegas. 

The corn beef hash was really good compared to many I've had.  The lot pie was really creamy and delicious. The chicken and waffles was a little dry for my taste but having the bacon cooked in the waffle is definitely unique. 

Over all a great trip to this place and I will definitely be coming back, next time taking my boyfriend"
1277,Hash House A Go Go,5,One of the best meals and drinks I have ever had. Definitely will be dining hear again when I return to Vegas! Our waiter was attentive and efficient!
1278,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Expected a lot considering this was a restaurant in Vegas! They have a certain section on the menu where the food portions are huge! My table ordered 3 meals and it was more than enough for 4 guys (we actually took the leftovers to-go). If I can remember we had the fried chicken and waffles as one waffle was spot on but the chicken was dry... We also had the meatloaf on mashed potatoes covered in cheese which hit home for the guys. The last dish was the pasta, the sauce was seasoned perfectly. Be careful of their bread they serve you in the beginning, it was so good that we kept ordering some before our meal."
1279,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're a fan of unbelievable breakfast, don't look any further than HH. On a recent trip to Las Vegas, we needed some great food and a Bloody Mary to cure the blues from the night before. The portions will satisfy even the largest people on the planet. Think of a pancake as big as the turkey platter you just used. Yes, that big. They also offer tons of other plates equally as large, so bring your appetite.
The ambience is very ""farm-like"" so if you're into tractors and combines and such, you'll feel right at home. Everyone that works there is dressed the part and is as friendly as you'd expect from Indiana or Arkansas. Service was prompt and courteous. 
Very important for me- if you're not a fan of Starbucks, Hash House will make you a much better cup of coffee to go. They score extra points for that in my book!"
1280,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Giant portions, great prices, amazing food. I ordered the sage fried chicken Benedict after seeing it on tv, so you know it has to be good, and it was, it really was. I couldn't even finish half of it, and I'm a big eater."
1281,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Worst worst worst dining experience ever. Waited an hour to get my meal when the other tables, who came way later than us got their meals before me (they ordered the same foods that I ordered).  Didn't hear an apology at all from the waitress which made me more upset.  she just tried to avoid talking to me.  I would never go back"
1282,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I came in on Sunday for a brunch with my cousin and the service was excellent!! Now I've heard great things but this was beyond my expectations! The portion of the food is ridiculously big, but in a good way!! I'll definitely be returning!"
1283,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really solid food. We got the fried chicken tower and the two eggs, one pancake breakfast set. The fried chicken was honestly a teeny bit dry, but the flavor was really good. The breakfast was solid too. A little bit pricey but you get a lot of food.

Biggest con is probably the wait time. But we just got it to go and 20 minutes later were walking up to our room with it."
1284,Hash House A Go Go,5,The service has been much better recently. I've been seated promptly and my server has gotten my tangerine juice out right away.
1285,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow! The first thing that comes to mind when we got our food! But first I must say that this was the number one place on my list to try when I went to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago. I saw it on the food network and travel channel. Apparently there are multiple locations, but we went to the one that was on the Vegas strip in the Quad.

Upon entering the lobby from the escalators the fist thing noticeable are the numerous pictures of celebrities and their autographs along the wall. That being said, it had to good...because we had to justify the 30-45 min. wait for a table! Worth it in the end though.

As we sat down, the server was very upbeat and friendly given how busy the restaurant was. In my experience, the tone and vibe of a busy restaurant will reflect through the server. I felt very welcomed and excited to be trying this place out though. The first thing we asked was for recommendations and he gave us the top 3 most popular dishes. Out of the six of us, we decided to order all 3 of them plus one! The ones were the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles, Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Big O' Chicken Pot Pie and the Chorizo House Hash. Full menus are online, but each dish was super! 

My personal favorite was the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. This was superb! The sage really was present in the fried chicken and was totally different from any other ""chicken & waffles"" I ever had. The taste was really ""upscale"" but very, very good! The other people in our party didn't like the unique taste because of the overwhelming taste of sage...but that was the reason it stood out for me so much. I am not picky and love new foods, especially new tastes that I had never had before. The fried chicken was juicy and of course tasted well with the bacon! The Everyone loved the waffles! Very soft on the inside but nicely crisp on the outside. And it all worked very well with the maple syrup reduction...Such a dream! 

The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was similar in taste as far as the fried chicken portion, but was different in texture with the biscuit base, chipotle cream and griddled mozzarella. Very rich and good.

The last two were the Chorizo House Hash and Big O' Chicken Pot Pie. Both were the favorites among the group as a whole. The chorizo was very good, not too salty, which I have come across on numerous occasions having the meat at various restaurants. A bit spicy with the jalapeÃ±os, but I love spice personally. Everyone devoured this dish as well as the Pot Pie. The shell/crust of the pot pie was mouthwatering. That part of the dish was gone in a flash! so flaky and buttery went well with the roasted chicken filling and gravy!

I must say these dishes individually are Large! Just one of them can feed 2-3 normal individuals. And for the price, very worth it! Each dish was presently superbly especially the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Every time that came out of the kitchen to a different table people would be astonished and stare as the towering masterpiece found its home in a new customer.

This is a super recommendation if you are ever nearby or decide to take a trip to Las Vegas! Go Now!"
1286,Hash House A Go Go,5,"WOW!  What a meal.  Had their signature dish and was incredible.  Wife and I shared it and still couldn't finish it.  

Highly recommend this place if you are hungry for great food.

Our typical goto spot was mon ami gabby at Paris but now this is now our future breakfast place while in Vegas"
1287,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First timer in Vegas and everyone raved about this place. Amazing food, friendly staff. Our waiter Toby was phenomenal!!! I'd recommend this place to everyone and I will definitely be back."
1288,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must stop when you are in vegas. Insane home made bloodys and unreal delish portions of food.  In the old imperial palace aka linq.

You should share a plate with a friend but you wont be able to help yourself ordering more. Yea the line is long.. Its always long.. Chill out.. Its vegas. Put your name in, get a bloody and go gamble for 30 min. Your liver will thank you."
1289,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Good food, but easily enough to split.  Loved the basil and cheese eggs, good potatoes.  The portions are gigantic (and for your heart's sake, I would advise splitting a meal), so come hungry."
1290,Hash House A Go Go,5,Went there for brunch . Portion was big . Food and service were great ! Kind of dark inside needs a little more light . But overall the price wasn't expensive at all !! Will definitely try again if ever in Vegas!
1291,Hash House A Go Go,3,"A tad disappointed when I was here last. Seems like the menu has gone downhill. Food wasn't as flavorful as it used to be, however the staff was very nice and friendly."
1292,Hash House A Go Go,5,We went to Hash House for brunch Friday morning and we're not disappointed. Our group of 8 was seated quickly and the service was great. A couple tips- it can be tough to find so go inside linq and ask for directions if you don't see it. Also split an entree as they are HUGE but delicious!
1293,Hash House A Go Go,3,I did it. I tried it. Meh. Probably won't go back. Service was friendly but slow. Food was abundant but definition of gluttonous.
1294,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is our go to for drunk food they are open 24 hours. We go here everytime we come to vegas and the service and food never dissapoint. Their servings are enormous so sharing would be ideal. Your first time try the chicken and waffles. Its a must! The waffle has a bacon piece in it and the dish looks exactly how they promote it.

The sage fried chicken benedict is ridiculous in size. And it is awesome. Seems like 3 times the size of a dennys or ihop meal haha.  It comes with two pieces of chicken

Good luck going here for breakfast its way packed and you will probabaly wait 30 to 45 minutes. This is why I would go during dinner or after the club when there is no wait if you want to try this place."
1295,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait for Sunday brunch is horrendous (about 45 min to an hour for a party of 6 when we checked in with the hostess around 12PM). They also do NOT take day of reservations on the weekends (boo!). However, they seemed to turnover tables pretty quickly - and to my surprise - actually had plenty of empty tables when we got seated. 

The menu is expansive. You have your sweet, your savory, your burgers, and your hashes. I ordered the rosemary chicken hash which came with: two eggs however you want it, breakfast potatoes, and a large biscuit. Although the chicken was not as well seasoned as the description seemed to claim, it was cooked well and nicely complemented by the sautÃ©ed asparagus. 

BE WARNED: The portions are gargantuan, so consider sharing with a friend when you are ordering. I swear my eyes almost popped out of my head when I saw how large some of my friends and neighbors' dishes were when they arrived at the table. Although my hash platter was not large in comparison to some of the other dishes that arrived at our table, I ate my fill and still had enough left over for breakfast the next day! 

The only downside -  our waitress wasn't particularly friendly, and made obvious that we were a burden to her load, but my friends and I enjoyed each others company and had a great time anyway."
1296,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Sooo...about this place. I went here due to seeing this place on the food network and pure curiosity about their large stacked plates. My friends didn't believe me when I said each plate is the size of a house, so to prove them wrong we trekked down the strip to the LINQ hotel and we were met with a crowded restaurant and a 45 minute wait for a party of four. Although things were moving pretty quickly and they were serving bloody Mary's and mimosa in the waiting we were STARVING! 

Know what didn't make it better? The waiters and waitresses walking by with platters of every type of fatty goodness you can think of. We finally got to our table (Praise God) and since we had menus in the waiting room we all knew what we wanted immediately. My friends decided on chicken and waffles, French toast, and then a regular breakfast platter (she's boring and picky) and I got decided on A wild Andy or something (don't quote me on that) but it came with chicken mashed potatoes cantaloupe tomatoes eggs bacon and a biscuit it doesn't seem like it all goes together but when the waiter sets it down in front of you...you just eff it and dig in. To shorten up this small sermon. Food was awesome. Restaurant was busy. Service was great and we all ended up like everybody else that was leaving the restaurant....nauseous cause we ate so much, waddling downstairs because we ended up gaining an extra 4lbs, and low key satisfied we got to indulge in our glutinous fantasies."
1297,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I think a lot of the reviews have overly hyped this spot.

It's huge portions but the food quality is lacking.  Ordered a burger and while I seldomly have burgers it was overly huge but tasted terrible.  McDonald's has a better hamburger than this place.

If your looking for drunky food late night this might be a decent spot but be prepared to spend 25 - 30 bucks for breakfast food

8/6/2017 Edit: Thank you Brannon R. of Hash House A Go Go for responding regarding lack of flavor.  If you are looking to improve, regarding the burger,  season the patty with anything -- coriander, salt, pepper, anything... that would be my suggestion.    My burger had 4 main items.  sliced tomato, lettuce, ground beef, and mashed potato.  All four of these items felt completely unseasoned.   Grilling ground beef straight up on a flattop provides a pretty gritty flavor,  in addition to the loads of butter on the bun (which was crisp).   What you end up is with a greasy, but bland burger."
1298,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg!!! This is a lot of food. If you want to eat one time and then dinner, thus is the place for you. It's totally affordable especially if you split the food between two people. The pancakes are so oversized. As you can see by the picture it hangs over the plate. We shared the Tractor plate with a pancake. We left most of it there. The next time we split the chicken and waffles. We both left full. The biscuits are awesome. I had one with each meal. A good place to go that won't break the budget. First meal was $27 and the second meal was $24. Caution: the large orange juice was $6.50. Great food."
1299,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had the leaning tower of fried chicken and waffles. The chicken is world famous and the waffles were amazing. 

The only way it would have been 5 star is with maple syrup for the waffles, or if there was a different flavor of syrup option... but I understand that would have made the price go up so I take the slightly bad with the very good.

Overall this place is ridiculously good. The staff work super hard, and they are moving a million miles an hour. Super happy with the experience."
1300,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Do NOT, I repeat DO NOT eat before you get here. The food was AMAZING. I had the fried green tomatoes with a buttered biscuit. My friends tried the bacon waffle & chicken & waffles and were equally delighted with their meals. I would definitely eat here again. Not to mention for the restaurant to be as large/crowded as it is, the service is superb and we didn't have to wait long to get our food"
1301,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went here to meet some friends for breakfast. Busy & HUGE serving sizes, i will definitely share next time, check out my pic of my blueberry pancake that was hanging off the side of the plate :) tasty but way too much food for me."
1302,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HASH HOUSE A GO GO IS A MUST GO GO!

I have died and gone to fried chicken & eggs benidict heaven! 

Their portions are huge we ordered 3 plates and for 4 girls it was way too much. I love the little decorative trees they put in the biscuits and speaking of biscuits HOLY CRACK BALLS! SMAAAACCCKIN! The service is on point too. 

You gotta order the fried chicken and eggs benidict, chorizo and hash and their fluffy SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good waffles. NOW THATS A PARTY IN YO MOUF!"
1303,Hash House A Go Go,4,"HH is a fantastic place for breakfast! Been to two locations in Las Vegas and both are consistent. Plan on waiting because this place is popular and rightly so.....but it's well worth the wait. I had the dishes from the traditional breakfast to chicken and waffles. If you like pancakes, I highly recommend the Snickers pancakes....yuuuuummm!"
1304,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You had me at brunch. Hash hash, you did not disappoint!

After reading several reviews about the long waits, we placed a name down on the waiting list for a group of 7 since reservations are not taken on the weekends. The hostess estimated an hour+ wait, but it was actually half that time. My friends and I went downstairs to the tables and gambled for 30 minutes, then went back to check the wait status. Lucky us, there was a table ready when we checked back in!

Time to break down the ratings for the food inducing coma items. WARNING: The following items listed were shared family style, the servers will remind you their portions are huge and sharing is advised unless your level of hangry is off the charts.

Sage Fried Chicken (5/5): The ultimate bomb dot com entree you want for brunch. One of the most popular dishes and we could all see why. Gravy + biscuit + chicken, that deadly delicious combo had our tastebuds going.

Corned Beef House Hash (5/5): One of the best corned beef hashes I've had. You could taste the strips of corned beef which was salted to perfection.

Buttermilk Flapjack Pancakes (5/5): At the end of the day, pancakes are pancakes... The specialty of Hash Hash pancakes is that its served as one flapjack and measures 14 inches in diameter! You aren't missing on much if you decide to forgo pancakes, but it's a great item to share in large groups.

Ham, Spinach, & Cheddar Farm Scrambles (3.5/5): My least favorite dish, there's nothing special about it. The group wanted an item with eggs since the rest was already carb heavy. Can't have brunch without eggs.

On top of the food being amazing, it is also super affordable, the amount everyone paid for was roughly around $10/each (unless you ordered special drinks). Hash hash definitely belongs to the Vegas strip."
1305,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just go here! It's an experience and worth it. 
We had to walk far to find this in The LINQ and then go up a flight of stairs because the escalator was broken when we were there. However, the service was great, seating went pretty fast considering the waiting room was packed full. The food was stacked high, fresh and I wish there was a Hash House close to me! If you're dieting or watching what you eat, you probably don't want to go here. The drink selection is outrageous! Oh this place is LOUD and crowded so if you're looking for quiet and romantic this is not the place. This is hardcore comfort food porn!"
1306,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Service wasn't the best, but considering how busy it was, I didn't really mind. The food was awesome...HUGE portions! I got the smoked salmon scramble? Not sure what the actual name of it on the menu was. But the Bloody Marys WON me over. I absolutely loved them - plus they've got a Bloody Mary bar (also serves screwdrivers) to keep you entertained while waiting to be seated. Also tried their banana pancakes.. Amazing!!!!!"
1307,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent place to eat for breakfast or brunch.  The portions are considerably large so you could share for sure.  The service was also outstanding.  We will definitely go back when we come back to Vegas!
1308,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG...This restaurant is superb and the food is beyond decadent! I had heard that the portions were astronomical in size, but I had NO CLUE they were of flintstone size!! I am beyond impress with this establishment, the food, and the service! If you come to Las Vegas, this must be on your place to visit list!"
1309,Hash House A Go Go,3,waiting in line is worth it...but the hostess was rude and the music is way too loud!
1310,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place definitely receives a 5 star for me. Place was still under renovation of some sort when we went today but they have managed to keep the place clean and organized. Wait is pretty long during peak hours. We were told our wait was an hour or so when we arrive at around 10am but we were already called by 40 mins.

Food was definitely great! Their portions are HUGE!! So consider sharing or not buying too much unless you're up for the challenge.

We've tried their famous sage fried chicken and waffles and my goodness was it delicious! Both batter and meat tasted amazing! I was also able to try their chicken benedicts and the sauce/gravy whatever it was was rich and tasty. If you have noticed the photo i had, their flapjacks were humongous! It was a challenge eating even half of it so i had to bring it to go. All of the food we got were so worth the wait! Heck even their milk tasted great! Definitely a go to place!"
1311,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Oh My Goodness!!! My wife & I went to Vegas to ,well, I went for the Buffetts...she went tor the $$$. We were BOTH disappointed. The Buffett was about $ 60 each!! Did I say EACH, yeah that's what it was,and ""we"" didn't win ANY money!! However, the pleasant surprise was Hash House A GoGo!!! Our meal was about $ 35 TOTAL,and we were STUFFED!!!. I had the meatloaf, but it also had Mozarella over top of fresh Mash Pototoes.with sautÃ©ed veggies underneath. WOW!!! Yummie!!!. Hash House was the most pleasant part of Vegas for me!!"
1312,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions, loud, hot, long wait...waffle was tasty and the potato quesadilla was amazing! Had a ton of yummy drinks to choose from; might come back to try one or two."
1313,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Breakfast was MASSIVE and delicious. Our waitress, whose name I didn't catch was very nice and efficient. Ryan the host was also fantastic. It was so crazy busy, but he was friendly and chatted while we waited. We had waffles, pancakes, potatoes and bacon. My only complaint about the food is my bacon could have been a little crispier, but it was still tasty. Definitely a place worth checking out for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner. And if it was SO LOUD I think it would have been five stars. With the crowd it's a bit overwhelming with the loud music."
1314,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Yelp let me down on this one. If i'm rating the portion size I will give this place 5 star. Every plate that came out is at least good for 2 people unless you're Adam from Man vs. Food. I ordered the sage fried chicken and it was cold, and extremely dry that I took a bite and just put aside. My husband ordered the biscuit and gravy also only had a few bites and we left."
1315,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went to this location and LOVED IT! We were seated right away on a busy Friday morning, Our server was fantastic and very quick, and the food was absolutely amazing! Only part we didn't like was that it was super loud in there, but it was so amazing we would definitely be back."
1316,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After watching Man vs. Food I had to come to this place. ~30 waiting during the holidays.  To start I had the smore's mocha, after that you need no dessert. Also tried the watermelon lemonade which wasn't great but was pretty good.  Tried Andy's Sage fried chicken and was delicious,  the chipotle sauce made it great.  Also tried the hamburger,  which was ""normal"". BIG portions, share!! Total we ended up paying $47. Good service. Planning on coming back again!!"
1317,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hands down the Best Bloody Mary ever!!! My hubby loves the bacon waffles and rosemary chicken breakfast. I loved the biscuits and gravy and they have awesome pancakes. The food is great and presentation makes you wanna dig right in. 

Go hungry because portions are BIG!"
1318,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came here on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. We ordered the chicken and waffles, and the blue crab cake and pasta. The portions are huge and the presentation are nice. We were excited for the chicken and waffles, but we were SO sad that the chicken was not moist but  was dry. Is it a hit and miss here?! The crab cake was full of crab which was great and I enjoyed it. The pasta was alrights, nothing too special. 

The service was ehh, she forgot our cup of maple syrup until halfway eating so we felt weird eating plain waffles. Do you get complimentary biscuits during dinner time like what the reviews say? Our server forgot that.. We did appreciate the buser coming around and picking up the plates though."
1319,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HUGE portions of food to share.  Breakfast was amazingly delicious and cocktails are served strong, yes for breakfast- - don't judge. 
Service is friendly and recommendation for my plate was spot on!"
1320,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go..where have u been all my life? Man, that was a delicious salmon egg benedict with a side of potatoes. Yum..can't wait to go back There was a wait.. We were told 50 minutes but actually waited 20. Portions are huge. Waiter was super nice and sweet."
1321,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The chicken and waffles was awesome and huge!! I couldn't even finish the plate. Coffee was strong and probably needed after hanging out in Las Vegas!

Chicken was thigh and leg aka leg quarter flattened and crispy with slight hint of sage. Waffles were soft and had 4 pieces. For garnish was shredded leeks sautÃ©ed! Umm good...add some syrup too  heavenly

The line was long and had to wait for about 40 mins to 1 hour for a table of 2, but worth the wait.
 
Walked from New York New York hotel to Linq hotel and that was the longest walk of my life in 107 degree temp. Was it worth the walk yes, but would I do it again heck no ...take the tram. If you go in the morning you should ok to walk but afternoon take the tram which is $7 for single ride, $12 for 24 hours and, $28 for 3 days.

FYI bathroom downstairs in hotel near the purple zebra.!!"
1322,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Yessssir. Break-feast! LOTS of food. HUGE portions. Its open early, a great place to start your long Las Vegas day. 

The various Benedict's they offer are a sure bet. I had the one with salmon. My man the one with fried chicken. The mimosas were strong and we didn't have to wait for a table, though we did get there at 8 am. (Unheard of in Vegas...)

Visit if you want a big breakfast.
Skip if you want something cheap and quick."
1323,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food itself is 3-3.5 stars, but the prices bring it up to a solid 4.
Compared to everywhere else in Vegas, it's a good deal!

Cons:
- Potatoes are not particularly crispy.
- Only hot sauce is tabasco.
- Smoked salmon in smoked salmon scramble came out cooked, not lox-style."
1324,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We came here on a Monday morning for breakfast around 10:30 am. When we arrived, we were told the wait would be 30-40 minutes for our party of 3 but it ended up being only about 10 minutes which was great! 

I ordered the tractor driver's breakfast ($15.99 if you get a specialty pancake, $14.99 for regular buttermilk). It came with eggs, a pancake, and your choice of bacon/sausage/potatoes. The pancake was HUGE (HUGE!!!! like 5x the size of my hand huge). I got the snickers pancake and it was awesome. Everything tasted great- classic diner-esque food experience with the added novelty of the gigantic portion sizes. 

If you go, definitely be aware that even big eaters can probably split most of the dishes (or you'll end up lugging around a huge pancake all day like me haha). 

The only thing I would say is that my coffee sat empty for most of the meal before anyone came around with a pot for refills, but otherwise the service was great! They gave me the wrong side to start but quickly and happily changed it when I mentioned it. 

Overall, would 100% recommend giving Hash House a go go ;)"
1325,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place holds up to all of their reviews! It was my first time coming here and definitely didn't disappoint me. Our waitress was so friendly and recommended that we split a meal but that just wasn't happening. I ordered the banana brown sugar pancakes which came with bacon and eggs. I was only able to finish half of my pancake. It was so incredibly delicious, one of the best I've ever had! If you're looking for a lot of food, this is the place to go! Not only do they give you a large portions, the food is so delicious!"
1326,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Outstanding and worth the wait! Do not settle on something else because of the wait. I did one morning and that was a huge mistake. The Truck Driver Combo is huge and can definitely be split between 2 people, but I would order an additional side of eggs."
1327,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow! That was breakfast, lunch, and dinner! 
Portions are enormous!! And the quality is good. 
Our server, Gary, was very nice, and recommended well. 
If you go there, make sure you are veeeeeery hungry!!"
1328,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had been dying to try this place after seeing pictures of the chicken and waffles circulating around the web. I mean who wouldn't want to try a chicken and waffle tower?

i came here with a group of 4 and the wait was exceptionally long, which is something that should be expected when you are going to one of the most rated restaurants in Vegas. After standing for a near 45 minutes I could feel my stomach screaming at me from the Fat Tuesday indulgence I had the night before and from the teasing stench of crispy fried goodness. The waiter warned us that the chicken and waffles are best shared because of the sheer size of the dish. 

Boy was the waiter right. Not only was this the largest chicken and waffles I have ever seen but it was also the most delicious fried greasy bird that I have ever had. It was crispy, sweet and savory all at once. I would definitely come back to this place but next time I will make sure to come at an odd hour so I don't have to torture myself with the long wait."
1329,Hash House A Go Go,4,Fun atmosphere. Very tasty dishes with large portions. Expect to wait for a table most times during the day. I would go back
1330,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and friendly service. This is my second time being here and this beats everything on the strip of Vegas for breakfast/brunch. The menu is beyond reasonable, with food exceeding your expectations for the price, the portions are insane!... in a good way. The theme is a contemporary spin on farm diner dishes and just all around delicious."
1331,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I ordered the Sage Chicken and Waffles to go. They served it to me in a pizza box since it was the only container large enough to hold everything! 

When I took one bite of the fried chicken, I thought I was struck by lightning. The chicken was deliciously seasoned while being unbelievably moist. I tried to commit the flavor to memory, just so I can try to make it at home!

The waffles though, were not as good. They were normal, dry waffles that one would expect. The difference was that these waffles had bacon inside. It was a unique style of preparation, but I could have done without them. 

As for the sauteed leeks, I didn't really understand why they were part of the dish. But hey, I like leeks, so I'm not going to complain about them. 

Quick note about the amount of patrons. I visited at noon and there were about 30 people in line, waiting for a table. I decided to come back at 3pm, when there was no line and the restaurant was empty. If you're not in the mood to wait, I recommend showing up at the restaurant in the mid-afternoon. 

Overall, I paid 21 dollars for this giant meal and was satisfied. I'm definitely going to try the chicken pot pie when I visit this place again!"
1332,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG can you say Bloody Mary heaven?  My friend and I came to Hash House for breakfast one morning.  We walked from the Signature at MGM to the restaurant and had built up quite a healthy appetite!

For starters we ordered a Bloody Mary.  They are large and in charge, with just the right amount of spiciness to them!  And they are tall, so one really does the trick if you are feeling a little sluggish from the night before. 

I honestly do not remember the name of what I ordered but it was an egg white scramble with spinach and fruit.  I was really trying to be my usual, healthy self since I had been indulging for 4 days on booze and shitty food, and this really hit the spot!!  

This place gets crowded, and for good reason, so plan a little extra time for the wait.  But it didn't take long and the service was excellent!"
1333,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I went here twice on my Vegas vacation because it was in the hotel we were staying at (Imperial Palace). I went here for breakfast and got the largest buttermilk pancakes I have ever seen in my life for only $6.95. This amazed me due to everything being so expensive in Vegas, I assumed they would be small. Believe me, they are HUGE. I took 3/4 of the pancake to go because I was full. Then for dinner I ordered a Griddled Cheese sandwich with prosciutto. It was really good and again affordable. The breakfast server was amazing. Very friendly, helpful, and stayed on top of us despite the large amount of people. The dinner server on the other hand forgot about us several times despite there only being maybe 6 more groups in there at the time. The food was great and cheap and the restaurant has a cool vibe. Highly recommend."
1334,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food is great here, with large portion sizes and flavors galore.

Love the bloody mary bar at the entrance. Great way to pass time when you're waiting. And not to mention they're ""bloody"" good!

We only had about a 20 minute wait, but our kids were a little fussy. The bar was nice enough to give us a few slices of fruit (watermelon slices and orange slices) to distract them. Just perfect.

The only downside for me was the volume of the music. It seemed really loud, making it difficulty to talk. Good to drowning out kid noice, but a little overwhelming too with everything else going around (televisions, hustle/bustle). I think taking it down a notch would make it perfect!"
1335,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm IMPRESSED! Good lookin plates, and ALOT of food on the plate!!! Had the French toast with the Miller Lite in the bag! Wife had the Ranchero dish. She loved it! Cool little place, great service, and GOOD, clever food! You go to the Rio, buzz in there and eat! Be HUNGRY!"
1336,Hash House A Go Go,5,You will not find much better food out here than at hash house a go go!! Always a must stop for food favorites in my opinion. Don't order extra food because the portions are HUGE here and worth every penny.  Breakfast can take up to an hour to be seated on the weekends so be aware but still worth the wait.
1337,Hash House A Go Go,4,So much food! For most people there eyes will be bigger than their stomach.  Good stuff comfort food on steroids. Great friendly service. Great when we want a lot of breakfast food at anytime of the day or night. Might want to split some of the dishes.
1338,Hash House A Go Go,5,Oh so yummy! I recommend the fried green tomato stack and wash it down with the watermelon lemonade!
1339,Hash House A Go Go,4,I sat up at the bar so I didn't have to wait.  They were serving up very tasty looking drinks like Bloody Mary's and everyone sitting near me enjoyed what they ordered. I had biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs which was awesome. I could only eat half of it.
1340,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place. Food and drinks are amazing. Highly recommend if you are from out of town. Definitely consider sharing as portions are large. There is also a location off the strip that is just as great and sometimes the wait isn't as long.
1341,Hash House A Go Go,5,"best dish is the eggs benedict! plates are huge you can split them for sure. always fast service but always a long wait. 
get the bloody marys while you wait"
1342,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Had dinner with my four sisters from out of town, on 4/27/14. Entrees included the Meatloaf, Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Skillet, Guacamole Chicken Salad, and a Corned Beef Reuben. All the meals came luke warm, closer to cold. Food was lacking in flavor. I have not heard one positive thing from my sisters about that meal. So I guess you could say it was a night to forget. Definitely do not recommend this place for anyone with a discerning palate. Also, the food came fast, like it was already plated and then barely warmed up. The waiter then more or less disappeared, had no knowledge of what he was trying to sell us. Acted more or less, like he could care less about our dining experience. This was my call since I am the local. So it is my fault for not researching further."
1343,Hash House A Go Go,5,When we first went up the escalator we were bummed because it looked like the wait would be long. Thankfully they were calling out names left and right. Don't let the wait outside fool you. The food was great and the portions were stupid big. We would definitely come back again. The one thing I was especially thankful for was the payment process. They brought around an iPhone with a way to swipe your card. I love that my card never left my sight. I wish more places did this. John E. Was a fantastic server too. Will be back next time we are down this way.
1344,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Five stars for awesome food. Huge portions it's ridiculous how much is on one plate. You can seriously share with three people. Anyways I went here last year during the summer time with my cousins around the time of my 20th birthday. Yes 20 years in Vegas (nothing to do) lol when we ate here our waiter dropped my sisters food near her and ended up in her hair I remember her hair smelled like syrup lol But it wasn't a big deal. He made my sister a new chicken and waffles plate (huge portion and so delish). Over all good service , great tasting plates and good restaurant vibe. I recommend this place to anyone who go to Vegas."
1345,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always great food here. Best bargain on the strip. Most entrees can be shared. Usually grab bkft here, but decided to grab lunch instead - no regrets. 

Bkft drinks are impressive. My wife was in a sugar and chocolate coma after drinking her Smores coffee drink. I enjoyed the iced pistachio coffee drink. 

For a beverage, we had their Champagne Mojito. Good sized drink and very light and crisp. Best drink value on the strip: For the $14.99 price tag (avg drink prices now are $18-20 most places) you get an awesome drink, above avg size, plus a cool looking large, solid HH Tallboy drinking glass.

For entrees, we had the Chicken Pot Pie and the No. 5 Burger with Bacon and avocado. I'm a burger guy, but it looked and sounded better than it tasted. It was very juicy and massive, but it just didn't have a ""pop"" to it to bring the mild flavors together. The sweet potato fries were outstanding. The Chicken Pot Pie freaking rocked though. Plus, it didn't have any peas...

Wait was only 20mins for an early Monday lunch. They do take RSVPs only during the week and only if made more than 24 hrs in advance."
1346,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go comes in HUGE portions. No joke! If you are really hungry and have a huge appetite, definitely come here and be ready for the challenge! 

The wait wasn't that long for the four of us, but I'm glad there was a large menu posted on the wall so that we can already order once we were seated. It gets crowded so expect the wait. I ordered their famous chicken and waffles, which looked extremely presentable and tasted very scrumptious. I like how creative the dish can be, adding in a bit of crispy bacon to the fluffy waffles and maple syrup to the crispy chicken. I tried to finish the meal as a whole, but I ended up bringing the rest to the hotel for later! Plus, I also ordered their gigantic BLT Bloody Mary, which turned out to be just as delicious. 

Service was excellent at Hash House. The server gave us updates on our food and drinks, which is always a plus on my book.

Overall, Hash House is a must when you visit Las Vegas."
1347,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What is this place?? hahaha. I just ordered a peach Long Island and I came in a plastic tractor. We're hammered and I t's hilarious, I love it. Food is incredible and our waiter Michael was the dopest dope. Knew everything about the menu and had killer suggestions. Come with an appetite. Good coffee."
1348,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Order from the kids menu to go on busy weekend mornings, I don't think they'll allow you to order from it if you're sat tho. If ordering an adult portion it feeds 4 people, portions are huge. How many people actually eat huge breakfasts like this at home?? Breakfast was meant to be fast easy and satisfying not overwhelming to the point where come lunch time you're still stuffed."
1349,Hash House A Go Go,5,Stayed at the link for the night and was excited to find out hash house was at the Linq hotel ! Good food portions are huge . Good service despite it being so busy we waited no more than 15 min . Can't wait to come back !
1350,Hash House A Go Go,4,"if youre looking for comfort food done a little differently, this is the place to go.

its a ""tourist spot"" so be prepared for a little bit of a wait. although, the 1st time i went we had a reservation for a large dinner party and the 2nd time was right before dinner rush on a saturday night (we got sat right away).

plates are HUGE! everything we had was pretty darn good. horseradish mashed, pesto potatoes, ribs...all good. my sister ordered the crab cakes, and most of it was crab!

i ordered the watermelon kiwi lemonade. it was definitely good and refreshing, but my garnish (watermelon wedge) was definitely spoiled.

something else i liked - they serve 40oz cans of budweiser and serve it with a side of bacon. ive said this a few times, but i dont really like domestic beer, unless its used for a drinking game. oddly enough, the bacon added to the flavor of the beer and it was actually pretty good!

if you've never been, its a must try. just seeing all the plate presentations and how huge the portions are is worth it."
1351,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food was horrible,  I will never go there again, the fried chicken had no seasoning you barely taste the bacon in the waffles although kiwi spike drink is very good."
1352,Hash House A Go Go,4,a very memorable meal on our short trip to vegas.  everything was delicious and plenty of it!
1353,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food and service was ok..I don't eat a lot of food like they serve here so it's not for me personally but the people I dined with really enjoyed their food .. I ordered an apple and cinnamon flap jack w eggs that was suppose to be soft but were hard I was too hungry to send them back and some potatoes that were just ok.. Will I return probably not it did not wow me and I visit Vegas quite often and have had some really good breakfast ..
1354,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If I can only share one ""what happens in Vegas"" moment (some don't like social networks haha) I will publicize this: Hash House Is the BEST 24hr eatery on the strip. As a fan of the San Diego location and of chicken and waffles I was so ""down"" to get my grub on here! 
Located in the Quad next to the Flamingo, the location is PERFECT! If you know Vegas you know Caesars Palace, the Venetian and the new O'sheas is all just steps away... Oops talking about the trip anyway, I liked that the restaurant is large and spacious. The service is prompt and courteous and as expected the portions are HUMONGOUS! If you have not experienced Hash House A Go Go you are really missing out. Really."
1355,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Impressed by the size of the pancakes we went here for brunch. Got the blueberry pancake but it was far from edible. They overcook the hell out of it, with a hard crust like sourdough bread around the edges and a dry, chewy interior. I brought up to my server Alan, but rather than offer a replacement or alternate told us that's just the way they make them. Said too many complaints about undercooking so they go to town on them now.


So, in the spirit of Vegas, the pancake is a gamble. If you lose don't expect the house to make you whole...."
1356,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had to get Adam Richman's dish at Hash House.  My friends were still back at the room recovery from a hangover that I pushed through because I was in Vegas but got stuck in the casino gambling so now I had to get my food and eat quick because by this point everyone was up.  

Got the Sage fried Chicken Benedict.  WOOOW!! this thing was ridiculous.  It was like 4 biscuits, like two whole chicken breasts, spinach, eggs, tomatoes, whole heap of cheese, bacon and topped off with an entire sage branch.  LOL marvelous. And the chipotle cream they used wasn't quite what I expected, given my experience with many a eggs benedict, but it suited the chicken and eggs very well.

This thing was a formidable adversary and was not taken down lightly, and I was hungry.  I took most of it to-go while drinking Hash-houses house lemonade.  This proved to be dinner for me and everyone at the hotel later on that night."
1357,Hash House A Go Go,5,Must try breakfast spot in Vegas! Get there early or be prepared for a really LONG wait!
1358,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is so good! It has its own unique touch to every dish. Me and my bf ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles (most popular dish) and it was so big that we had to split it. I recommend this as a dish to share. Chicken was fried perfectly, with great flavor. The waffles were. Stuffed with bacon. I also washed it down with a lemonade mimosa. I was very pleased"
1359,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions! Huge...all the entrees are big enough to share. The cornmeal dusted shrimp was a great appetizer, even though an appetizer is definitely not needed considering the entree portions. Did I mention the portion sizes were huge? We had great service along with our gigantic food portions."
1360,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came on a Saturday morning for breakfast. It was only a short wait, we drank their yummy Bloody Mary's while we waited. 

Our server quickly came over and coffee was brought promptly and kept filled. Hubby had a couple eggs, meat, and potatoes platter. Basic stuff since he's not a big breakfast eater. I had the smoked salmon Benedict. The picture doesn't do it justice, but this thing was as big as my head!  It was two eggs on top of grilled salmon on top of a homemade biscuit on top of a huge pile of griddled mashed potatoes. It was all covered with a chili sauce. Everything was done really well, but the sauce really was a bit bland. 

Definitely will stop in again the next time we visit to try more things!"
1361,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent place to get amazing food with huge portions with amazing waitstaff. We walked from our hotel down the strip looking for a good uncrowded spot to have breakfast and relax. Did some research and this place was highly recommended. We have them a shot and I can honestly say the food was great quality and the cost was under $40 for two people.
1362,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place gets busy all times of the day!! Big big portions! Really delicious! Biscuits were a little dense and dry!
1363,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Not quite as Good as the one in SD but still Pretty Pretty Pretty Good!
Def worth stopping by!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1364,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The only good thing for this restaurant is its size. The food is really large in size. However, the food was so salty that I felt uncomfortable. The Chicken Fried Steak tastes awful. It was wrapped with thick and light fried flour-like staff and the steak was thin. The server was not really well either."
1365,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hash is famous for their chicken and waffle. But I decided to ordered the Kokomo instead which is also popular and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffle. 

I gotta say, I was disappointed. The meatloaf was dry. It wasn't what I was expecting. It was just bad. 

On the other hand, I did try the Chicken and waffle and it was good. It had crispy skin and you can taste the sweet syrup on it. Well I think it's syrup. 

So the bad: The wait time was super long. It was  About 45 min. And another 40 min for the food.

The good: chicken was okay good and the beer. 

Overall, the chicken was good but nothing spectacular."
1366,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You know when people write "" this place has big servings"", and you go ""yeah yeah yeah whatever im hungry ill eat it all....""

 well this place has impossible to finish gynormous servings that can serve three on one plate. So  don't be a fool, and share your plate with your date. And oh yeah the chow is good.

did i say good- i mean frickin awesome.  take it to the bank"
1367,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Terrible management.  

Came here late at night and the chicken was served cold.  I did not want to cause a scene and ate everything but the chicken.  I let the server know just so they could prevent it from happening in the future.  She did the right thing by grabbing the manager however this female manager handled it in the worst way possible.  I made it very clear that I did not want a new one and just wanted to give them a heads up.  However, this lady started arguing with me saying that she ""knows her kitchen"" and that the chicken was not cold.  All I was trying to do was be polite and give them a heads up however this lady made my blood boil.  Makes no sense."
1368,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food, the portions are awesome.  The wait is kind of long and the service is decent"
1369,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was the best food I had the whole time that we were in Vegas. HUGE portions. I recommend you split your meal. And the wait staff was excellent. I sure wish we had one of these closer to my home!
And the BLT Bloody Mary is excellent. But a tad spicy (my BF said it was too spicey for him)."
1370,Hash House A Go Go,5,This was a great experience. I ordered the chicken and waffles while my friends had stuffed burgers gigantic pancakes bbblt and french toast and everything was amazballs. If you come to Las Vegas stop by the Linq and hit this place up. This is a must if you come to Vegas. Our waiter was Damon and dude had to be the best server EVER! Prices were around $15 for a plate and the portions were huge. This place needs to be on your bucket list definitely. Best eating experience i had in Vegas hands down. The wait may be long but once you get in it is more than worth it.
1371,Hash House A Go Go,5,"so good! 

my coworker suggested I come here and since we were going to a show at caesars palace we decided to check it out. the man and I ordered a cobb salad and chicken and waffles to share. the salad was gigantic and so good. the chicken and waffles were the best ever. i've been to roscoe's in socal and chicken and waffles in oakland, but i was a vegetarian until a few months ago so this was my first experience with the actual chicken with the waffles. it blew my mind, and whoever thought to put bacon inside the waffles is a genius. bacon rules. the chef came out and was talking to everyone and asking how the food was which was a nice touch and our waitress was attentive but not overly so. we figured that by ordering a salad we'd be able to finish off the chicken and waffles but we only got through 2/3 of the salad and had one chicken piece left and one waffle left. win!"
1372,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hungover much?
Hungry much?
Will eat anything as long as its edible?

If you answered 'YES' to any of the above, this place is the place for you. Its A WHOLE LOTTA food per person and has the hometown favorites - fried chicken, corned beef, scramblers - pretty much all the comfort foods you could think of. Although if you were to eat all of it, you would definitely not be so comfortable! 

The food is, to cut right to the chase, not very good. So if you're looking to just eat because you're hungry and would eat anything so long as its food - then go here. 

Its a good experience overall too - just go to see how much food a restaurant could possibly give you on one plate. In terms of portions, Hash House A Go Go has surely made quite a feat!"
1373,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was amazing, the food definitely exceeded our expectations and the waiter was welcoming and friendly. Over all a great experience. We will definitely be returning here"
1374,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Parking: Restaurant is located in Linq and I honestly have no idea where you would park to get here. I walked here from the strip so I didn't deal with the parking. 

Time and Day: Came on a Friday morning around 8:30 AM and there was a 20 minute wait. The line moved fast so I didn't have an issue getting a table.  

Food: My fiancÃ© and I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles ($19.99) and the Famous HH Smores Mocha ($8.99). Let me warn you now, the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles is massive. Both of us couldn't finish all the bacon waffles and we were both hungry. So with this warning, it is a lot of food and can easily split it between two people and three is you are not that hungry. Waiter/waitress won't mind if you ask for another plate to split. Anyways, the chicken was delicious but not as good as what everyone was saying. In a blind test, I wouldn't tell a big difference between the chicken here and say Popeye's fried chicken. As for the waffles, it is a unique twist. Each waffle has bacon inside so combine with the syrup, you get sweet bacon & waffles. I like the idea but I can't imagine myself consuming this every time. As for the HH Smores Mocha, the melted marshmallow mixed with the mocha was amazing. However, once you eat all the marshmallow, you get a regular boring chocolate mocha. I wish I can get more marshmallow. Over, the food gets a (3/5).

Service: Was not a good day to eat here because the service was incredibly slow. Our waiter apologized stating there was drama in the kitchen but it didn't stop me from being annoyed by it. It took 10 minutes to get menus and almost 15 minutes for water to come out. Food was noticeably taking a long time to come out and even though the waiter said our Smores Mocha would be coming out very soon, it didn't. It came after the entrÃ©e came and our entrÃ©e came almost 35 minutes later. Overall, service was slow and annoying. It is not the waiter's fault and I did appreciate his honesty with it. Service gets a (3/5). 

Price: The meal was large and can easily split with two people. The price justifies itself here.   
 
Overall: A decent breakfast place to eat on the strip considering that not many restaurants are open here. I do recommend people to come here to try their massive meals (better come hungry) but don't expect them to be savory delicious. Anyways, this place gets a (3/5) from me."
1375,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Without a second thought, I would have given them a 5-star, if not for the long wait time after ordering the food.

Unfortunately, like most breakfast places, you cannot make a reservation. So, you'll have to come in, write your name down and then wait! We stayed at the Quad and wanted to come here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. When called them from our room, they said the wait time was 30min. So we came down to write our names to get on the wait list. And when we did, the lady said that the wait time was going to be 45min. We waited.

Finally, our names were called and we took our hungry selves inside the restaurant. Here is what we ordered:
 - Coffee
 - Scrambles (Smoked chicken, sundried tomato pesto, spinach and goat cheese)
 - Waffle
 - Pancakes

We got the food 50 minutes after placing the order. So frustrating. But the meal turned out to be fantastic. The portion is big enough for 2 people to split. 6 of us split 3 dishes and we left the restaurant with a full stomach and a satisfied breakfast."
1376,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is great staff is friendly ginormous portions! Everything looks like what people post! Recommend you arrive early cuz you're going to wait but it's worth it
1377,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Greaaat experience here. My friends an I came to Dallas early Thursday morning and this was our first stop. We had a little trouble locating the restaurant but after speaking with someone from the LINQ hotel we located it. A table for 3 took about 5-10 minutes and then we were seated. Both my friend and I ordered the famous chicken and waffles while the 3rd friend ordered eggs, bacon, and potatoes. However, the waiter told me that the entree for chicken and waffles was big enough for 2 people. We took him up on that and I'll be damned, we couldn't even finish it with two people! The chicken was seasoned great, the waffles were amazing, and the customer service was superb! Only thing I didn't care for was the mimosas, more so because it wasn't strong for the amount of money we spent. I'd return!"
1378,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for breakfast after a night on the strip. We sat at the bar and found that the service was great. My husband and I decided to share the scramble with chicken, roasted red pepper, and corn. Without looking around, we decided to get an extra biscuit since my husband LOVES his biscuits. What a mistake that was. HUGE portions. The biscuits were as big as two of my fists together. Overall, best breakfast we've had on the strip. We're STILL raving about the breakfast scramble and plotting how we'll recreate it at home! Great coffee with fresh cream also. A little expensive, but perfect to share if you want to. Make sure to get there early - the line was outrageous when we left!"
1379,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Just came to this restaurant, excited to try it. My friend and I ordered the bacon waffle with eggs and the salmon sandwhich.  The portions were really big so we couldn't eat everything and only ate half of our foods. We asked the waiter for some boxes to go and as the waiter brought back my container there was a live baby roach that was moving all around in the container as I was about to put my waffle in there. 

I immediately called for the waiter to come over. This was unacceptable. I asked the waiter to bring over the manager and all she said was that we have exterminators that spray and that the only thing I can do is take half off your bill. She acted as if it was no big deal.

Why should I have to pay when I got a roach in my container. So disgusted and nasty. I will no longer be eating here."
1380,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Long wait but worth it! Cold brew woke me up and I added a nice shot of baileys ;) try it! I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with crispy hash browns instead of mashed potatoes. Drew took great care of our party of 5 and had us laughing while we struggled through our hungover morning! Portions are large, nice to split unless you want to take some home. Can't wait to come back and try one of everything else on the menu! Thanks for the great service Drew!"
1381,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What a great breakfast experience this place was. There was a bit of a wait but definitely worth it. 
We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. My husband and I shared it and couldn't finish it. Their portions are big. We also ordered the BLT bloody Mary's, they were delicious. You literally make yourself a BLT out of the bacon, tomato and lettuce from your drink and it's amazing!"
1382,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food and drinks! We had the bacon grilled cheese and a side of biscuits and gravy. Great flavor and the fries were spiced well. The bartender and the server were pleasant and the atmosphere was casual.  We got the watermelon lemonade and a baileys and coffee. I will definitely be back!
1383,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came here at about 1130 on a Monday morning and we were already hungry. We expected somewhat of a wait but we had to wait about 45 mins for just the two of us... on a Monday.. 

Also it took a while to get the food after ordering so either plan ahead or snack a little bit before you head here- you may wait a while before you eat.

Ok so the real review. This place has a funky name but let me say they do not mess around with food. It's a fun building with a wall of fame of people who ate here. Big waiting area with lots of seating which was nice. The staff are constantly busy but the hostess did a great job staying organized and they call your name over a speaker so you can hear when your table is ready. 

We sat down in a nice booth with plenty of room and were quickly greeted by our server. She seemed a little rushed but hey it's insanely busy so I understand. Drinks came quick but food took maybe 15 min, but felt like a lifetime. As I mentioned, we were very hungry so we ordered too much food!! The portions are no joke. One meal can easily be two meals. I got the chicken hash and my partner got the healthy boring thing, and we decided to split one blackberry pancake which turned out to be enough food for a family of 5. This pancake was unreal. My hash was good but I wasn't blown away. The pancake was surprisingly fluffy and tasty despite being ridiculously enormous. We were happy we came here and they have some really fun, over the top brunch items for a decent price but some of it may leave you feeling paralyzed. It's more about eating a giant meal and bang for buck than top quality ""5 star"" type breakfast. Definitely recommend checking it out."
1384,Hash House A Go Go,2,I felt gross after eating here. Portions are huge so if you go with a party of 5 all of you can share a plate. Rather have Quality food over quantity!!!
1385,Hash House A Go Go,5,"THE RESTAURANT IS IN THE LINQ HOTEL (formally The Quad Hotel)  and boy..... the food is no joke!!! Its pretty darn good!!! But make sure to bring your 3rd and even your 4th stomach because the portions are so huge that it can feed 3 kids or 2 avg size adults!

So my boyfriend ordered  the Andy's sage fried chicken with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs... which was the ""Man VS Food"" favorite...I was totally surprised that even my boyfriend couldnt finish it!  I ordered  the Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin with tomato, spinach, bbq cream and scrambled eggs.  I never realized that pork tenderloin could be so huge!!!  So good but I only ate a quarter of it 

Overall the waiter was great and polite.... only had a 10 min wait cuz we came around 8am...by the time we left the restaurant,  the waiting area was SO FULL!!!--- and mind ya it was a Monday morning!!! I would definitely come back...but ill make sure to share food with somone !"
1386,Hash House A Go Go,5,"All I gotta say are, portions are HUGE!! You better arrive hungry and be prepared to feel like you got a food baby in ya.  Their watermelon lemonade is to die for!"
1387,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This restaurant is amazing. Expect to do a little waiting because it was packed in the morning. However, the wait time was only 15 minutes for my group of 4 people. I ordered the waffles and they were great but the portion was so huge that I could only eat a quarter of my plate. My friends got the flapper jacks in the banana flavor and that was so good. It was a perfect balance of soft, crunchy and sweet. I would expect everything on this menu to be delicious and when I go back to vegas, I know I'll be coming back here again!"
1388,Hash House A Go Go,4,I like the flavor.  The portions are massive and that is the primary reason I don't go more often.  I assume they do that to make the price seem more reasonable.
1389,Hash House A Go Go,4,Wow! Large portions here! You don't have to eat lunch or dinner afterwards. We had the brown sugar banana pancake eggs bacon and farm Scrambles.  It was very tasty. The pancake was huge.  We had amazing service.
1390,Hash House A Go Go,5,Way more food than one person needs but totally great tasting food so you eat as much as you can.  Great service and very good food so go check it out.  The price is worth everything you get.  Be careful of the mimosas  because the large is REALLY large.
1391,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Since we were staying at Imperial Palace, why not eat at hash house since i have been wanting to try it. 

I had the sage chicken benedict. I knew their portions were huge but damn every dish that came out was MASSIVE. I actually was a huge heffer this weekend and I ate my whole plate (don't judge me). Everyone knows how big and artery clogging this could be but i ate every bit of it. I loved the everything the benedict came with, however i wished it came with poached eggs not fried egg. I love the drippy egg yolks, too bad it wasn't on this one. The biscuit and mashed potatoes were good. It did get very heavy and difficult to eat but with everything together a piece of egg, tomato, crispy bacon, and a piece of that juicy chicken made it more delicious.  The chicken wasn't too crispy because of the sauce but it was nice and juicy, not dry at all. I must say...those tomatoes are AMAZING. So sweet and juicy. If there was a whole one on my plate...i'd eat it like an apple. It was that good (I love tomatoes). 

We wanted to eat there again before we left but it was not possible. They need to open later on sundays too!! People are still hungry!


Service was great, the wait was about 30-40 mins but it really wasn't that bad, it went by fast. Just go down stairs to gamble a little to kill some time. 

-GO ! (a must go you might like it or you might not, but you should try)



P.S.: Share the plate. Everything is HUGE."
1392,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best breakfast we've had in Las Vegas...  great service no complaints the wife and I enjoyed the experience, food and service."
1393,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I wanted to really like this place... but it's way too touristy , too crowded and at not fault of the servers because of the crowds the overall service is lacking.  The food was good; but after waiting 40 minutes to be seated and another 40 minutes to eat it just wasn't worth it."
1394,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My husband and I were on vacation for our anniversary when we stopped here on our last morning in Vegas. Overall, it was a very good experience. It's a tad pricey but it's because the portions are HUGE. Don't come here unless you're super hungry. Our server's name was Drew and he was super nice, attentive, and friendly. Our coffee and food were both delicious. The only complaints I have are that the people who actually bring you your food are pretty rude and they also brought us the wrong food 3 times."
1395,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Too much hype?! I think so!

They don't take reservations. Sometimes, you need to wait for a hour or two to be seated, but they are open 24/7. Service is really either great or not. Some waiter go out of their way for you, others ignore you until you chase them down for the bill. Food is mediocre.

The FAMOUS sage fried chicken w/ waffle: The sage chicken is too hard and too bland. Sadly. A little salt and pepper can go a long way. The waffle was delicious, though. The best and only thing I loved on the menu.

Sage chicken salad - Same comment about the chicken. The salad was HUGE (like all their other dishes)! It was okay, but the ingredients can be a little more refined. There was no balance, just a heap of food put together on a plate. Fresh ingredients though.


Overall, it is decent for the portion and taste, but you can find better. It is very convenience, since it is open 24/7. Love waffles, Come here to try! However, if that doesn't float your boat, go elsewhere, when you have other choices."
1396,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing! you must experience the hash house at least once in your life. Went to vegas this weeked, i told my BF about this place and we ended up going twice because it was such a hit."
1397,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I loved this place. The servers are excellent and had no issues posing for photos. 
The food is top notch and the portions are huge. Consider sharing a plate or taking lots to go."
1398,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is the best!!  I eat here every Vegas trip.  The BBBLT is the best although a little smaller than my last trip, it is still large enough for at least 2 people.  Didn't get a chance to get the French Toast this time but it is always top of the line."
1399,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Lunch time! I had this place planned to come to my whole drive to Vegas. Came in for lunch and  wasn't disappointed. I ordered the pot pie which I've had before at another location and my husband ordered a scramble. Huge portions as expected and there was no way I was going to be able to finish the pot pie no matter how hard I tried. It was super flavorful and was super on point. There were so many veggies and chicken. We also tried the BLT bloody Mary and made it a double. Super tasty and had all the fixings. 

The server was super nice and attentive. We were seated quickly after arriving and everything flowed rather smoothly it took a little time to get the bloody Mary's out but we were okay once they did."
1400,Hash House A Go Go,4,Bit of a wait but worth it! The bloody mary's are super good- spicy and delish. I got the fried chicken n waffles- a big plate of yummy goodness.. The waffles even had pieces if bacon in them!
1401,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The atmosphere is cool but the wait is about 20-25 minutes for a party of 2. It is a Sunday night so that may be usually for a weekend. We may come back tomorrow when it is not so busy... We were seating in 16 minutes.I originally ordered a portabella mushroom sandwich with sweet potato fries but decided I would not be able to finish the dish. The waiter was profession and cancelled the order after it had come through. Order still came through but did not dissappoint. Overall it was a chill, hip, and trendy. Now we are waiting to taste this Yummy Sage Fried Chicken and Portabella Mushroom San which with Sweet Potatoe Fries."
1402,Hash House A Go Go,5,"SO GOOD, a must try. We stopped here for breakfast twice on our trip and we were only in town for 3.5 days! That should be an indication of how good this was.

Our first stop here, we ordered the Fried Chicken & Waffles, Fried Chicken Benny, and the Banana/Brown Sugar flapjacks. All were delicious, but our second stop here, we just got the Fried Chicken Benny's to share.

The sauce was just amazing, a little bit of spice and not too creamy. 

The dishes are a bit pricey, at around $18 per plate but the portions are gigantic here, even 2 people struggled to finish one plate. 

Service here was excellent as well. We were seating in the same section twice and had the same server. Attentive, friendly, informative.. 

Overall a great experience."
1403,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you are sick of buffet for brunch, or even for lunch/dinner, Hash House is a legit alternative!

Generally I go for the buffets on Sundays during my stays in Vegas but friends and I decided to try something different.  We all had Hash House in SD so decided to try out the Vegas strip location.

Two of us ended up getting the Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffles.  Yes it's as crazy as it sounds :]] Fried chicken and thick bacon waffles then topped with hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. Sage on the chicken gives it such a different flavor and what better way to start the day than with fried chicken??  Bacon waffles are filling and the little bits of bacon is a nice smoky touch from the sweetness of the waffles.  The maple reduction and fried leeks are good just by itself. I can drink a gallon of the maple reduction and just eat a salad made of fried leeks.

The other two went for the Sage fried chicken benedict. Fried... chicken... benedict!  It comes with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. What a healthy way to start the day huh?

Hash House's specialty is what it markets itself as: twisted farm food. It's nothing gourmet and definitely not the healthiest breakfast food around but it's fun, delicious, savory, and guaranteed you won't leave hungry!"
1404,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We visited here the first weekend in June 2017. Upon arriving we wanted to turn around because there were a lot of patrons waiting with no where to sit. We were told the wait time would be 45 minutes to 1 hour, however the wait was more like 20 minutes. I ended up getting the chicken and waffles. Let me just say that this is a huge meal and best if shared by two people. The waffles are stuffed with bacon. Overall the meal was pretty good but I would have liked my chicken breast fried a little more crispy! I had a wonderful virgin watermelon kiwi drink. After adding a packet of sugar it was good. I ended up getting the drink in the souvenir glass for $12.00. We visited around noon but next time we will visit after 5:00 pm so that we can try their homemade honey butter biscuits that are only served in the evenings. Whenever I am in Vegas I will visit again."
1405,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Oh the hype! The many celebrity endorsement pictures on the walls ! And then Oh The Fall :(.   I have never before had such dry and overcooked food! Really?! I mean, how could they release that plate of food to the table? I ordered the ""Salmon Scramble"" (the Salmon hash dish) & my Son ordered the ""Chicken scramble"".  BOTH dishes were dry, dry, dry and the potatoes were so overcooked they were almost black. Soooo disappointing! Food was also underseasoned. Our server was a nice fellow, transplanted from the east coast. I will not be returning to Hash House a Go Go.   A waste of a LOT of money."
1406,Hash House A Go Go,3,Got food poisoning from here!! Can't even say fried chicken and waffles without getting sick to my stomach!!! Ugh! Don't think I can return or recommend to any one else! At Least not their chicken :(
1407,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hey hash house! Yum. Went on a Sunday morning, so it was packed. There was a 40 min wait for a party of 4. Our server was excellent! He was very knowledge about the food, lattes, and gave us some pointers on the menu. The portions are huge. The food was fresh and flavorful. Good food and great service on the strip? Get outta here! We will be back."
1408,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Large portions which should be shared by 2.  I decided to try the heart healthy breakfast with scrambled whites and salmon but was disappointed in the taste.
The salmon was sweet tasting. Chunks of salmon scrambled with whites (looked more pale yellow) and a couple of slices orange and 3 slices cantaloupe.  
Hubby had scrambled eggs with bacon and it came with a huge amt. carb overload - lots of cottage fried chunks of potatoes which were good and a very large, dry biscuit. The biscuit was difficult to eat unless you put a lot of butter on it or smother it with jam.  They initially told us it would be a 30 min wait but the turn over is so quick, we were seated in about 10-15 mins. 

Considering there are not a lot of quality, affordable places for breakfast on the strip unless you go to McD's, the breakfast here is better than other chains."
1409,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Was in Vegas for just 1 night to get out and just hang out. And ended up going here to Hash House. 
Let's start out by saying that I ordered probably one of the best options on the menu which was the Fried Chicken and Waffles, which were sooooo good! 2 big ol' pieces of chicken and about 4 waffles piled up.My buddy ordered the 2nd most popular dish which is the eggs benedict which was a giant mountain. Now talking about portions let me move on to my first point portion size...now,  If you are all about going out to eat and LOVE to share with your significant other or just anyone in general, well this is the perfect place for that. The portion size is HUGE!!! And is hard for any 1 person to eat their whole plate in one sitting. I was sitting there eating for a while and looked like I barely made a dent in any of my dish.
Oh and they are also open 24/7, and so with only being there for the night we went there 2 times, Once at about 7:30 pm and then again at about 2 am and got food to go and went back up to our room.

I now see why this place has so many reviews and 4 stars! It was very worth it! The only no good thing is that the bathroom is not in the restaurant, it's down the escalator and around the corner in the Casino."
1410,Hash House A Go Go,5,"DELICIOUS!  missed the Man V Food episode, but followed a cousin's recommendation.  Service was great, wait was about 15 minutes for two of us, on a holiday Monday, around noon.  prices are very reasonable, portions are MASSIVE, and the ""Man V Food"" Chicken benedict is fantastic!"
1411,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place made me hash house a go go to the bathroom. Okay that may not even be true but I wanted to write it anyway.

Not a surprise that we stumbled in here at around 2am on a Friday. I was with a group of seven, though that really only counted in terms of bodies. There were about three functioning brains in total. Then a few girls came and joined us. One of them knew my brother. Somehow that made the functioning brain count go down one. Boom! Take that, girls that I don't know at all!

I ordered some eggs and they actually weren't that bad. They weren't that good, either. But again, 2am. So whatever.

Every single plate that came to the table had a piece of watermelon, a strawberry, and a giant sprig of rosemary. Every plate. Not sure why. The guy who orders things must have a connection with the guy who distributes those things.

Strawberries and watermelon are not in season (actually, does Las Vegas have a fruit season at all? can produce grow amidst despair?)

Rosemary...well that would have been fine, except that every indication on the menu suggested that it would be sage. Sage waffles. Sage chicken. Sage this, sage that.

But then it turns out it was all rosemaried instead.

Computers went down at 2:45. Computers came back up at 3:00. There is no bathroom in the whole restaurant. I think that is illegal in California. But we were not in California. We were in a hash house in Nevada."
1412,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must go restaurant. Food is amazing, large potion, probably few ppl can share one meal. Great service! Long line to wait, but worth. Price is very reasonable compare other restaurant in LA. Must Go"
1413,Hash House A Go Go,4,"What you must know: The prices are a little high, but they are justified by the portions! Skip the gluttony of the buffet and eat brunch here and you'll be fueled until late in the evening (just in time to charge your battery and go deep into the night with your Vegas fun).

The atmosphere is nice and casual. The drinks are amazing (BLT Bloody Mary anyone?). But the main attraction is the food. It was amazing for the portions and the price of it.

I had the chicken and waffles and it was epic. Just to put the awesomeness into perspective I offer you this: They bake the bacon right into the waffle. It's so good! 4 waffles, 2 chicken breasts, a crap-ton of calories and absolutely no remorse.

Go here. Enjoy a meal and you won't be dissapointed."
1414,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Took my brother and sister in law here to experience American food. We ordered stuffed burger, chicken waffle, and fried chicken Benedict. Each dish was served with huge portion of food and great taste! The presentation of food was also very impressive. We were all full by the time we walked out of HHAGG. It's definitely a great place for tourists and someone who loves burgers. :)"
1415,Hash House A Go Go,4,"two days in, this is my favorite thing about vegas.  portion size is an amazing value when sharing (but a waste if you're trying to go it alone w/o ""man vs food"" appetite).  the pancake is the size of a medium size pizza!  not that we ordered one, just an observation of the table next to us where the woman ate a mere 1/8 of the pie, i mean, pancake.  our table split 3 types of hash (salmon, meatloaf and roasted chicken), which were all tasty, but the real star was the fried chicken & waffles.  oh my goodness, that was heaven, even for someone like me who isn't really a fried chicken kinda gal.  but wow, so juicy and tasty!  and lord, the bacon INSIDE the waffle is pure genius!  i can safely say, i'm going back ... maybe every day that i'm here?"
1416,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Horrible food and horrible service. 

This was the first place I ate at when I arrived in Vegas this trip. It's located on the second floor across the entrance of the Linq. 

I came in a group of 3 and we ordered two dishes because we passed by a few tables and the portions were huge. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken pot pie. It also came with large biscuits with a honey, caramel, butterscotch sauce. The chicken and waffles were okay. The chicken was good and moist. The waffles were whatever. The chicken pot pie was a huge no-no. It wasn't even a pie. It was a hard piece of thick crust with a creamy potato, veggie, and chicken mix. It was sooooo bland and not chicken pot pie. 

Onto the service.. first off, it took forever for someone to greet us at our table. After our server dropped off our drinks, she walks away but we were ready to order. Uhhh? So we had to grab her attention. Second issue, we told her that the chicken pot pie was bland (we hardly touched it) and she goes ""You should've told me in the beginning, I bring it back to our manager"" and grabs the plate and takes it back to the kitchen. Excuse me, ""we should've told you in the beginning?"" Are we supposed to take a bite as soon as you drop it off and let you know if we don't like it there and then? My group and I are all servers and we'd NEVER say that to a customer. And our server NEVER came by to check on us and I had to flag her down to tell her about the dish. 

10-15 minutes after she takes away the dish, the manager comes by with the check and drops it off without say ANYTHING. They took off half the dish and on the receipt, it said ""ATE CHICKEN."" What does that mean? I ate all the meat and gave it back to you? I was so pissed off at that point and we left no tip. That other half of the dish that they should've taken off should've been your tip, but whatever."
1417,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions here are huge! I mean seriously really really big! The peanut butter banana pancakes are amazing. The pancake was literally the size of a medium pizza. We also had an avocado potato hash that was just okay. Apparently, the big menu item is the sage chicken and waffles, but I didn't try that. The waiter was really friendly and he checked up on us often. We had to wait about 30 minutes for our seat, but the wait time was exactly what they had quoted, so that was nice, plus it was brunch on a Sunday in Vegas, so it is to be expected. I would go back if visiting again."
1418,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Big Portions for the right prices. Great for breakfast and lunch hours. The one here at imperial isn't as packed as the one outside and off the strip on Sahara. I had the Andy sage fried chicken Benedict and it was huge! (what's she said..) Good enough to feed 1-3 person. But as for me, i killed it. They also have dinner menus too and a big drink menu to satisfy for needs."
1419,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions. Easily split between two people. Chicken Benedict with chipotle sauce is amazing. Biscuits and gravy are a good portion. Fresh pressed apple juice reminds me of cider but not quite as tart.
1420,Hash House A Go Go,5,An absolutely FABulous place to eat...any meal...any time...YUM...
1421,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I wish I had one of these in LA ! Everything was just amazing.  The service was great and it's not expensive at all.  Best of all, they put bacon inside the waffles !"
1422,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We went to Hash House on the recommendation of friends who had just gone to one outside of Vegas.  What a treat!

I got the Chicken and Waffles, which was gloriously yummy.  The chicken was fried with sage in the batter, which added a nice element.  The waffles were made with bacon in the middle, for a nice surprise when putting together a chicken/waffle/bacon bite.

We also tried one of their stuffed burgers, which was good (not great, this could have been influenced by our experience at Le Burger Brassiere with the $77 burger, see my other review). 

Both portions were huge, I don't know anyone who could finish a portion.  However, I can say that their drinks were wonderful.  They had a great Bloody Mary (nice and spicy) along with some special wine spritzer type drinks that were light and refreshing.

Our server was great, very attentive and efficient (even when the kitchen made a minor mistaked on our burger order)."
1423,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I've been twice... once because it's where my companions wanted to go and once because it was convenient. I'm not a fan myself, but if you're a fan of oversized portions and pretty standard American food, it's okay. Not horrible. The quality has been consistent the three times (correction... it was twice with family who wanted to go and once out of convenience) I've been. I'll give them that. For what they offer, the quality is consistent."
1424,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are gigantic, but then again so is the wait.  This place has gotten way too popular for its own good.  I took a place at the bar, and waited 15 minutes, until someone gave me a menu (which was apparently a foot away from me the whole time).  The wait staff is spread much too thin, and they're not able to cater to so many people at once.  The food was good, an interesting mix of continental cuisine with a fun twist.  I had the eggs Benedict with the fried chicken, and it was quite good.  I'm usually not a fan of chipotle sauce, but theirs was pretty good with just the right blend of spice and tang to it.  I would definitely go back again, but I would try to pick an ""off"" time, because breakfast was just much too packed for me to fully enjoy myself."
1425,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Headed here when another restaurant had a wait - was hesitant based on look of the place - but holy smokes this was AWESOME! 
Giant portions so make sure to share. Chicken and waffles, tenderloin, pot pie all great choices. Will go back on next Vegas trip!"
1426,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Perfect place to unleash my inner fat kid lol.

The ETA wait time was about 45 minutes for a group of five, but when we can back to check in after said 45 minutes, they had passed our name! The hostess was nice enough to put us back on our normal spot though, but fair warning that the wait is probably shorter than they say.

The portions are humongous, it's true. I ordered a benedict, and when it came out, I had no idea that it was mine. It looked like a monster! Probably because it was resting on a Mount Olympia model of mashed potatoes. Intimidation aside, it was yummy and hit the spot during an inebriated Vegas spell. I'm not sure how okay I would be eating it sober, but oh well lol. I even shared my dish with a friend and we both could barely finish it. Good place for a group, but make sure to come with empty stomachs and a hefty Vegas diet!"
1427,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is a must go eat!  It's in the old Imperial Palace hotel now known as the Quad. The portions are huge. I recommend sharing a dish.  My mom and I spilt the eggs benedict. It was absolutely scrumptious . The red cream sauce was magically delicious.  All the staff here was very friendly and our server Brie was pleasant and very attentive.
1428,Hash House A Go Go,5,HH is a great restaurant to try if you're in the Las Vegas area. Their pancakes are HUGE and delicious. I was not able to eat the whole thing lol. Their breakfast potatoes could use some work but nothing to take a star away. Drinks were amazing too. Recommend to everyone!
1429,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great dining experience.  I tried their infamous chicken and waffles, and it was pretty good. The next time I come I'll opt for a la carte, as I realized I'm not a huge fan of combing multiple foods in one dish. Here's how the food measured up:

Chicken- very tasty,  moist,  yet crispy.

Waffle - by itself great, but add the bacon and flavors from the chicken, I'll pass.

Bacon - not too crispy, not undercooked,  Perfect.

Coffee - great coffee! 

Eggs - too full to try, but they looked decent.

Portions- enormous! You get your monies worth.

Definitely worth a return visit. Very laxed environment and a huge crowd. The servers are courteous and attentive.  The system that they have in place gets the crowds in and out without making you feel rushed. We were told 35 min wait, but only waited about 20 min. Not bad!

Try it out! Hopefully your experience will be just as great."
1430,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Another overhyped restaurant. Portions are huge, yes, but almost half of each dish is filled up with filler items (a mountain of mashed potatoes, a bunch of mediocre waffles, etc).

Taste is average. We ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, meat loaf, bbq ribs and pot pie. They are SLIGHTLY better than Denny's but with superb presentation. Presentation is great on every dish, but taste is lacking.

All the hype must be from people who eat with their eyes and not with their mouth.

Decent, but overrated. In a place like Vegas, I wouldn't choose to eat here again."
1431,Hash House A Go Go,1,"THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW Of A RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENT.  I am moved to write this as I return home from a wonderful trip with friends. This restaurant came highly recommended. When we arrived there were DOZENS upon DOZENS of people crowding the pathway waiting in line to be seated. 

We were fortunate to find 3 seats at the counter, just not together. When we asked MANAGEMENT if an EMPTY stool could be moved so that a person in our 3 person party did not have to EAT STANDING, the reply was ""NO"". When asked why, the reply was ""it was their policy"". We further, respectfully asked if an exception could be made. The reply was ""IT WAS A HAZARD AND IN VIOLATION OF FIRE CODE"". I thought to my self, WOW, what about the DOZENS OF PEOPLE BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE AND CLEAR PATH IN AND OUT OF THE RESTAURANT, WHAT WOULD BE THE SCENARIO IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY. Are the dozens upon dozens of people crowding a clear path, not in ""violation"" of the ""fire code""?  Was it too much to ask for an EMPTY chair to be moved to a counter, where a patron who was ALLOWED to order a meal at the VERY SAME COUNTER, where he was EXPECTED to STAND UP TO EAT HIS MEAL, in violation of the same ""fire code?""

Rules are rules, ""I guess"".  Just so happens we were of the ""MINORITY"" persuasion. I ponder, how would that scenario have played out if ""circumstances"" were different. 

Food was great, service was friendly, sadly left a bad taste with respect to customer service, specifically MANAGEMENT."
1432,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the BEST breakfast brunch place I've ever been to. Everything on our plates were on point and beyond our wantings. There is no lacking in anything. Price is very reasonable. Great quality. Amount in plentiful, we love leftovers! They need to open one up in Oregon pretty please. The Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade was yummy, I ended up getting a to-go cup for it and walked around the strip with it. My House Smoked Salmon Benedict was so delicious! The Hash House Famous Meatloaf is to die for, absolutely amazing!!!"
1433,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Close to the airport and the Strip... and massive portions--what more could you ask for?  Located inside The Linq.
The sage chicken & waffles were amazing.  Husband and son consumed their entire plates of....some unusual but oh-so-original concoctions.  Everything is homemade and so original in thought.  Flavors are great.  Our server's knowledge of the menu was A+
4 stars and not 5 because there is a wait most times, they overhead page you for your table-meaning you have to stay nearby to hear it, the staff all seem hurried (probably due to the waiting customers,) and there was a whole lot of fluff on our plates that we didn't need (tomato slices...sage/rosemary sprig.)"
1434,Hash House A Go Go,4,Came here at the urging of several people. Not disappointed.  The servings were huge and the meal was amazing. Had the iconic chicken and waffles and they did not disappoint despite the unexpected appearance and flavors. Not to mention our waiter was  friendly and efficient.
1435,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Their chicken benedict or whatever it is called (the one on the menu that was in Man Vs Food) is HUGE!!! No wonder it was on that tv show. The portions for this restaurant are huge! The prices are very fair and the food is delicious. The chicken benedict is basically all of my favorite breakfast foods combined on one plate. Delicious!

EVERYONE splits this dish. it's so huge that there is no way one person could finish it. The location of the restaurant is ehhh. This one is in Imperial Palace casino.. which seems old and dirty. But I didn't care, the food was plentiful and delicious. Would go back again."
1436,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I warn you now, one plate can feed 5. My party of three, including me, ordered 3 sep plates, and had leftovers enough to feed all of Vegas. Seriously. We came after a pool party, and our eyes were hungry. We even ordered a side of mac and cheese WITH BACON. Can you imagine how we felt afterwards? Aside from how huge the portions are, the food itself is SO SO SO fricken delicious. I had this once before, and since then I was craving it until the next time I came back (which was during the labor day weekend). We ordered the mac and cheese, sage penne pasta, sage chicken and waffles, and chicken fried steak. Yes, it was all chicken, and pretty much all the same type of fried chicken. Each dish had it's own distinct taste and preparation, but damn were they all good. My favorite, of course, was the chicken and waffles. The crispy chicken and mouth watering waffle topped with maple syrup makes my tummy oh so very happy. They are opened 24/7, so go grab a bite when you're in town!"
1437,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Decided to come because of a restaurant.com coupon and the good reviews that this place has. It took a bit of effort to find and get to this place, I wouldn't think that a decent restaurant would be here in the imperial palace casino but it was pretty good. The staff raved about the sage chicken Benedict... Nice presentation, creative idea (not health conscious stuff). Wouldn't order it again personally but it was a fun experience the first time. Also ordered a side of hash browns extra crispy. They're not really hashbrowns but fried one inch potato cubes. Pretty good actually, especially when the potato skin is fried and flakes off, love that. 

Huge portions! If this place is convenient to get to and you want comfort food, just be warned, it's pretty greasy stuff!"
1438,Hash House A Go Go,3,Wait was normal 10-15 mins. Checked the menu out while waiting. Sat down ordered our drinks and put our food order in. Food took 45 mins to come out. When your food takes that long and your starving. You just want to eat and go. Food was decent. Portions were a good size. I'll give them that. I ordered a class of OG and glass of ice. So I put my ice in the OG. Then the server passes by and puts water in my glass of ice. I told myself that was glass of ice. My water is in the cup you gave to me earlier wow!!
1439,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It is in the IP Hotel, however, it was a great meal!  There were three of us and we ordered 1 appetizer and 2 entrees.  A salad that I can't remember and the Quesedilla and the Pork Sandwich. Both were amazing!  We saw the Chicken and Waffels come by a few times and it looked awesome. Second time there just 2 of us ordered the bone-in Rib-eye, Oh Yumm!   Everyone we spoke to loved it!  Had a marvelous experience both times we ate there.  Surprisingly wonderful experience!  Enjoy!"
1440,Hash House A Go Go,3,"OMG never again.

The service here is friendly and quick. I also noticed that they don't write any orders down at all.

They have a wide selection to choose from. They give so much food here, it's ridiculous. You are bound to not finish everything in one seating and it's a best to share, unless your a beast like that.

After a night of drinking and being hung over... and after eating here, I couldn't feel any worse. It felt like I was going to have a heart attack haha."
1441,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy crap huge portions.
Biscuits and gravy were tasty.  Biscuits are a bit dry.  More a baking powder type.
Gravy had great flavor.
Eggs were done to perfection.

Its a bit pricey for a Vegas Breakfast but worth it.

Waiters all seem to be guys.  Very friendly, very attentive and working hard.
Gave us good recommendations.

If your on the strip looking for a good breakfast its worth the trip.

Place is a bit loud, lots of people and the decor has metal table tops and metal panels
on the wall so that makes it loud.

We'll be back."
1442,Hash House A Go Go,2,Tourist talk!  The website is a bit deceiving. ..the location and menus are not coordinated . I checked in advance for favorite or palatable items only to arrive and the item chosen was in San Diego not Las Vegas.   A very festive atmosphere and lively service. The food is served in large portions so one can definitely get a bang for the buck. Not extraordinary but not flat either.  Okay we have experienced   hash a gogo we will leave this in Vegas.
1443,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions deserve 4 stars so go hungry. The best real corned beef hash I've had. Nice ambiance and good for kids. Good food at reasonable prices. Will return next time we're in Vegas.
1444,Hash House A Go Go,4,Gargantuan portions!  Chicken and waffles are to die for. Pair that with their bloody marys and I'm over the moon.  The only time I haven't waited to sit at a table was arriving at 7 AM after an epic night out which made the giant portions of food even tastier as you can imagine.
1445,Hash House A Go Go,4,Really like this place. Good food and nice atmosphere. It's a good fit for this hotel (LINQ).
1446,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If it pleased my Dad who's a cook, it deserves a 5 star."
1447,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great place to grab breakfast 24/7!  Good portions and reasonable prices.  Service is great as well.
1448,Hash House A Go Go,1,"As a response to the comment by the manager below: No, they did not have a reservation. We were sitting relatively close to the front stand and were able to hear everything. Also, it was 02:00 am. The host was clearly aware of his mistake and tried to play it off. There's no excuse."
1449,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always busy...for a reason. This place is amazing. The food is top notch. Never disappoints. The bill was less than what we paid at Dicks Last Resort, which is hands down the worst excuse for a restaurant on the planet,  but Hash House is amazing and I'll gladly wait two hours in line for their food...yes, it's that good."
1450,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food! Always a wait. No reservations the day of. Service can be slow when they are super busy.
1451,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food was amazing and so were the staff. Definitely a great place to visit while in Vegas!
1452,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place was great! It was busy and the wait did not disappoint. The serving sizes are HUGE! Both my husband and I brought half of our plates back to our hotel. My husband loved the pancakes and I enjoyed my fried chicken benedict.
1453,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I did a search on Yelp last week about the best breakfast in Vegas and this place came up. Since it was located next door to my hotel we were eager to try it. 

Thursday morning - line out the door, so we skipped it
Saturday morning - line down the stairs, so we skipped it
Monday morning - line out the door, but decided to stay.  The line moved surprisingly quick. 

There were 4 of us at the table and the server was really great. I asked her what she recommended and she went through some things and gave great input. She even suggested that each couple could split a meal and there would be plenty of food to spare. 

But being the gluttons we are, we wanted to try many things so we each ordered something different. What ensued was maybe the best breakfast I've ever had. Everybody loved everything and there was indeed too much food, but it was worth it. 

I also feel it's one of the finer values on the Strip as far as cost. ~$15pp for the best breakfast you're likely to ever have is a bargain."
1454,Hash House A Go Go,1,"i was really excited to go eat at this because I've heard so many good things, but i shouldn't always believe what people tell me. First of all the service was horrible. My server was this guy named jeff and i dont know what his problem was. He gave my food to the wrong person so i had to wait even longer on a day that was super busy. Another server had to help because that guy Jeff was of no service. I ordered the chicken which was my first time ordering chicken and waffles and it was nasty. My chicken was dry and i had to drench it in syrup. I was really disappointed."
1455,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The menu at Hash House is the stuff of which dreams are made.  I don't know what kind of crack Grandma Hash House puts in her recipes, but I'll happily exchange my 401k for a pound of it. Everything from the hot cakes to the salads ooze with pure glee and weight gain, and it hurts so good.    

On this particular trip to my favorite Vegas beacon of breakfast, our trio ordered a mix of Snickers and Pumpkin hot cakes, assorted breakfast meats and eggs; and, as the obligatory buzz kill of the group, I ordered the egg white omelet with fruit.  The wait times at the Linq location can be lengthy, but it's worth it.  Bring your appetite and your patience, and you'll leave a happy, bloated, camper for sure."
1456,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We were in Vegas a month ago and stayed at the Rio. Hash House A Go Go is a Rio restaurant so it was just out of convenience that we came here for breakfast before heading home. The restaurant has a farm decor to it which I thought meant it would have a lot of potential, but like everything else in Vegas, it's just for show. We each ordered the veggie hash which came with a biscuit. When the skillet came out I was instantly disappointed. None of the vegetables looked fully cooked in there and it wasn't even a proper hash...all of the ingredients were just thrown in there and it was lukewarm to the taste (meaning it wasn't even cooked in the skillet...again, just for show). The biscuit looked appetizing but was very dense and lacked flavor. I uncomfortably picked at my ""hash"" and finally gave up and threw most of it away. Despite the terrible foÃ´d, the service was excellent. Servers were enthusiastic and attentive. But since I almost always review solely on food, I have to give this place 1 star because it was just that awful."
1457,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wanted to go to Bacchanal, but couldn't wait 2 hours in line so hubby suggested we go here.

I am glad we ate here.  Like many of the review stated, the portions are HUGE!!!!  
The food is pretty good consider it is located in the Quad hotel. 

Everything we had were great!  We will go back and try the chicken & waffle next time when we are in town!"
1458,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The chicken and waffles are so bland it's pathetic. I don't even care for much salt, but come on! There is NO seasoning on the chicken, at all, whatsoever. Real chicken and waffles should have a contrast of flavor - a bit of sweet, salty, and a hint of spicy. Not here. The waffles are okay but the chicken gets an F. You will find more flavor in a 4 piece order of McNuggets - and I hate McNuggets."
1459,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMGGGG Hash House A Go Go Amazing!!!


 Hash House A Go Go inside the Linq Hotel 

Cost: Very reasonable. You're getting your money's worth. Believe me 
 
Seating: Inside was very big, very spacious. Inside you can smell all the deliciousness. A+++

Customer Service: Excellent A++++! The young lady Kayla took my order, gave us a great recommendations,check up on us in timely manner and was very professional and nice. !

Food: Brunch The Food deserves and A+++++ I ordered the sage chicken and waffle...OMGGGG  this was so big and delicious. It was so much, I had to take that baby home.Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is $14.95 the fried chicken was hot, seasoned right, cripsy, juicy!! The waffles and cooked bacon inside it.. Yes I said it. Cooked bacon inside it that was super delicious and flavorful. The waffles was golden brown and squared. The waffles taste like Heaven in my mouth. You can taste party in every bite. Definitely you need tons of syrup for the waffles and the chicken because the waffles can soak it up in matter of seconds.

Parking: Took a Uber (wink)

Overall Grade: I give Hash House A Go Go an  A+++++
5 Stars I definitely recommend coming on a day for Breakfast and Brunch. It's worth the wait. The Food was delicious. More selections and amazing food. The staff was very nice, friendly, and very welcoming. Definitely I will be coming back when I return to Vegas."
1460,Hash House A Go Go,5,We have loved everything we've ordered here! From the yummy cocktails to the chicken and waffles to the hash and biscuits and gravy. You get a ton of food and every bite is full of flavor. There is always a minimum of an hour wait... but it is totally worth it.
1461,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Awesome food, bring your appetite!! The chicken waffles were to die for... Easily feeds two!"
1462,Hash House A Go Go,1,"""High end "" breakfast/brunch spot.  Fake maple syrup.  Instant single star.  You wanna run a greasy spoon, fine.   Gonna charge $21 for breakfast?  Have real ingredients, not sweetened chemicals.  Even an up charge of $1-3 would be fine.  But poorly pretending to be high end?  Nope."
1463,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Stopped here for lunch after a morning of drinking (yah I know but it's Vegas right?) and was glad to be seated after only a 5 minute wait.  We were kept entertained by all the photos of celebrities who've visited, so it wasn't too bad.

Disclaimer:  The dishes here are definitely meant to be shared by at least two people.  There's so much food on the plate, that out of 11 hungry guys, only 1 was able to make it past the halfway mark (and that's because he got a sandwich).  That cornmeal breaded salmon sandwich did look might good.  The fries were crispy and well seasoned.  Not even my crazy friend, who usually eats like a mountain beast, could conquer his crispy hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict.  This piece of pork was freakin huge and was about the size of the plate.  Biscuits and gooey goodness underneath, it was really good.  I also tried some of the gigantic chicken pot pie and that was also really good.  I ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken: fried chicken, fried cheese, thick crispy bacon, chipotle sauce, all over biscuits and more... just damn delicious!  Another friend also got the fried chicken over bacon waffles, which was also tasty.  But everything tastes better with bacon.  Fact.  They also had a vegetable hash skillet, which our vegetarian friend really enjoyed.

The meal started off great, shoveling good food into our faces, but by the end we felt like sick pigs.  It was funny to watch my friend's agonizing face, while he kept taking ""one more bite""."
1464,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is DELICIOUS! they're smart for being open 24/7 in Vegas. We went after the club at 4am lol. For being that early in the am it was kind of busy. But we got served pretty fast. The food was amazing! We got the truck driver pancake and split it bc it was ginormous.  Affordable. Great service. Great for breakfast! They drinks are pretty delicious & unique as well. Good place for kids too.
1465,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Tried the Pork Tenderloin thinking its might be a healthier alternative with spinach, tomato. Not a chance pork tenderloin was breaded and laying on a huge mound of potatoes. Huge portions! $27.00 should be a meal for two. Sorry that i missed Sushi happy hour at Flamingo as is my stomach."
1466,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great service and conveniently on the strip. They give you huge portions and are very reasonably priced. The chorizo hash is one of my favorites as well as their Bloody Mary's. The vanilla waffle is really good, too."
1467,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Such great service. Tawney took care of us today and definitely made the visit more enjoyable. Of course, the food was amazing as well. 

I ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwhich not knowing what to expect but it was amazing. Perfectly grilled and the fries were crispy and paired with a great spicy aioli. Definitely coming back to this location in the future."
1468,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It's just that good.  Sure ""The Quad"" / ""Imperial Palace"" is a craphole, but you have to look past it.  The fact that my friend barfed on the casino floor on his way to the bathroom, well....that's just icing in the cake!  It sure wasn't a reflection on the delicious food."
1469,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We went to eat here twice during our visit to Vegas.  This is the only sit down restaurant in Quad Casino.  It was very busy both times we went.  The first time, we had the chicken and waffles.  This dish is as wonderful as everyone says.  It is full of bacon!  As in, bacon between the chicken and the waffles and bacon strips IN the waffles.  Hell gyeah!  The chicken was tender and crispy, but I wasn't a huge fan of the rosemary flavoring.  I didn't hate it though.  4 stars for sure.  

The second time, I just had a standard breakfast of ham, eggs, potatoes, and toast.  Nothing special there.  I do like how they throw some fresh fruit on the plate though. 

This place is tucked deep inside the casino, so there is no natural light anywhere to be found.  So, it's kinda dark in there.  Me no likely.  

Service was stellar both times I went.  I would definitely go back.  Portions are huge!"
1470,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Nice breakfast before we headed out. Short wait, only 15 mins, and we were served quickly. Holy crap the portions are huge! I ordered the man vs food special, a fried chicken benedict, and it can easily feed two people. The chicken was excellent and overall I had an amazing time."
1471,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First time in Vegas, had to try this place. Food was fresh and amazing! Their fried chicken is to die for, a must try!! This place serves big portions, the 4 of us ordered 2 dishes. It was more than enough."
1472,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Soooooo good, the wait was extremely long (1.5 hrs) but it was definitely worth the wait. I had the french toast and the portion was huge!!! As a matter of fact, that was the only meal I ate the entire day!!! The service was great and very fast which was appreciated since we were very hungry. I would make this a stop anytime I am in Vegas!"
1473,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Its reputation is well earned. I had a massive corned beef hash, with poached eggs, seasoned potatoes, Swiss cheese and a Smores cappuccino. 

This was real, shredded corned beef, not the chopped canned stuff going on the buffets of the strip. 

The Smores cappuccino is a diabetic coma in a cup! I couldn't finish it, but it was pretty amazing!

Lineups build quickly, so expect to wait a while before hearing your name called on the cheap boom box near the hostess station. Service was a bit slow, but based on the crowd, not surprising."
1474,Hash House A Go Go,5,I love this place! Dined in with a friend for dinner and were seated right away. The staff were so friendly. Food was great and the portions are massive for the price! My friend and I ordered margaritas and boy do they make a mean margarita! Great way to start the night. Will definitely return... this restaurant did not disappoint!
1475,Hash House A Go Go,5,So good!! Not one bad bite of food on the menu!!! I will definitely be back when I come back to town!
1476,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is definitely a great place to come check out if you're extremely hungry,  man are there servings huge. Each item is certainly meant for it to be shared. We made the mistake on our first visit, and everyone ordered there own individual item. The unfortunate thing about taking left overs back to your room, chances are you aren't going to eat them if you're in vacation. Nonetheless the food was good, and we all shared and tried out a variety of foods, from there chicken and waffles, the stuffed burger #2, Andy sage fried chicken and the Texas ranchero, all were great, but the one that definitely stood out in flavor was the Texas ranchero. Man vs food choice is the sage fried chicken, and that's great as well. Wait time was 30 minutes, but once you're seated service is immediately with the server, food does tend to be a little slower, understandably so as the dining room is pretty large and there's not an empty seat in the house. So once you arrive and put your name on the wait list it'll be about an hour before you take your first bite, but when you do, you won't be disappointed and you won't leave hungry. The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the linq hotel."
1477,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Long wait at 1pm was offset by the fantastic bloody marys! Olives were super tasty. Once we were seated, we were able to order about 10 minutes later. Out came huge portions about 4 times the size of your stomach.  We ordered the roasted chicken hash and the corned beef hash. We both did not really enjoy the hash, my chicken was fatty and a bit dry. The biscuit was amazing though!  That's all I ate and ordered a side of sausage gravy to go with it. Do yourself a favor and order the fried chicken, it looked awesome, and get biscuits with gravy!"
1478,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yesterday breakfast was exquisite. THANK YOU Hash House A Go Go. . . .

Walking toward the hostess I noticed There was a wait which usually means the food is great. Only a 5 minute wait.  I was very pleased and excited because I could see a bar. Most breakfast places forget about us alcoholics. Haha. 
My date ordered me The BLT Bloody Mary. I was very impressed. It was delivered quickly and tasted delicious. I was quite pleased with the appearance as well. Bacon, lettuce, tomato served in the glass and toast on the side.  
I will definitely be dining there again."
1479,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It doesn't get any better than this!! After doing extensive research on where to eat in Vegas, everyone kept talking about this place. So I decided to go with my sister for breakfast. 

The reviews don't lie!! The portions are HUGE. 2/3 times we ate there we just shared a plate of food lol . The pancakes are amazing! The biscuits are crazy huge! And everything taste amazing. 

If you go, please be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes for your table and anther 20-35 minutes for your food but it's worth the wait. And the prices are reasonable."
1480,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food here is always amazing. And overwhelming.  I've been here before but this is the first time I've had a banana pancake... all to myself.  Eating one of these is like having dessert for breakfast.

There are a couple tricks to eating here: 
1. Go early.  Drag your still-drunk butt out of bed!  If you go before 9 there will not be much of a wait.  Go afterwards and you could wait longer than an hour.
2. Skip the mimosa.  Fresh squeezed juice is so much better without 2nd rate booze.
3. Stick with the basics.  Their Tractordriver special or the Chicken and Waffles are awesome.  Most of the rest seems overly heavy.
4. Get a to go bag.  Don't worry about fitting it in your minibar, just give it to one of the nice homeless vets hanging out on the strip.  You'll keep the food out of the landfill and feel better about helping someone in need.

And last but not least...

5. GO HUNGRY."
1481,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here based on a recommendation from a friend and the Yelp reviews.    I ate at the Linq Casino location and made reservations ahead of time so I didn't have a wait.  Of course I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and was not disappointed.  We also ordered the Strawberry Lemonade and fries.  I didn't care for the lemonade but the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was amazeballs and by far the best fries anywhere.  The chicken benny was a crazy concoction of biscuits, fried chicken, scrambled eggs (which were not a good addition), melted cheese, tomatoes, some spinach thrown in for good measure and a spicy (not hot, just a nice warmth) Benedict sauce.  My chicken was a tad overcooked so it was a bit like jerky on parts of it.  

Ok so my biggest issue with this place was my server.  He was great and very attentive, but he was a complete meth head.  Obviously he had been up too many days because we could not even understand the words coming out of his mouth and his eyes were darting all over the place.  My 11 year old was like ""what's wrong with this guy"".  It was completely obvious he was on drugs so I'm not sure WHY they let the guy stay for his shift, they were not even that busy.  I opted not to talk to management because my daughter was with me and the guy seemed nice."
1482,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had brunch at Hash House A Go Go, and based on reviews expected more. The restaurant has a novel menu with larger than life portions however, the food was simply ok."
1483,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent!
1484,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The final food spot on this Vegas leg was Hash House. This place was packed, so we decided to bar at the bar. The bartender was full of energy and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the bacon stuffed waffle and the sage fried chicken Benedict. Let me tell you, it was a ton of food. The Benedict by itself was enough for two people, but when you add the waffle it turns into a ""You will be Full as hell experience"".  

Good experience and I would definitely be returning!"
1485,Hash House A Go Go,4,"OMG.....PORTION ALERT, wear stretchy pants folks!!!!!

We were there on the morning of January 6th, I had the ""Man vs Food"" recommendation. 
Portion control is not a consideration here, value for the money is most definitely alive a well here. Our server ""Sarah"" was a real pleasure, very knowledgable and not afraid to make a recommendation, in short, she nailed it. 

Food was great despite knowing it would not get finished! Quick service and well presented.....thanks to everyone there."
1486,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is one of those places you need to know before going to Vegas and I'm unhappy that I've found out about it only on my 3rd Vegas visit in the last 3 years!

It's open 24/7 which is great since in my opinion most of the Las Vegas restaurants tend to close down way too early. The portions are just immense and it's not easy to finish them all even with a good appetite.

Go there for breakfast and you might not even need to eat before dinner time.

Obviously the food is also good!"
1487,Hash House A Go Go,5,After a long night out in Vegas this is the place to go. The portion sizes are insane and the quality of the food is far from average. I went with a large group of people per my cousins recommendation & we all left satisfied & in food comas LOL.... nuff said.
1488,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions. Home made dishes made to order. Fresh squeezed juices. Awesome servers with awesome hair (yes, his hair made our experience fun ). This is the summary of my visit. This place is opened 24 hours a day seven days a week. It's inside the Linq hotel. You need to go thru the casino and take the escalators up to the restaurant. The bathrooms are not on the floor of the restaurant. You have to go down the escalators and turn right to get to the bathrooms in front of the purple zebra. 

Any ways. This place is busy. So come with an appetite. The portions are huge. Don't freak out from the large numbers of people waiting. The restaurant is very quick about seating people very efficiently and we only waited 10-15 minutes. It was great

Our server was Travis. He was awesome!! You can't miss him. He has a sort of Mohawk. It is awesome as well. Plus he was a great server and all his recommendations were SPOT ON.  Our coffee and water were refilled well. Our needs were fulfilled! 

My meal was the breakfast quesadilla with eggs potatoes and fresh jalapeÃ±os chopped. It's spicy and delicious especially with the sricha  chile sauce on top. My husband loved his meal too. We didn't finish our food. Not even half. Keep that in mind! 

The smores mocha was great. The best part was the marshmallows torched and the graham crackers. The drink itself  was very sweet. 

Fresh squeezed tangerine juice was unique and very refreshing. 

Overall, we had a great experience and recommend you come here at least once to this location."
1489,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Located in The Linq Hotel Casino on the famous Las Vegas Strip. Let me start with this, I am a huge Hash House A Go-Go fan, that is the other locations, the Plaza, Sahara. The service here was not so great. The presentation was subpar compared to the other locations, also I am pretty sure there was no vodka in my BLT Bloody Mary. This attitude that just because ""they are on the strip, they don't need to try"", is B.S. they need to take a lesson from their other locations and fast. If you want Hash House go downtown to the Plaza, it's so much better. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"
1490,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place for a casual calorie OD. Huge portions, friendly service, best fries. The peach iced tea is great."
1491,Hash House A Go Go,5,A must go.... I eat here everything I'm in vegas.... The bar is your best option... I love the guy with dark hair ponytail.. Drinks are on point.. The portions are shareable... I wish they would upgrade place ... I'm never disappointed at hash house last vegas
1492,Hash House A Go Go,5,"7 stars.  What the hell is wrong with some of you?

11:30AM on a 105-degree August Wednesday.  Line out the door.  That can't be a bad sign.

Wife got S'mores mocha to start.  It was a big hit.

Friend's wife got kiwi watermelon lemonade.  Interesting stuff, she raved over it.  

I got the sage fried chicken eggs benedict biscuit.  That was an enormous amount of stomach-orgasming food.  What a taste mix- juicy, crunch fried chicken, fully biscuit, awesome chipotle sauce (could have used a bit more, though) and mashed potatoes.  And I polished off every bit of it (no bullshit.)  

Wife got the banana pancake and holy Buddha on a stick, that was some incredible stuff.  A crunchy layer on top, about a foot across in diameter... and I got to eat about half of it (on top of my biscuit.  Yes, I am indeed the man.  Of course, I didn't want to eat for the rest of the day, but stop for a minute and give me some applause.)

Friend's chicken and waffles were fantastic, and everyone else raved over his wife's biscuits and gravy (which were so damned big, over half remained after her attempt and hubby's to eat it.)  Personally I thought the sausage was a little weak in it, but it was tasty.

I must thank the fine purveyors of this food not only for the insanely good quality and Godzilla-like proportions, but the fact that prices are just a couple of bucks higher than some casino coffee shop for a breakfast with 75% less volume and flavor is a real testament to the fact that they want you to enjoy the shit out of your meal.

Vegas, we have a clear winner for breakfast.  I am sold like crazy and will be visiting here each and every time we return."
1493,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is so awesome! The food is spectacular! Fresh, inventive, delicious comfort food and ginormous portions! Seriously though, share something. The Benedict is unbelievable! The pancake is the size of a hubcap and is so good. The chicken pot pie is also amazing and The coffee is very good too. We ate here three times in one week! Yes, it's that good."
1494,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Honestly I had never been to Hash House A Go Go before. After trying I can say that this is a good choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The portions were huge, the quality and the taste of the food  were fantastic and the prices were reasonable for what you receive. Only thing is the service was a bit slow as they were very busy.  
I had roasted chicken salad sandwich. It came with cucumber, bacon, yellow tomato and spinach on milk bread. And Hash House salad with creamy cucumber dressing and fresh radish. Not bad... The only bad thing was that the place was very noisy and it makes a little uncomfortable to have your meal. 
Overall: good place with tasty food. Will come back again but maybe will choose not very packed hours."
1495,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I AM IN LOVE! this place has humungous portions, and our group of five, got four entrees and shared, but we still had leftovers! I originally wanted to try the sage fried chicken eggs benedict, but i was the size of the plate, and was immediately intimidated. I opted for the sausage gravy and biscuits, which came over a bed of mashed potatoes and some fruit. LOVED IT! The Beau had the corned beef hash, which was also really good. my twin sister had the Chicken and waffles, and WOW! The size of that dish! Her BF went for the omelette with salmon(? not sure of the name), but that was also delicious and more on the healthier side. Definitely worth the wait. Must Go, and Must try!

also, our server billy was GREAT! exceptional all around!"
1496,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portions are HUGE! me & my friends went after we were done shopping, so of course by then we were STARVING. one of the girls heard about this place & said we HAVE to try it. So we went & when the meal came out we were like HOLLY CRAP! ITS HUGE! we should have known, since when we sat down the utensils were pretty much the size of my face. So by the end of our meal each of us ended up taking a to go bag, & we all had something to eat after the club that night. :] & yes the meal was still goood. OH make sure when they ask you which side you want i think its the pesto potato? not sure, but yeah ask for that, that was DELICIOUS!"
1497,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So bring warm clothes like a jacket, scarf, hat as it if Arctic freezing and there is a definite wind blowing.  The hostess was not very inviting as she didn't even acknowledge us and ask how many in our party apparently she is telepathic.  When we were lead to our table she glared at us and cleared her throat for us to follow.  We were promptly  greeted by our server Keith and drinks arrived quickly.  The menu has a wide selection of what they call fractured farm.  The portions are large and really 2 people can eat one meal.  The watermelon was extremely tasty! The biscuits and preserves are fresh made and are to die for.  I had a scramble which was very delicious but could have been a little warmer but could have gotten cold from the Arctic blast on he walk from the kitchen to the table.  Keith our server was very attentive and fresh drinks were offered up and he made sure we were satisfied!  I would give the hostess 1 star and the meal and Keith a 4."
1498,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We have made this into one of those places we *HAVE* to go to, if we're within 200 miles of it. WOWOWOWOWOW was the food good here! I got my wife addicted to coffee here (lolol) and I was very happy with the experience. I'll TOTALLY come back here, and recommend EVERYONE who goes to 'Vegas to go here too!"
1499,Hash House A Go Go,4,"What is there to say about HAGG that hasn't already been said. 
big portions, reasonably priced, wonderfully arranged, Bags-o-bud, Etc.

what surprised me most about this place is that they didn't have beds or at least a futon for a nap after your done. I think i even saw The Luther Burger on the menu...."
1500,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place serves heart attack on a plate.  And hope you don't drink your water too quickly because service is nonexistent at this place.

Surprisingly the food is good at this joint.  Upstairs in the Quad Hotel (do not ever stay here, horrible rooms), this place serves the famous fried chicken benedict.  I can't even believe how massive this plate is.  I asked for it without bacon since I can't eat pork.  The meal itself tastes amazing (for those rare indulgences I do with fried food).  The chicken was succulent, the scrambled eggs and cheese were hot and delicious, the mash potatoes were good, the biscuit was a little dry.  Love the chipotle cream, not too heavy, I asked for it on the side.  I like that they add tomatoes and some greens in there so you get a little bit of veggies.  

My sweetie had the corned beef hash.  I thought it was too greasy and the corned beef was too chewy.  It comes in a large griddle.  My God, we could have easily shared one dish.

I'd say this is great for hangover breakfast spot.  I am disappointed our waitress never checked on us ONCE the entire visit.  

Food 4 stars
Service 2 stars

I think my waistline and arteries are protesting after this Vegas trip."
1501,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I got food poisoning from this restaurant. The food seemed tolerable at first. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband the chicken pot pie. He didn't enjoy his plate so I told the waitress to take away, she did not offer a substitute nor a portion of his meal discounted. Regardless I didn't put up a fight. Both my husband and I ate my plate. The hours following consumption were horrible, we both broke in sweat, threw up everything we ate and couldn't enjoy our vacation."
1502,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fast, friendly service!  Started with a bloody mary...delicious.  The scramble and grilled mashed potatoes were to die for, and the biscuit with butter and homemade strawberry jam was delicious.  Friendly wait staff, quick and attentive service.  Loved it!"
1503,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Definitely with a visit when you hit Vegas!  You can spend the same at other places and be left flat.  Portions are huge, and it's nice to have a cocktail with your breakfast when in LV!"
1504,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is soooo awesome!!!!! I come here every time I come to Vegas. Trust me you will not be disappointed
1505,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait is almost always long to get seated, but the food is spectacular. I usually have to get a box to go because I have a hard time finishing all of the deliciousness. 

The only thing I ask, if you're going to eat here, leave your kids at home. So tired of going to this place and people let their little kids run and scream and carry on all over the place."
1506,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Its very seldom that I actually don't like a dish. Something that sounded delicious on the menu but just doesn't taste that good. The chicken benedic was terrible.  Its not that it was put together poorly or anything,  i just really didn't like it. I ate half of my wifes cornbeef hash. It was only ok.. very over rated."
1507,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food was so fresh and prepared so deliciously!!! Service was fast and kind!! Great place! You can totally share with two people or maybe three because the portions are huge!
1508,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was highly recommended by a couple of people. The place looked nice and the staff was friendly. They had a pretty decent sized menu and I was debating on a couple of things. I got the corned beef hash which was good, and my fiancÃ© had the biscuits and gravy & really liked it. The down side was that they advertised they had the best bloody Mary's and it wasn't good at all. It said it had a fresh tomato pinwheel & bacon, and mine was only served with a green bean, olive, and lemon. And the mix wasn't good either, not very flavorful and  tasted watered down. And I'm sure this would be different if I was going back to my house or something, but the portions were monstrous! I'm one of those people who hates wasting food and there is absolutely no way I would be able to finish any of the plates they had there. I wish they would've told us how extremely big the portions were and we could have split something. And again if I would've been going home I could've taken leftovers, but we were walking the strip so that wasn't an option. Since I hate wasting food, we overstuffed a Togo box, which shows how much food we both had left, and gave it to a homeless group on the strip asking for food. So just a heads up from the staff to anyone that hasn't eaten there before would be nice."
1509,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My friends and I tried the chicken and waffles, man vs. food combo, fried chicken salad, and steak and eggs..the portions are huge.. fried chicken happens to be my fave but it tastes horrible here...very disappointing. It's dry and flavorless. The waffles and steak are good."
1510,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always an awesome meal. No one person needs as much food as you're served, so think about sharing. I get the Man vs Food favorite every time I go."
1511,Hash House A Go Go,5,We always eat at Hash House A Go Go when we visit San Diego. So of course I was happy with my experience at this one. Gigantic portions. I like their lunch items (especially the BLT) and my husband likes the French toast.
1512,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A friend suggested this place for breakfast because of their portions. Decided to come before hopping on a red eye flight back home. I think I came super early around 530am, and it wasn't a soul in sight lol. Decided to order the corned beef hash with red potatoes and swiss cheese. The portions were huge I must say, and the corned beef was pretty decent. A small thing on how I like my corned beef hash is I like the potatoes to shredded or cubed that's all. Decided to get my egg over easy to sit on top of the corned beef hash. Definitely good and fulfilling breakfast before I went to the airport. I would order again but I would ask them if they have any shredded or cubed breakfast potatoes, just smaller that's all..."
1513,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Might of been the best meal I have ever had. Only 4 stars though because of hostess. Was skipped in line after waiting an hour. Was lied to saying my name was called twice.. almost walked out, glad I didn't the food was exceptional."
1514,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was our first time eating here, and we had one of the best experiences. We had the brown sugar banana pancake at our waiters ( 41158 Bryan )recommendation. Wow that was the best pancake we have ever eaten!!!!   The service was more then exceptional. Our drink were never empty, the food was unbelievably good, and the out waiter was very professional and friendly. The portions are enough to feed you for a few days.

thanks Hash House...and a big thanks to Bryan."
1515,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came for brunch.  Wait was quick since one of our friends got the gambler's card perks.  

Ordered the corned beef hash.  Portion was HUGE but food was average. The wait for food was a bit slow but the waitress said it was because there were some large parties ahead of us.  

This would be a good spot to cure your nasty vegas hangovers."
1516,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Experience is everything, and when you get your customers order wrong and they wait expecting the food they thought they ordered to come and it not be it- you ruin the whole thing. Let me stress the importance of reading back your customers order... :/ I would usually turn the food around, but I know it's going to take another 20 minutes to make the right order cause everything is made from scratch which would just further the agonizing time wasted here."
1517,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I've been to two other locations in Vegas so I tried this one out last month.
The wait was crazy long but at least you can come back and check how long you still have...
We waited about 30 minutes for 2 to be seated.
I ordered the Mushroom, Artichoke Artichoke Hearts, Sundried Tomato and Fresh Spinach which is under Hashes.  The biscuit was good!  Most the dish was good but the most important item ""HASH"" aka Potatoes aka on their menu ""Crispy Potatoes"" the potatoes sucked!!!! I would say maybe 2 pieces if that many were crispy....Well if you advertise CRISPY please keep it that way! 
That's all i got to say!  Fix your HASH! :)"
1518,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is great! I came here in the evening on a weekday, because I knew it would be packed otherwise. I made the right choice because I was seated immediately. The place was maybe 1/3 full. It was my first time, and I went with the sage fried chicken benedict. As you've read in the other reviews, the portions are HUGE! I dived in and it was like nothing I've ever eaten before. It was a mountain of PURE JOY! It went well with my mango iced tea. Of course, I couldn't eat it all, so yay I had a box of leftovers for later! I also ordered the ribs appetizer to go. Well, guess what? It also came with an entire stalk of grilled and marinated corn. Delicious!!! Can't wait to go back!"
1519,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We were seated fairly quickly. Took a while to get the speciality coffees we ordered. Mine came just warm asked to make it hotter, came back and burnt my throat. Should have seen the writing on the wall. I would like to say I'm a foodie I like unique and different flavours but this was not enjoyable.  We ordered one plate the wait staff let us know a couple of times the portions were very large.  I personally found it way to much, would prefer regular portions, average prices and both try a dish instead of feeling we needed to share not to waste.  We ordered the HH original Benedict. To be fare the waitress warned the sauce had a red bell pepper taste.  The menus says red pepper cream sauce. What we got was purÃ©ed red peppers over eggs and raw spinach on a biscuit with mashed potatoes underneath.  Hated, hated every bit of this, my spouse ate it but not thrilled.  I wasn't the only one the two ladies across from us ordered the same pushed it aside and ordered a second plate of pancakes which she ate about 1/8 of it. She agreed it wasn't enjoyable also, so I don't think I'm so unusual. Be aware no ""regular items here"" read the menus carefully before making the trip to eat here."
1520,Hash House A Go Go,1,I went there the day before Xmas and let's just say I was a grinch for Xmas. My stomach turned and turned the next day. I don't recommend
1521,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fresh food, service and extremely large portions!! Thanks Hash House!! You are grandios in CAESARS PALACE."
1522,Hash House A Go Go,2,Hash house a go go looked amazing in pictures had 4 stars so my family and I waited 45 minutes. My sister and I ordered the fried chicken Benedict and the combo platter. The fried chicken Benedict is advertised as man v food favorite. The presentation of dishes at this restaurant is fantastic. However this is the definition of style over substance.  The biscuit and chicken were fried out and by the time we got the food it was cold. The flapjack was dry and bland.
1523,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions! Delicious comfort/hangover food! We had the fried green tomatoes and they were heavenly. I had the meatloaf on a different visit, and it was also scrumptious."
1524,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Sweet chocolate christ- I don't know what they put in those honey biscuits- but make sure you get a side of maple syrup with them! It'll taste like heaven!!! 
Went there a long time ago, when I still ate meat, and their salmon is perfection! You really should try it!
I no longer eat meat, so when we g, I order their breakfast items and they're delicious! I'm usually not a fan of restaurant/ grocery eggs (I get my eggs from a real farm with chickens so I notice the difference VERY well) but their eggs were decent! And their crispy potatoes---- yes, please!!! Someone in our group ordered the French toast and it looked like a serving for 20! LOL 
But be warned- just when you think you can't eat any more and you wanna pop- you'll taste those honey biscuits and you'll wish that that was all you had ordered! 
Now I'm hungry for them! :p"
1525,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Just go.




Okay, okay I'll write more.
Portions are ginormous.
I ordered the salmon/cream cheese hash which comes in a skillet so it stays hot. It was super good. I made the excellent addition of spinach but that cost me $3.95 what the fudge. So don't add anything on without asking how much it would be first. 
The half tea/lemonade wasn't that good.
Also, could they please play some better music? Or not play anything at all.

My waiter was cute so I left him my number and he hasn't called, that's why they're only getting 3 stars.

I'll be back.

The price equals the portions equals the flavor."
1526,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go is a great spot for breakfast. The portions are pretty big, so its perfect for splitting. I will definitely be coming back!"
1527,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Me and my boyfriend came to hash house because of our restaurant.com coupon and because of all the great reviews.  

We went on a Sunday morning and it was a 45 minute wait.  They give you pagers but they don't work downstairs on the casino floor.  Our waiter was really cool and very informative about the menu.  He talked us into ordering the the chicken and waffles for me and my boyfriend had a meatloaf sandwich with fries.  Omg the portions were huge!  I tasted my bf meatloaf and it was soooo good! My waffles were really good but the chicken I think needed a little more seasoning but they did put a little bit off sauce on the plate for the chicken. But  overall the food was good. Had a great time and would go back again!"
1528,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow, what can I say about this place...probably the BEST dining experience I had in Las Vegas. One of the least expensive places to eat I found, and not only was the food and service amazing, the portion sizes were ridiculously big! Next time I'm in Vegas I may have to eat here every meal of the day!"
1529,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Definitely come here on an empty stomach. Hash House is a must for foodies. It's located in the LINQ and has a floor of its own. There is plenty of seating, but there is oftentimes a long wait, but let me tell you, it's worth it!

Everytime I come here I always need to share a dish because the portions are so huge. I always get the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and it is always so satisfying. Even sharing this with one other person is still more than enough food for me. They give you about 3 pieces of each the chicken and the waffles, but they are 3 large pieces of each. The chicken is really succulent and the batter isn't too greasy. It has a distinct flavor and doesn't taste like your typical fried chicken. It's even better paired with the waffles! The waffles are thick and have small pieces of bacon in them, which is pretty interesting tasting but still great especially topped with the maple syrup. While everything tastes amazing, one of my favorite parts of the dish were by far the fried leeks! I had never had them cooked that way and it adds a crunch to the dish. All of the sweet and savory aspects just fuse so well together. Make sure to get a little of everything for each bite.

On top of all of that, the presentation is awesome. They take their time to make each dish look appetizing enough to make your mouth water. However, this is one of those places you go to indulge in all your gluttony. Everything here is extremely excessive, but it's all in moderation! All in all, this is a great dining experience while you're in Vegas."
1530,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I had to go here because it was featured on Man vs. Food.  I love Adam Richman to the point that I want my future kid (if I were to have one) to be named after him.  I watch his shows and I constantly watch the reruns on Netflix.  Dude, I hyperventilated when he friended me on Facebook (his personal page!!!).  

For those of you that know me can vouch that I have a pretty big appetite.  I have the appetite of a 6 foot lumberjack.  Heck, I ate more than the boyfriend and his younger brother in a single sitting so... w/ that said, I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict.  The entree: hipotle cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, mozzarella, fried chicken, bacon, tomatoes, spinach, biscuits on top of potatoes.  

The size of this thing is huge but I cleaned it no problem.

What was disappointing though was that although the combination is crazy and unique, it was rather bland and dry.  I hardly ever use ketchup on my breakfast but I had to resort to that since the chicken was extremely dry.  

The boyfriend got a regular omelet w/ a bloody mary (you get to keep the glass) and the younger brother ordered the bacon waffle w/ whipped cream and a glass of milk but our server failed and brought out chocolate milk instead.  

The food took some time because we were told everything was made from scratch.  The wait was fine since the 3 of us talked and if I recall, both guys were on their phone playing games whilst I looked on.  I was pissed that I had no reception (AT&T/iPhone) plus I did not want to drain my battery.  

After devouring about 7,000 calories, I was ready to drink my glass of water and tackle on the macaroons at Bouchon Bakery and that was exactly what we did... if I continue to eat like this, I must live at the gym but thankfully I don't eat like this daily although I so could.  

Thanks to the eating escapades and overloading on diet sodas, I'm not eating meat and have not touched diet soda since Monday.  It is only Wednesday and I've lost my Vegas weight gain and feel pretty darn proud of myself."
1531,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was awesome.   Your can purchase drinks while you wait.   Bloody Mary's were tasty.   One we sat down.. the waiter came right away.   After we ordered. . We didn't expect so much food. . Portions were huge. . Well worth the money.
1532,Hash House A Go Go,5,What can I say I love his place! It's a must whenever I go to Vegas. The portions are huge!!!!! And for the price it's not bad. You honestly can share a plate there's more than enough for two. Really good food. Only down part is that sometimes the wait is long but that's just because it's good
1533,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The service was such a disappointment. We had the unfortunate experience with a server who was short with us. In particular, he asked us if we were ready to order and then we responded yes. Then, one of my friends ordered a ""short stack of pancakes. Unfortunately, this wasn't on the menu. The servers response was rude as he said, ""look at the menu. We don't serve that here. You guys need more time."" We were in shock. Seriously? Okay. My friend make a mistake and he shouldn't have assumed that was a dish to order. However, this server didn't have to give us so much attitude and just leave and decide for us, basically, that we weren't ready to order. I really don't think this place is worth your time. The food is so-so and it just looks IG worthy. That's about it."
1534,Hash House A Go Go,1,The food takes forever at breakfest. Cooled food when it gets to you.. do not watse ur time or money
1535,Hash House A Go Go,4,"As the cheddar cheese slowly repels from the burger, I quickly snatch it with my tongue before the jealously hungry plate that caresses my burger even touches my meal. Yes I am a jealous person when  it comes to good food.  Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar burger on a fresh bun (I do not know the name of the bread but it was YUM!)  was fabulously delicious with the fries as the only disappointment. To me they tasted as if they were borrowed from Burger King.

And the woman sitting on the table next to us kept asking questions when we took a bite. That's okay. She was curious about everyone's food taking a photo of me every time I sunk my teeth into the over-sized $13.00 burger.

The server was fabulous checking up on us frequently; however only exception was the busboy and hostess did not bring the Cucumber ranch dressing my friend was eating in a bowl large enough to fit a 10 pound cat. We had to ask the waiter and he brought it to us within 2 minutes. If only the busboy could have taken two minutes from the conversation with the hostess about his dog to bring the dressing might have brought up the score 1 notch.

NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE HUGE PORTIONS."
1536,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Lots of food-think about sharing.  Food is good depending on the item.

Egg dishes have always been good.
Chicken and Waffles - excellent
Oatmeal.  Not so good.   The oatmeal came with unripe bitter hard green fruit.  Not just one piece, but all of the varieties.  Ordering issue.   If you don't have ripe fruit, just tell me and/or don't serve it.
Drinks are good.
Pancakes-many varieties - excellent pot hole sized.

Service is slow, but friendly and the wait time is really really really long.   last time I was told the wait would be 1 hr, but 1.5 hours later we were almost ready to be seated.  Not worth the time for me.  I only went this last time because friends wanted to go."
1537,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yes! Every time Im in Vegas I hit this spot. The breakfast portions are huge but the food is fresh and delicious. French toast and waffles are a must. BLT sandwich has a knife in the middle of the sandwich to hold it up. Expect to wait to get in because of how great the food is and the name brings people. The wait staff is excellent.
1538,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I came here with high hopes after reading all of the great reviews.

I ordered the Hash House Famous Big O' Sage Fried Chicken Salad. I don't understand what makes it so ""famous."" The portion was gigantic. Great value, but it was lacking in flavor. It left much to be desired. Also, there were old, soggy pieces of lettuce included in my salad. Couldn't the kitchen at least pick these pieces out? I picked them out and continued to eat anyway.  I left feeling very full, but not satisfied. My date ordered the mushroom and swiss burger, and again, the portion was huge, but when I asked him how his meal was, he said it was just an ok burger. I MIGHT return, and if I do, I'll give breakfast a try.  

No wait to be seated. Service was great. But let's be real, it all comes down to THE FOOD. I'm a local and feel kinda disappointed, as I was hoping Hash House would become a go-to. I think not."
1539,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After spending a fortune on lunch somewhere else, this place is just what we were looking for. Something a bit less pricey, but tasty, and a nice big portion. 

We walked in around 9PM on a pretty busy Monday night. Our wait was less than 15 minutes. We were seated and given water in less than 5 minutes. 

Let me tell you, this place doesn't screw around. The portion sizes are HUGE. The food/$ ratio is off the charts here. For two of us, our bill came to $29. I had the bacon, avocado, cheese stuffed burger with cheddar bacon mashed potatoes. My fiancÃ© had a mozzarella and red pepper stuff burger with mashed potatoes. Both meals were awesome and let me tell you, just ONE of those meals would have cost around $30 anywhere else on the Strip. Both meals came out steaming hot. If I had one complaint, it would be that the mashed potatoes were a bit dry - needed more butter - other than that, great meal, good service, and a very, very fair price."
1540,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge line and well worth it!

*TIP: If you are a diamond club member show your card and you will be seated ahead of the long line.

This place is cramped and the tables are small. However once you see the food coming out of the kitchen you will thank me.

If you like breakfast with chicken, this is the place to for you. Roscoe's may have started the chicken and waffle craze but Hash House a Go Go has taken it to another level. There were 6 in my party and we all had diffident plates and ate family style. The server was very friendly and helped us choose. All were delicious and will only say that the eggs Benedict were not bad, however they were not out of this world like the other plates.

COME HUNGRY and ENJOY!"
1541,Hash House A Go Go,3,Excellent food and atmosphere. Definitely recommend the meatloaf hash or sandwich. Yum. Dishes are easily large enough to share.  Tawny our waitress was friendly and attentive. Would definitely recommend to friends and family but would make reservation in advance due to long wait time.
1542,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is the place Man vs Food host Adam Richman ate. I loved everything about this restaurant. Large portions of food that's really flavorful. You will need to go boxes for sure. You should make this a top 5 food destination place to visit in Vegas or San Diego.
1543,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If ever I find myself starving in vegas, and by starving I mean ravenous enough to eat a baby elephant, Hash House A Go Go is my favorite place to go. 

The portions here are out of control. It doesn't matter what you order, each order can feed 2-4 people. But despite this, I always like ordering my own entree because that means I'll have leftovers for drunken munchies post-clubbing. 

A few of my favorite things here: 
-Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (under the Indiana Favorites of the breakfast menu)
-Any of the flavored flapjacks
-French Toast
-Famous Sausage (under the Indiana Favorites of the breakfast menu)
-Roasted Chicken House Hash.

If there's a must get for me every time I'm here, it's the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade. Not too sweet, not too tart, not too tangy... just right! And the thick, giant watermelon slice to garnish the drink is the icing on the cake. Don't leave HHaGG without ordering this!! 

Yes, this place is not health-conscious or diet friendly. The portions are much too large, the food is super rich and hearty and probably artery clogging...... but cmon folks... live a little!"
1544,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I came here one morning, just like apparently 2300 other people did! haha. It's a regular diner but it's inside a casino so it's pretty dark. I really prefer an outdoor spot or at least one with windows.

Anyway, if you are into massive portions this place is for you. I tried to get something reasonable so steak n eggs did the trick. I'm not sure I knew what to expect. The food was actually really good. What impressed the hell out of me was how amazing our server was! She was all over and on top of everything. She really made our experience!

I think sometimes it's challenging to find a place to eat in Vegas especially if you're on a budget but I would recommend checking this one out for breakfast because you can get some quality food at a reasonable price."
1545,Hash House A Go Go,5,Went to Vegas this past winter and decided to try Hash House A Go Go.  We ended up liking it so much that we returned for a second visit in the same week.  The portions are huge and the meals were fantastic.  Definitely a place to go while in Vegas.
1546,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here after clubbing and I had previously NEVER heard of this amazing place. It's located in the Quad which is formerly imperial palace. You take the escalators up to the restaurant which is fairly large. Service was great and attentive.

Food: We got the steak and eggs which portion wise wasn't a lot but tasted amazing. Either that or I was really buzzed. I saw another person with the Benedict and that plate was HUGEEEEE. They do seem to have a lot of specialty plates that I would love to come back and try.

This place is definitely a toss up with Earls for after hours spot. Price is decent enough as well. I'd compare this to a Denny's diner kind of feel."
1547,Hash House A Go Go,1,"They refused service due to my pregnancy?!!

I must say I'm really quite sad to write this review as this was once one of my favorite spots on the strip, but I will not be returning.

I was visiting Vegas along with a group of 6 people.  I'm currently 10 weeks pregnant with twins, so while they decided to walk to the restaurant, I hopped a cab because I wasn't feeling too well and was in a hurry to get some food in my stomach.  I figured I'd arrive 15 mins early and be able to get a table and get my food order in immediately. 

Once I arrived, the place was dead (it was about 9:30 pm), so I asked to be seated at a table for 6.  The hostess informed me that she was unable to seat me without the remainder of my party.  I was quite surprised as the majority of the tables were empty.  I explained that I am pregnant and experiencing morning sickness which worsens as I get hungry, could they please make an exception and seat me.  No, nothing she could do.   

At this time, I started dry heaving.  Now there is not a bathroom in this place, you have to go down and through the casino in order to find one, so I grabbed the garbage can from the hostess station and sat down.  I asked the hostess if I could at least get a sprite right now to calm my stomach?  She pointed to the bar and said, yeah, go ahead.   I was shocked that with NOTHING TO DO, she didn't even offer to go and retrieve it for me!!!   I rushed back to the bar and ordered my sprite (which they made me pay for at that time, instead of just tacking it onto my dinner bill - kind of unussual...) and sat back down to continue heaving.  

As the dry heaving continued, I asked the hostess if I could put a food order in from the lobby.   No, not until you're seated (but of course they wouldn't seat me).  When the dry heaving continued, I asked her to bring me out a biscuit (they give these out for free with dinner)  which thankfully, she did and I was able to wolf that down and my stomach started to settle.    

Shortly after that, my party arrived.  They alerted the hostess, who then spent another 10 minutes readying the table (seriously?!)  and finally sat us.   I immediately ordered some food and asked the waiter to rush it.  While the rest of the group looked over the menu.   While we waited, I began to feel sick again.  I went over and grabbed a small trash can and brought it under our table, just in case because the distance to the bathroom was quite far.   

A minute or so after sitting back down, the manager, Shawn, walks up to the table ""I'm sympathetic to your situation, but I can't have this here""   I assumed he meant the trash can, so I said ""Ok, maybe you could bring me a bowl just in case?""   ""No Ma'am, I mean YOU; you need to leave.  I just can't have you in my restaurant, it's disturbing to other patrons""  My jaw completely dropped - for one thing, there was no one else around us!   For another, I hadn't actually thrown up a single time and hadn't even gagged while seated at the table!!  I was completely confused - ""the rest of your party is welcome to stay, but I'm going to have to have to ask you to leave""   At this point I felt terrible and burst in to tears begging him to ""please just pack up my food, I need to eat before I faint!  I need to eat!  Please!""  At first he refused, but I think as the tears were flowing, he started to get a little embarrassed.  He went back into the kitchen and brought back a small plate of corned beef, dropped it at the table and then rushed away.   

As I wolfed down my food between tears, the waiter returned and we asked him to send over another manager as we were pretty horrified with the treatment.    A female manager returned.  She did not apologize for the behavior or the other manager, but did say ""if you'd like to stay, you can stay""  But honestly at this point, we weren't willing to patronize the place anymore.  

So she brings back the BILL.   ""you expect me to PAY for this after the way I was treated?!""   ""well Ma'am, you DID eat it""   I should have walked out, but I was very upset and just handed her my credit card - $10 for by biscuit, soda, and a handful of corned beef.    

We made a complaint to the hotel manager (The Quad) and although she was very nice and understanding, she stated that they did not have an affiliation with the restaurant and there really was nothing that she could do about how they ran their business.  

Sadly, I won't ever be returning.  The lack of any empathy from the staff is ridiculous.  With so many wonderful places on the strip and every other experience this trip great customer service, this place won't ever make the cut again."
1548,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I went to Hash House A Go Go for the first time in San Diego and had a fantastic plate of food with fantastic company. So when I was looking for brunch places in Vegas, and saw that it was conveniently located down the strip, I told my friends and family we were going there for brunch.

We arrived for a late brunch on a Saturday. At about 2:00 probably. And it looked like there was a long wait, but in fact the queue went by quite quickly. In fact, our friends weren't there yet, so we had to tell them that we weren't ready to be seated. However, since we waited quite awhile for them, we were first in the queue when they did come, so we got seated fairly quickly after they arrived.

The service is a bit hectic, but our server was really nice and helpful. We ordered Bloody Marys all around, and I opted for the BLT Mary. It comes with toast and a packet of mayonaiise and you get to build your own mini BLT with the garnish. Fun and tasty! Not the best Bloody Mary around, but big and strong enough to get the job done.

I had the sage chicken benedict and it was really incredible. The other half ordered the chorizo hash and it was also really tasty. Just a lot of food. A lot. Like none of us finished our meals. But that's okay. It's not incredibly expensive for the food you get, and they weren't really in a rush to get us out so we got to chill out and have a good time.

Our friends who are Vegas veterans (they live close by so get out here quite a bit) were impressed with my choice as they really enjoyed their lunch. I'd definitely come back and go to other locations. Maybe try something else. But their benedicts are so good, it would be hard for me to choose something else."
1549,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I saw this place on Man Vs Food and he had rave reviews for it.  Since everything you see on TV is true, I decided to stop here this weekend cause I expected delicious food.

This location is located in one of the classiest casino and hotels on the Las Vegas strip, the Imperial Palace.  It's Asian motif along with the celebrity impersonators makes it a grade A destination in the 702. It's located upstairs and I heard it's pretty new to the casino.  Definitely looks new.

My friends and I waited about 45 minutes to get a table.  I spent the time wisely, winning 60 bucks at the blackjack table.  The place is pretty crowded as they accommodate big parties.  The restaurant is really big as I saw tables and tables of people.

The wait for the food took a while, I'd probably say like 25-30 minutes.  For some reason, I fell in and out of hungriness so by the time I got my food, I wasn't as hungry as I was an hour ago. That was really a shame because the portions were pretty damn huge.  When I looked at my friends' faces, they looked as if it was more of a task than a great meal.  

I ended  up ordering the Fried Chicken Benedict, which was featured on Man V Food I believe.  It wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  The damn thing was HUGE but there was so much going on with that thing that the flavor's just mashed up and it was like I was eating slop.  Fried Chicken and bacon are two of my favorite things but when they are combined, it's just too rich for me.  There was just too many diff flavors combined into one.  

I don't recall any of my friends saying their food was great but maybe everyone was full.  I saved half of the food for later and ate it after a night of drinking. For some reason, that shit still wasn't super appetizing.  Those fries Ray gave me were better tasting!

Overall, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  If you like big portions, holler at this place.  Honestly, I don't think the wait was worth it but possibly go on a weekday or something and I'm sure the lines will be shorter."
1550,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I ate here one afternoon this past April. The menu is extensive and tempting. The theme of ""twisted farm food"" (i.e affordable comfort dishes with a contemporary spin) is imaginative and well-executed. My grilled cheese sandwich was huge and delicious with all kinds of cool extra ingredients. The side of mashed potatoes with bacon and cheese was equally humungous and delicious. The margaritas here are good also. The bartender who served me hit a nice balance of behaving in a relaxed manner while being very quick and efficient. For me, this place is a must-visit next time I am close to the mid-Strip. Recommended!"
1551,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is the hair band of breakfast places- lots of show, not a lot of talent, maybe one good song, maybe. I have been here before and I remembered it with fond memories but after eating here I can't remember why.

The value is here but not the quality. The server was nice/gracious, even offering coffee to go. But the floors and chairs are dirty and worn out, the food quality is marginal. The fried chicken is greasy, dry and  not real meaty. 

There is a Bloody Mary blt which was pretty good but didn't make sense. It came with brutally dry toast and thank god a packet of mayo so I didn't choke but the big straw helped it all go down.

This is big portions, lots of show and you can feed your family reasonably. If you have eaten any place that has been truly four stars or above before eating here, you are going to wonder why you came. Too many choices in Vegas to eat here, find some good quality food! Sorry Hash House got to go go..."
1552,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We got there right around 8am on Saturday morning and were seated immediately. By the time we left around 9am there was a long line.
We had sage fried chicken Benedict and chorizo hash. Both were REALLY good. Huge portions and great service. We couldn't finish all the potatoes and still were full till dinner time.
Service was great and coffee was surprisingly awesome. We had to ask if they brewed Starbucks. Biscuits were home made and overall a fun experience. Will definitely come back when in LV."
1553,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Pretty long wait to be seated, then for the food to come but well worth it! Everyone at my table had a beautiful presentation on their plate and everything tasted amazing. Would've had 5 stars if wait wasn't so long. Portions are huge , u get what u pay for also. Definitely would recommend anyone visiting Vegas to go here for brunch."
1554,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place serves some of the best comfort food ever....we had the best server ever R.J., he kept us entertained, always with a smile and a witty comeback and comeback we did, the very next day! Thank you Rj for help making my birthday week a memorable one."
1555,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great place to eat! It was pretty packed when I went (Mother's Day). We waited about 30 mins. I ordered the chicken&waffles and it didn't disappoint. I got to share some with my boyfriend and son. We will go again...hopefully soon!
1556,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We absolutely loved this place.  First, Kye took amazing care of us. Her recommendations were spot on and the food was beyond our expectations.  I have had many fried green tomatoes,  and these were by far our favorite.  We will be back, and we will make sure to sit in Kye's section!"
1557,Hash House A Go Go,4,Came here last Saturday for brunch. Ordered the chicken and waffles. Best chicken and waffles ever. Reasonably priced for the portion size. I wish they had a stand alone fried chicken dish that came with mashed potatoes and corn. My only complaint is with the ice water. Definitely tasted like it came from a not so clean tap. The food is definitely worth the visit.
1558,Hash House A Go Go,5,OMG this was the BEST chicken and waffles I've ever had. The combination of the leeks and syrup gave the dish an even better taste. My go-to place on The Strip for sure!!!!
1559,Hash House A Go Go,5,Chicken and waffles!!!! The best! Enough for 2 to share. The best service and a huge variety on menu. Great diner atmosphere.
1560,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Except for portion size, quality is inconsistent. I ate here two times, and at another location in Vegas once. Being a diamond member helps as you skip the 60 minute line in the morning, and the wait is 5 minutes at most. Wait staff is constantly rushed and feels like a fast food service. This was unexpected and true for all my visits. They are apparently famous for their spicy bloody marys but that didn't work out for me despite trying twice. The first time I didn't receive it at all, and after getting the food I asked when will it come, the waitress said ""oh so sorry, coming right up"" and it came at the end of my meal. Of course I rejected it at that point. The second time I specified I wanted it extra spicy, it came quick, but it was sour without any spice, so I asked for a redo. It didn't come until, again, the end of my meal, so again I asked to return it. Shame. Never take your own meal, it's a waste even if you're a big eater, because ordering more is easy and I haven't seen anyone in any table finish a meal. We had the Ranchero eggs (which were great the first time, ok the second), and the maple banana pancake (twice was yummy) which we shared between the 4 of us. Plenty food! Overall, it's an ""experience"" and worth it when sharing a meal, and/or not in a rush to sit or have a Diamond membership."
1561,Hash House A Go Go,4,Servings are huge!!! Even the kids menu is impressive! There was no wait for Diamond card holders!!!
1562,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food is solid and a good value. Service was a little slow especially because the place wasn't at all busy, but the people were friendly. You get a real bang for your buck here, and great food for soaking up the alcohol. This place is a budget saver for me in LV."
1563,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wife and I went here with friends while we were at CES and I can't say enough good things about their breakfast. The portions were huge, and the flavor was out-of-this-world. And, in the Vegas world of $30-40 subpar breakfast buffets, a cooked-to-order breakfast for around $15 is a steal.

The pancakes are bigger than the plates and the chicken and waffles is a great presentation that stands about 12-14"" high."
1564,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Been here a few times and there is nothing I am going to write that hasn't already been said.  There are two things I can recommend: 1) BRING AN APPETITE and 2) come here after a long night of drinking and partying. The perfect place to cure the ills of the night before or get back on the train to happiness. 

On to the recommendations of food. Nothing new to say, Andys Sage Chicken is the go to and BLT Bloody Mary. Same thing every time.  

If there is one NEGATIVE,  I would have to say that the wait is somewhat long bordering on ridiculous. If you get there before 8-8:30, you are usually ok. After that good luck. For us to wait, eat, and get back to hotel was a 3 hour excursion. I bring all this up because I really believe the waitresses are to blame. I understand they are busy, but if they were more attentive, not only would things be quicker, but they would turn more table over which everyone knows means more tips and probably big ones at that. For example, we were done for 15 and the waitress had to be flagged down for us to leave.
All in all, I still give a five because it is worth it if you got the time and patience. 

Shout out to @nunezcesar7 for the good times here."
1565,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Woke up this morning with breakfast on my mind. Found this place on Yelp. Short walk from the hotel. Wait for 2 was supposed to be 25-35min, but table was ready in 15min (yes)! The portions are large so consider sharing. The food was solid. The service was fast and friendly. Would highly recommend and would come again when in Vegas!"
1566,Hash House A Go Go,3,Server was a jerk!!! We ordered the crab cake Benedict and we were not able to eat it due to the spiciness of it. Explained to the server and he thru a little hissy fit and started slamming dishes around. He had us scared so we didn't know what else to order. Luckily we ordered the bacon and that was great. Sucks the server ruined or experience.
1567,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fantastic food!  A bit of a wait, but well worth it. Our server was the very cheerful Louisa. She made us feel right at home. I had the corned beef hash and my bf had the sage fried chicken benedict. Both delicious. Both huge!  I swear my plate still looked like it had a full meal on it when I was finished!  Giant portions of really good food. The strawberry lemonade was yummy too"
1568,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had brunch on Sept 10th,long wait but had the best blueberry pancake I've ever consumed in my life!! Had to share it with my daughter because it is absolutely huge. Will definitely be back :)"
1569,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food was to die for! Ordered a vanilla waffle and chorizo scramble...haven't had food this great in a long time. Wait was an hr for a party of 2, I can understand why. We ended sitting at the bar after about 15 minutes of waiting. Our bartender, Kye was amazing. Haven't seen such great customer service in a long time. Prices r great, bill was only $25. Would come back to vegas just to eat here!"
1570,Hash House A Go Go,2,I think this place is way over rated. We waited an hour and a half for a table of 5 . I got a Bloody Mary and the chicken pot pie . Prices are reasonable for all the food you receive. I enjoyed the Bloody Mary it gave me a good buzz . The food on the other hand I disliked very much . The chicken pot pie was just way to much and it lacked flavor... I really think they should cut portion size ... Tons of food going to waste each hour . If I ever return I'll be getting breakfast because it looked pretty good !
1571,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went around 8pm on a Sunday night.  No wait.  We had a great waitress.  My wife was not very hungry and ordered a small house salad.  The dressing was great.  I ordered the chicken pot pie.  It was INCREDIBLE!  You have to see it to believe it...lots of white meat chicken breast.  They included lots of vegetables including:  carrots, corn, spinach, broccoli and mushrooms. It was served in the home made crust that looked like an upside down cowboy hat.  Inside the crust and on the plate was the best mashed potatoes I have ever eaten.  This is a must dish in Las Vegas."
1572,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The bartender RJ is AMAZING!! Was really welcoming, up beat, and just a great personality.
All the staff was friendly! Food was also fantastic! High recommended if you want good food and a good time!"
1573,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions of food.  Oh my goodness I really like this place.  It was breakfast time servers were in the pajamas,  place was busy but not once were we unattended to.  My fiancÃ©e got the Andy sage fried chicken or shall I say man vs food choice.  I got the neapanee hash lunch special.  Both dishes were so good. Food comes hot as there is no hot lamps or microwave as soon as it's done, food is straight to you. Fresh squeezed oj. Bartender is heavy on the hands  This place is a must visit! !"
1574,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're ever in Vegas and would like a breakfast/brunch spot that's not a buffet, then look no further than the Linq casino home of Hash House.

Unfortunately you will not be immediately seated as this is a pretty popular spot and the wait can take up to 30 minutes to an hour and maybe even more. So I just grabbed a number and checked out the Flamingo mini zoo they had on their property. You could also gamble away your wait time before it's time to eat.

My group of friends got some pretty spicy Bloody Mary's which came with souvenir cups. For food, the Two Sage Fried Chicken Breasts looked amazing which came with waffles infused with bacon (yes you read that correctly), hot maple reduction, fried leeks and served with two eggs. Me being the corned beef hash kind of guy got their Corned Beef Hash which you could tell was not straight out of a can like diners do it. It was a pile of home fries on the bottom and fresh beef on top all held together with your choice of cheese. It was already better than all diner versions of corned beef hash.

By the end of all of this, there was just too much carbs on the plate to finish everything. So I'd recommend coming in on an empty stomach or ordering food to split between two or more. As other reviews pointed out, the portions are massive and a lot will go to waste."
1575,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yummy food, big portions, great prices and service. Seems always busy but worth the wait."
1576,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great for large groups!  Attentive server but food takes a good while.  Everything prepared fresh and well worth the wait.  You may want to consider sharing as portions are HUGE!  Chicken Benedict was delicious with creamy chipotle sauce.   Meatloaf hash had roasted red peppers and spinach, great combination!  Kiwi watermelon lemonade was on point.  May be back this weekend."
1577,Hash House A Go Go,5,Always great! We always stop here to enjoy breakfast when in Las Vegas. The portions are HUGE. A couple can share a meal.
1578,Hash House A Go Go,5,One of the best breakfast places in Vegas. You can't beat the prices for the amount of food you get. I have yet to be let down by the food so far. I would recommend the pot pie and chicken with waffles.
1579,Hash House A Go Go,5,"vegas's best breakfast EVER!!!! ginormous portions!  i had a mango coconut pancake that was even good reheated in the hotel microwave!  the pancake is at least 10"" in diameter.  I might have finished a quarter of it at the table. might.  i did finish the rest later tho!  never thought i'd eat a leftover pancake......

 i always get the goat-cheese salad too cuz i'm a sucker for goat cheese everywhere i go.... its warm yumminess that doesnt even make mii mind the fact that i'm eating vegetables ;)  everything is fresh and scrumptious!

my dad got a skillet that was also big enough to feed two.  the biscuits come with basically everything, also ridiculously huge in a good way!  they're about 4-5"" tall and come out fresh and piping hot with a sprig of rosemary planted in the middle.  (u just have to see the portion sizes to know how big beautiful and wonderful all the food there is!!!!"
1580,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Very good place to eat breakfast in Vegas. My husband had the man vs food breakfast (in picture) one day and it was huge. He loved it so much we came back the next day. Our waiter was fantastic also-which is a big plus. I'm a new coffee drinker and their nitro coffee was delicious-very creamy and it had nothing in it. That creamy taste was because of the way it is made. I also had a Bloody Mary and it was delicious. Wish I had one right now! Lastly, the biscuits and gravy were really good too."
1581,Hash House A Go Go,3,"4 stars really should've been given but our steak that was with the steak and eggs was not good at all. In fact it was rubbery. But the chicken and waffles was absolutely delicious. ORDER IS BIG ENOUGH FOR 2. 

Service was great, presentation was above what was expected of a late night joint."
1582,Hash House A Go Go,5,I can't wait to come back here. I tell everyone about it and was sad I didn't get a chance to go by last time I was in Vegas. Must eat in Vegas!!!
1583,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We went for breakfast on a thursday, had a few minutes wait, but not bad.  Kelly, our waitress was great.  She was running her butt off, waiting tables and tending bar, but we never were neglected.  Coffee was great.  Portions were, as said before, HUGE.  I had the chicken and waffles which were great.  I could of used more syrup and/or the sauce drizzled around the edge of the plate.  My husband had the tractor diver combo with french toast.  It came with warm bananas and walnuts, but they were easily pushed to the side, if thats not your cup of tea.  We will definately go again, next time we are in Vegas."
1584,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow big size plates... Very tasty food with actual flavor.. I had the basil chicken.. my other members in my family had the deep fried salmon.. and the steak...mmmmmm good baby..
1585,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I started with their specialty Bloody Mary, tasty and spicy.  Had a Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade with dinner and that was great.  Ordered the Butternut Squash and he had the Corned Beef sandwich with a side if mashed potatoes doctored with bacon and cheese.  All excellent.  My only change would be to skip the shrimp in my dish.  The flavor stars were by far the risotto and roasted butternut squash.  Good value for a great meal."
1586,Hash House A Go Go,5,Damn!  So much food!  You could easily share plates here!  Had a twisted burger with sweet potato fries!!  Delish!
1587,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go is a hidden gem in the Quad (formerly the Imperial Palace).  The hotel is a dump, and when you walk in, you think ""really""?

But once you get to Hash House - omg!  The food is amazing, the portions are huge!  Well worth it.

The BLT Bloody Mary with the bacon - yum!

If you don't have a big appetite, you can probably share.  

One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!"
1588,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Overall great dining experience before we leave Vegas. Our Server is very accommodating. We ordered their famous chicken and waffle, and Cobb salad, coffee with bailey from the Bar. Huge portions with nice flavor. Next time I will try their sexy leg drink because of the interesting glassware they use. Waffle is very good. Chicken is not oily and I like the ""Hays"" as well"
1589,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hash House is perfect fit for Vegas - oversized, excessive, indulgence but really the experience is just mediocre. 

Other than the size of the portions, I found nothing enjoyable.  I tried their signature sage fried chicken and waffles.  What a mess. The fried chicken was more breading than chicken and was rather flavorless and dry. And the waffle tasted stale.  The gratuitous piece of bacon inserted into the middle of the waffle added nothing to the dish. 

The restaurant is in a windowless room on the second floor of the old Imperial Palace. It was dark, dingy and slightly claustrophobic.   

This is one and done for me."
1590,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you stay at the Linq, you get to go downstairs and have Hash House A Go Go for breakfast. Get there early!

I did not like that they do not do any substitutes. Not everyone wants 16oz of potato mash... Some people like broccoli and carrots instead. I had to order it as an additional side."
1591,Hash House A Go Go,4,A bit of a wait to get seated but even longer to get a waitress and our drinks from the bar. Once everything got to the table it was more than enough and delicious! A tad expensive but you definitely get the amount of food you pay for.
1592,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came to Vegas for a wedding and decided to have breakfast here since seeing the reviews on help. There was about a 2min  wait as this place is very popular. I ordered the waffle breakfast comes with eggs ,
Potatoes and bacon or sausage. My company ordered pancakes and chicken and waffles. The food was ok. I think we were more fascinated by how big the portions were. We all could've shared one plate. I wouldn't mind returning here. But it definitely wasn't the best breakfast I've ever had. It gets crowded so plan to wait."
1593,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm currently in a food coma as I write my review so hopefully it all makes sense. 

Hash House was recommended by a few different friends and when we asked around about it everyone said the same thing, ""I hope you're hungry!"" Boy were they not wrong! 

When we arrived, the hostess told us it would be about a 45 minute wait which we didn't mind. So we took a seat and went over the menu while we waited. The menu is full of options so even the pickiest of eaters should find something. Almost 45 minuets on the dot we were seated. Since we had already looked over the menu we knew what we wanted when our waiter came around to introduce himself. 

Chicken & Waffles: voted a New York Times best. Comes with 2 huge pieces of fried chicken that sit on top of 4 square waffles (which have bacon inside of them), topped off with a twig of rosemary, sage and green onions. The presentation alone on this dish gets a 10/10! Now to taste, the fried chicken was crispy on the outside but the meat was very tender in the inside. The waffles had really good flavoring and were perfectly cooked, not overly crispy and not undercooked. The bacon was a nice touch and added an extra savory taste to the dish.

My mom ordered the apple cinnamon flapjacks. Comes with one GIANT pancake bigger than your head. The pancake itself has cinnamon in it while the apples are cooked on top of the flapjack. Needless to say she couldn't finish it all but enjoyed it and took the rest to have later. 

We also order a side of the crispy potatoes. As if we didn't have enough food already, let's add potatoes! They were more like homestyle fries. Not as crispy as I was expecting but still good! 

Food 9/10
Service 8/10"
1594,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Located inside the Linq, this great breakfast place can be a little tough to find if you don't know where to look for it, but trust me it is worth the search. This restaurant is best known for breakfast, but serves other meals as well. Be warned, the portions are unbelievably huuuuuuge, many of which can and should easily be shared! A nice variety of traditional and unique menu items. The brown sugar & banana pancake is as big as a small pizza and the chicken and waffles came as s a tower, with two large chicken breasts and a half dozen waffles on a platter. When we went there was a bit of a wait time, but the staff keeps things well-managed and the wait goes fast. Our waiter was knowledgeable and very friendly."
1595,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Totally forgot to write a review so thought it'd be good to do it now =)

Went here a couple weeks ago from a recommendation and boy was it worth it!

Well just be prepared to curtail from eating for like a month cuz that's how much food they'll be serving you per dish hah.

Seriously the troughs they give you are ginormous....we had to split our meals so many ways cuz we could not finish it all....good food though.....from the chicken and waffles, to the meatloaf......all quite tasty!!

Really hidden gem here...oh try their watermelon juice drinks......pretty durn tasticle!"
1596,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Open 24/7- this is your spot for drunk late night bfast food to soak up the alcohol and curb that hangover. This diner atmosphere has a menu of gluttonous and enormous portions. The service was great. It was packed at midnight. We got the herb fried chicken benedict, which is their best seller. It was good, but not my fab of the bunch. Next up herb fried chicken and waffles with syrup and fried leaks-this came out in a tower. It was good!! The unexpected fav was meatloaf someone ordered- initially i didn't want it, but get a taste and you cant stop. The gravy was lick the plate clean, not that we ever got to the see the plate on any of these dishes. Someone ordered the cheesecake- which was sort of caramel-ey flavored. It wasn't my fav, but the portion was generous enough for more than 3 people. Go hungry!"
1597,Hash House A Go Go,5,Couldn't be more happy & full with the breakfast. Food was excellent. Portion size is extremely large. Service was great!  Definitely going back before leaving Vegas!
1598,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent food. Well worth the 1 hour wait to be seated. They make everything from scratch so the wait time for the food was an additional 40 minutes. Don't let that deter you. Everything was absolutely awesome. We spent about $65 for 3 meals and a signature cocktail. Huge portions, way better than the buffets on the strip for less cost. Quality is top notch."
1599,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is delicious.  The portions are huge.  Big enough to share. The red velvet waffles are to die for.  Highly recommend this place.
1600,Hash House A Go Go,5,We absolutely loved it! The wait was very long.. 1 1/2 hr wait but it was worth it. I would recommend this if you go to Vegas!
1601,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best biscuits and gravy I've ever had
1602,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One word...WOW! This place definitely delivered! At first I was worried this place would be all hype and overpriced but I was wrong! It was pricey but for the portions you get, totally worth it! I ordered a pot pie and I'm still eating the left overs 2 days later! (Probably not the best idea but you get the picture). My mom ordered a pancake and that thing was the size of a medium pizza! I couldn't believe it. The mimosas were good too! Originally we tried ordering the regular sized for $9.99 but the waiter insisted we get the large, soooooooo we did (duh, it's Vegas ). Didn't realize the were $20 each until we got the check BUT the cute cups they came in totally made up for that. Check out the pics below and if you have a chance, stop by the Linq and visit Hash House A Gogo!"
1603,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Pretty good place given my menu options were limited. There was a 20 min wait even though the place was huge. The wait went by quickly than getting our food. Staff was friendly but, rushed. The serving was HUGE!!! We shared the Roasted chicken egg scramble. Pretty average but, glad it wasn't overly seasoned. I'm sure if I had ordered something more popular, it would of been great. You get your money's worth."
1604,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Was looking for a good place to eat breakfast at while in Vegas and man did this place not disappoint! My friend got the chicken and Waffles which towered to the sky! I ordered the Chicken Benedict which also came out looking amazing... We may have waited awhile to be seated and get our food, but it was WELL worth it!"
1605,Hash House A Go Go,4,"While I'm really not a huge fan of this place, I have to go ahead and give this place 4 stars anyways, for the GINORMOUS portions and unique, fun ambiance.

The food itself seemed pretty average to me, but I must admit that I had a true, legendary Las Vegas hangover on the Sunday morning that I went. The four stars, I hope, cancels out this possible bias. The portion sizes here cannot be beat. When I say the dishes here are ginormous, I really am understating it. This is a great brunch spot, and if you feel like sharing, one dish is MORE than enough.

The atmosphere is fun, and they do serve alcohol which is a plus. The service was great, and our waitress was super friendly. I will hope to come back at some point, and hopefully with no hangover. The prices here are dirt cheap for the quantity you get.

The wait does get long, as this is a popular place. Being that it's located in a casino, there's plenty to do during that time. Go ahead and try your luck at blackjack or roulette. Who knows, maybe it'll pay for the meal!"
1606,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Like most of  the Strip, Hash House A Go Go is a glitzy imitation of real things: of real food, of good service, of a real restaurant.  

Hash House... substitutes sound and fury for anything substantial.  Long waits, mediocre food, and bad service hardly merit a one-star rating.

The imitation chicken and waffles are laughably bad, though grandiose to be sure--oversized portions served on a giant platter.  Eggos are far better than the waffles I sampled, and the dessicated chicken proved barely edible.  The enormous pancakes fared just as poorly in my opinion.

If you want good chicken waffles (I'd say exceptionally good.) go to M&M Soul Food on Charleston in Las Vegas or Hard Knox Cafe at two locations in San Francisco.

As a matter of fact, if you want real food at all, stay clear of Hash House A Go Go."
1607,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Lil bit different than the last time I was here.....no selling of the bloody Mary's while you wait. Booooo! I just thought I'd ask about half portions but noooooo. Whatever, it kinda worked out, because it seems to me as if the portions were brought down a notch or two. But they can and should be shared. I had the smoked salmon egg white scramble with Brie cheese & griddles mashed potatoes.  It was ok but I should've gone with my first mind and got the chicken salad....next time, cause i will be back!"
1608,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Outstanding food, huge portions. Long wait but worth it. I had the mushroom, artichoke, spinach hash which was excellent. Bloody Marys were large and delicious."
1609,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're are starving and want a gigantic meal come here!!! First off we had to wait so they were rolling out some very good Bloody Mary's, which of course we both ordered one  Those drinks were delicious!!! The right combo of horseradish and spices, it was flavorful and had a good kick in it too. I could swear I was getting a pretty good buzz from just one cocktail.

After I roamed the menu and looking also around the room  I noticed how big the servings were coming out. The fried chicken with waffles that I saw come out to the table next to us was humongous!!! 

My daughter ordered the banana and brown sugar pancake and I ordered the fried chicken, mashed bacon potatoes with 2 eggs. My hubby was smart and didn't order a thing, as he knew his girl's wouldn't be able to put a dent in their meals. 

The waitress brought are good out with an extra plate. Let's just say the chicken was delicious. The 3 of us shared the chicken, potatoes and I split the eggs with my husband. We all three had some of the pancake, which we couldn't even eat half of it.

My tip to you is come very hungry and get ready to stuff yourself. Share the food, or you will be bringing home a big doggy bag."
1610,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Well, the wait for breakfast or anytime around checkout times is usually a bit crazy. Typically around 30min-1hr. Always worth the wait and the food is delicious. Burgers and sage fried chicken definitely a must."
1611,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg the banana brown sugar pancake! So good I went 2 of the 4 mornings I was in Vegas. The pancake is huuuugggeee and amazing, fluffy and the brown sugar add a nice texture/crunch with the banana. I can eat with the best of them and only ate about half a pancake. For two people I would suggest splitting the truckers breakfast (egg, meat and pancake) and adding a side of eggs or meat unless you are a world class eater. I'll be back next time I am in Vegas."
1612,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Would not let me leave zero stars.  Went to the location on Stephanie,  in Henderson Nv. 
Food was awful,  bland ,no seasoning what so ever. I had the chicken fried steak,  it was very tough and the breading just lifted off like it was cooked separate and laid on top.
Mashed potatoes looked like they were cooked 8 hours prior to our arrival. Green beans were okay as they were the only thing on my plate that had salt. Very disappointing since I had heard so many good things about the restaurant. 

Waitress must have noticed that I had only taken a couple of bites and refused a togo container but never asked if food was okay. 
Unacceptable."
1613,Hash House A Go Go,4,Come with an appetite because the food portions are humongous! We shared the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  2 large pieces of fried chicken breast on top of 4 waffles (filled with bacon).  We could not even finish it all.  Very reasonable prices but shared plates are charged $2.50 more.  Which is okay since I definitely would not have been able to eat my own plate.  The HH kiwi watermelon lemonade was also yummy.
1614,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Twisted Farm Food.. this place gets me every time I am in Vegas! The sage fried chicken on top of a tower (yes, tower) of bacon waffles, and topped with warm maple syrup... OH MAN! I have tried so many things on the menu, and they are all great! But the Chicken and Waffles have a special place in my heart and I get weak every time I walk in. That's not all.. they have the BEST Bloody Mary I have ever had! Perfect every time! Not a drinker? They have a s'mores mocha... the marshmallows are toasted and overflowing on top of the coffee mug! So many options.. its a great place to go!"
1615,Hash House A Go Go,5,Loved this spot. Sat at bar and service was great. Lucky because the wait was 40 minutes and was just happy to fill my belly with some grub.
1616,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is always amazing.  We've been to the San Diego location and most recently in Las Vegas.  If you want loads of delicious food and great brunch drinks, it's always worth the wait.  The biscuits and gravy are a must do!"
1617,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Located inside the LINQ hotel so it was convenient for us since that is where we stayed. The wait was not bad at all for Sunday brunch time. I ordered the salmon, brie scramble and absolutely loved it. The food and service was good and I would recommend this establishment."
1618,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ordered the Man V Food favorite: 

On the bottom, a thick bed of bacon mashed potatoes. On top of that a nice big biscuit covered with gravy. Then fresh spinach, tomatoes and thick cut bacon. Two fried chicken breasts smothered in mozzarella, and scrambled eggs on top, all drenched with copious amounts of gravy. It was outstanding. And no, I did not finish it. I left two slices of tomato uneaten. No sense being a damned pig about it."
1619,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place is basically a food factory and not very good if you like decent food and not just huge portions.

We waited about 30 minutes for a table at around 9AM. After being sat, the waiter was so busy because they sit people in one section all at once, that he basically explained the menu to like three tables at once. After he got done explaining the menu we ordered. I got the chicken and waffles based on the waiter telling me it was their most famous dish and my husband got the basic which is their standard breakfast. I also got a side of eggs.

The chicken and waffles looked really fun and cool, but the waffles were dry and left much to be desired. The fried chicken was pretty good out of everything we ordered, but needed some seasoning. The side of eggs I ordered was fried and over hard, they came with the yolks all over them, which is not what I wanted as I ordered them that way to avoid eating the yolk. They also were drenched in oil. My husband's breakfast was more standard, but also was huge and drenched in oil and nothing great about it.

This place wasn't worth coming to, let alone worth the long wait and high prices for breakfast."
1620,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was amazing ..big portions . .. Great service ...no waiting ... Fist time at this location ..
1621,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Everything about this place was amazing.  The portions are huge.  We went on a packed Tuesday morning, and we were seated promptly and got our food in probably less than 10 minutes.    The portions were so big, I didn't know where to start.  It was amazing, and definitely the #1 restaurant I recommend to people traveling to Vegas."
1622,Hash House A Go Go,1,Low quality huge portions burger 15 bucks ate 10 percent taste like a super big  Burger King burger chicken pot pie disgusting ate 5 percent 50 bucks for crap
1623,Hash House A Go Go,2,"After reading all the awesome reviews we decided to check out Hash House A Go Go. Let's start with the good. It's pretty nice that this place is 24/7 and we were looking for a place to eat after a night out. We took the escalator up to the second floor around 4am and sure enough they were open. They have a pretty standard diner menu but they are known for their massive portions. If you are looking to save some money most of their entrees are shareable. Now the bad, unfortunately this restaurant definitely caters to the drunk club crowd. It was so LOUD in there and they didn't even have that many people. So if you're not into loud, drunk people I would recommend coming during standard restaurant business hours. Also, we thought the food was just okay. Given the many other options for breakfast in Vegas I would definitely go elsewhere. I ordered the Tractor driver combo with pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancake was huge and probably the equivalent of a short stack of pancakes. Unfortunately they weren't very flavorful. I would go to IHOP for better pancakes. The bacon was also kind of meh. The eggs, however, were perfectly poached! My boyfriend ordered the farm scramble with bacon, avocado, onion and swiss cheese and he said it was just okay. His crispy potatoes that came with it weren't crispy at all. I guess perhaps we just ordered the wrong things since so many people are fans of this place."
1624,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Pros
The waitstaff helped us pull off the hub's surprise bachelor party

Portions: Ginormous. Gargantuan.

Egg white scramble with salmon, pesto and tomatoes was unreal. The flavor combo was outstanding. I wish I could have taken it home with me. 

Great drunk food.

Open pretty early/late

Cons
Long wait for seating and food but I'd go anyway!"
1625,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Be prepared to wait. Thankfully, they have a bloody bar to help make the wait less painful. And look at the menu so that you can order as soon as you sit down because ticket times are usually 40 minutes. I got the chicken scramble with crispy potatoes and a biscuit. SO MUCH FOOD. I ate until I was stuffed and it looked like I didn't even put a dent in it. Everything was delicious, my only complaint is that they made the scramble with dark meat chicken and I prefer white meat, but that's a personal preference and I couldn't really take off any stars for that!"
1626,Hash House A Go Go,3,Large portion....long wait line if you go at prime time......overrated food.  Besides the portions I didn't find it special or extra tasty....okay at best!
1627,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Was looking for somewhere to eat after our Male Review show. Remembered that this place place opens 24/7. Got there around 1030pm. Got seated right away not packed like i was expecting. I remembered the portion size was huge so we decided to share everything. Ordered Salmon, Ribs, Chicken and biscuits, Penne Pasta , and a couple Watermelon Kiwi Lemondes. Everything was fantastic. I ate so much i couldn't breath or move. Definitely coming back here whenever i'm back in Vegas!"
1628,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Mind. Blown.

Hash House a Go Go is a must-stop in Vegas - even more so if you're a breakfast lover. Come girded with that true American appetite because the hype, people, is real. 

Their famous Sage-fried Chicken and Waffles lived up to its glowing reputation, and I have to proclaim, it was probably the most memorable dish during my trip to the Strip. 

The presentation: epic...a tower...a Tower of freakin' Epicness. Four bacon-loaded waffles acting as the base, two perfectly fried, golden, crispy chicken breasts laid on top of each other, and to secure this mad chef creation to the plate, skewers of freshly pungent rosemary stalks right down the middle...Impressed yet?

However, do the taste and flavors match the in-your-face presentation? I'm happy to report that it's a resounding yes! The chicken was incredibly moist and juicy. The breading, perfect. Topping it all off with a drizzle of maple syrup creates the perfect marriage between sweet and savory. Can you say match made in food heaven?     

Gripes (I know, I know): The bacon-stuffed waffles were a bit on the dry side. However, they get points for creativity! 

Service and ambiance, however, weren't quite as outstanding. The waitresses were kind of rude and the restaurant can get pretty loud. 

A worthy spot, if you find yourself in the City of Sin. As a suggestion, I would recommend going earlier in the morning to beat the crowds - we arrived at 11 am but still had to wait 45 minutes till we got a table."
1629,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very good food.... DEFINITELY SHARE, because the portions are enormous!  Great service... only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was I wasn't a fan of the pork:(  But overall, VERY GOOD!"
1630,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Chicken and waffles, they are perfect combination in my eyes. And ever since I was introduced to Hash House A Go Go on an episode of Man vs. Food, I knew someday I would have to make a pilgrimage and tackle their ridiculous, over-the-top tower of chicken and waffles meant to feed a family of 4 but served to one person as their entree. Check that off the bucket list now.

Being a Monday afternoon, my buddies and I thought it would be a breeze to get in quickly for a table. But we would be wrong once we got to the top of the escalator and saw people lined up on the benches outside. I put my name on the list for an estimated 45 min wait. No matter, the craps tables downstairs would keep us busy in the meantime.

We made it just in time to hear our name called and sat down. No need glance at the menu. I wanted the famous Sage Fried Chicken stacked with bacon waffles, drizzled with hot maple caramel reduction, and crowned with fried leeks. I was the first to order at the table, but the final one to receive their food. Apparently, there were 5 other chicken and waffle orders ahead of mine. The wait was almost torture. 

The behemoth entree was finally brought before me and all I could say was ""Wow"". It was an impressive sight. A skewer and long knife stabbed through the top kept the whole thing upright. I removed both of them to break down the tower piece by piece. I have to say the chicken, two healthy thigh pieces, were succulent as hell. The batter with sage was crackly good. Very impressed. The waffles were OK. Bacon does make everything better but couldn't combat the somewhat dryness of the waffle. Some dousing of the extra maple reduction would help with that.

At the end, it was ""Veni, vidi, vici""."
1631,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great place for breakfast! Large portions with creative plating. I had the corned beef hash and it was homemade, not the canned stuff most places serve. This location was further away than I thought so if your on the strip, look for a closer location."
1632,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We decided to try Hash House a Go Go after reading reviews and were not disappointed! We tried this one, inside of the Linq, as it was closest to our hotel.
We each had 2 eggs, 2 sausage and french toast. So good and so much food that you can't eat it all! We also shared a biscuit, which was delicious! 
My husband had a tangerine mimosa (which he thought was too sweet) and I had a tangerine and honey screwdriver (2 actually) which was sooooo good!
We went to the original HHGG the next day and were disappointed in service.....definitely go to this one!"
1633,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've been here twice in my life. I don't remember what I ordered the first time. Its been years, but on my most recent visit, I ordered the 'Hashes - Chorizo, Jalapenos Cheddar Cheese and Fresh Tomato'. Talk about portions. They really live of up to the stereotypical american food portions. You can definitely share this dish with someone else. I ate more than half, but it was too the past the point of satisfaction. The food is delicious, and plus they stuff you up with some biscuits and syrup before you main course arrives. I love how they ask if you want dessert even after seeing you in your food coma state. I think they get a kick out of it when people say their version or 'no' in response. I would recommend people to come check this place out. I'm pretty sure on my first visit I ordered for myself and it seems i don't learn from my mistakes. Still worth it, but i got breakfast in the morning. =)"
1634,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place was ok I'm my opinion. We had to wait an hour to be seated then had to wait about another hour for our food to come out. I ordered the waffles and it was a good size, not sure i would split it since i don't think it was as much, however my hubs ordered something different and his plate was huge  it could easily feed to adults. Overall i recommend eating there at least once."
1635,Hash House A Go Go,1,"If I  can give this place a negative star I would ! Worst customer service ever ! It started out with a very friendly server (pj) . Ordered the steak and eggs meal , my eggs had a piece of hair on it . Steak was ordered medium rare but instead I got super cold still breathing rare. Told a server (bald and Hispanic ) that there was hair on  my food . He very angry snatched the plate off of our table ,didn't apologize or anything ! Food comes back 5 minutes later on the same plate . Still no apology for the   hair on the egg ! Girl servers comes over and just hands the food over .friend ordered corn beef meal and ordered sunny side up and eggs were frozen cold .  I was expecting   superb customer service since we've been to the one in San Diego and their food and customer service skills was  superb ! Very disappointed  over all with our experience here . Pj though was great and attempted to fix our bad expereinfe but that was impossible since he was the only one with any customer  service skills !"
1636,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hello fellow Yelpers!! This is my first  official Yelp review, so I thought that I would review a great place to eat in Las Vegas. This place is exceptional! The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Linq Hotel and Casino. As all paces are pretty much crowded on the Las Vegas strip, you can expect a bit of a wait. Although they were very busy the staff members were great and remained very attentive. The restaurant has many locations across the country and have become well known for their large portion sizes. Everything is huge!! Most options could be shared between two. I opted to try the chicken and waffles......phenomenal! The waffle was light and fluffy and the chicken breast was juicy and seasoned to perfection! I wanted to try the pancakes, as they are probably their best seller. However, my wife and I were stuffed! This is most certainly a great place to enjoy a meal after enduring the Las Vegas heat! Enjoy!!"
1637,Hash House A Go Go,1,"As a second time returning customer,  I couldn't have been more disappointed. The ticket times for both food and beverage were ridiculous. The server was in the weeds, due to the hostesses over-seating his section. The bussers wandered around aimlessly, while the m.o.d was careless and non-existent. My ticket, table for 2, entrees were delivered 20 minutes apart. The operation of this establishment is sloppy and embarrassing."
1638,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait was quoted @ 40mins around 1 in the afternoon but it seems as though we were seated quicker than expected. 

The server was above par. He was attentive and definitely aware of the his customers orders. I give him props because he looked as though his feet were aching but he kept pushing through. 

Seating arrangement is tight especially if one has long legs. 

Now the food, the waffles were just okay (3/5) without the syrup but as soon as I added the syrup my taste buds were pleased (5/5). 

The sausage was great. The eggs tasted as expected. The biscuit was good with the strawberry jam (oh so yummy). I would definitely go again. Last comment: the coffee is nothing special kinda watered down."
1639,Hash House A Go Go,5,Sage Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict Was Huge. Our server was excellent. She provided guidance on house specials along with other great suggestion. Come hungry or else bring home a doggie bag.
1640,Hash House A Go Go,2,Maybe I need to go back to the one off the strip. When I visited that location it was AMAZING. However I was terribly disappointed at the food at this location. The food was under seasoned. The service was slow. I won't be coming back here to eat anytime soon.
1641,Hash House A Go Go,3,"HUGE PORTIONS!!!

Long lines! Surprising since it is inside Imperial Palace, now the Quad. Service was good.

House Hash Roasted Chicken - $12.95 - Chicken was a bit dry and under seasoned. Veggies were cooked decent. Potatoes were crispy but had no flavor. Biscuit was fluffy.  

House Hash Corned Beef - $12.95 - Beef was good but could have been griddled more crispy. Cheese on top was melty. Potatoes were crispy but had no flavor. Biscuit was fluffy.  

Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles - $14.95 - Chicken was nice and crispy. Waffles have bacon cooked inside of them which was different and yummy. Needs a ton of maple sauce cause it gets to become dry really quick. 

Overall the food is typical huge brunch dishes that are cooked decently but are bland."
1642,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I am confused as to how this place gets such good reviews.  It is truly just an A-OK restaurant.  I definitely wouldn't come back with all the other options in Vegas.  Our food wasn't bad... it just wasn't awesome.  

The portion sizes are HUGE which would be great if I intended to eat my leftovers. But why would you eat leftovers when you're in Vegas?  We got both a spicy hash and a blueberry flapjack.  Both were fine.  It left us satisfied to the say the least.

I will have to warn you:  DO NOT ORDER COFFEE.  It tasted burned and was practically undrinkable.  If there's no line, go for it.  But not really worth a wait more than 30 mins."
1643,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is everything you want a family style Vegas restaurant to be: indulgent, laid back, and friendly. We started off by ordering the HH S'mores Mocha. It was fab at the top where there was an inch of torched marshmallow, but past that, the mocha was pretty average. To eat, we got Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which was featured on Man v. Food. It was massive and overwhelming but we powered through it. Unfortunately, there was so much going on that it was difficult to tell what was the bread of the chicken and what was the chicken itself. The true star of the meal was the Brown Sugar Banana Flap Jack. The flap jack's size was so impressive that it's difficult to imagine anyone actually ""flipping"" it in the kitchen. It was perfectly crusted with brown sugar and thick banana cuts. After finishing both plates the server said she was ""impressed,"" which made us feel...fat...but accomplished."
1644,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had tried to come in for lunch but it was smack in the middle of lunch rush on Saturday and opted not to wait an hour for a table. Instead, we came back that evening for dinner. Ambience is very casual for a place where the food can actually get pretty pricey. However, it is very good, and the portions are TREMENDOUS (we made one giant to go box and gave it to a homeless man on the strip). 

Fiancee ordered the chicken and waffles and could barely eat half of it. I myself had the blackened chicken skillet and only made my way through 3/4. Chicken was nice and tender for both our entrees. Friends ordered the NY Strip and it was actually a very impressive steak for a place like this. 

Service was so-so but we didn't expect a whole lot so not a big deal."
1645,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food portions are enormous! Very good food and fast service.  Will definitely be going back to Hash House A Go Go!
1646,Hash House A Go Go,2,Too much too much food. Had the waffle and chicken. Shared with wife. It was still a lot of food. Expect to wait a long time to be seated.
1647,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I find myself craving the griddled mashed potatoes from this Linq diner every time I come to Las Vegas.  Yum, yum, yum.  And it's open 24/7?  Oh yeah, I'm there!

Expect a long wait (unless you're Diamond or Seven Stars.  Then to the front of the line you go!), but it is so worth it.  Trust me.  Your hangover won't be that mad at one once you get sit down and get your mountain of food.

Yes, the portions are HUGE, but if you think I'm splitting my brunch with you, you've got another thing coming!  I typically get the crab cake benedict, which is two huge lumpy cakes on top of a biscuit, on top of griddled mashed potatoes, topped with a heavenly hollandaise sauce that'll make you want to slap your mama.  And then slap her again because it's just that good (sorry Mama, I love you!)

The service has always been great, although this isn't a place where you're coming for the service.  You're coming because you saw that guy on TV that ate the monster chicken and waffles.  DUH!  

The prices are about $15-20 a person, which is a steal considering how much you get.  Stay away from the expensive drinks and you should be okay."
1648,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Cane here when visiting Vegas based on recommendations and awesome Yelp reviews! I was not disappointed in the slightest! 5 of us had a wait for around 45 min Sunday for brunch at 1130 which isn't terrible in my opinion. 
They had Bloody Mary and mimosa service while you waited for the table so I had two delicious bloody Mary's and highly recommend them! 
Once we say I ordered the chorizo skillet that was so much food I couldn't even finish it. If and when I return to Vegas I'm coming here and getting the chicken and waffles because it's my weakness and my friend devoured it with very good compliments. 
Definitely recommend this place. Just be prepared to wait on the weekend and pay around 20ish an entree"
1649,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Not a long line at 9:45 am and got in within 10 minutes. Friendly service, nice atmosphere, and some great options for food. I had a hard time choosing. One of many things would have been great. I got the Tractor Drive special. The pancake was soooooo big. I recommend this place."
1650,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food: good and big portions

Service: OK, went there 9am sat down, ordered, a couple came after us , ordered, got their waffle&chicken 5 mins before our food was served.

Ambiance: OK, nothing special. (the one in LINQ hotel)

Will go back again, but a different location."
1651,Hash House A Go Go,1,"My wife and I had the salmon and asparagus eggs Benedict and the Dave's chicken Benedict and we were very disappointed.   The servings were huge but sometimes less is more.   I don't write many negative reviews but I don't see what everyone is ravings about.  Our bill was $57 with coffee, two breakfasts and one bloody Mary.  I'm sorry but wouldn't eat there again.  McDonald's actually sounded good after that meal."
1652,Hash House A Go Go,4,Filling and good and delicious.  Quick service.  Wait was about 20 minutes.  Had the chicken omeltte with avocado.
1653,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have never been to a restaurant with portions as huge as Hash House's. The food is worth the price. My boyfriend and I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict as our entree and the crab cake pasta as an appetizer, and shared to get the most out of our visit. They also give you gigantic biscuits that also taste good. We still ended up having to bring our entree to go as leftovers because it was so much but it was soooo good."
1654,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We came here for lunch when we were visiting the city due to the yelp reviews. The wait was about an hour long, but worth it. The staff was super friendly and everyone was super welcoming.

Our waiter was super helpful and gave us some popular options. The food came out super quickly despite the long wait. The portions were huge. We ordered the chicken and waffles and it could have easily fed four people. It came with four bacon waffles and two huge pieces of chicken. 

The waffles were super fluffy and slightly sweet with some saltiness due to the bacon strips. The chicken was fried to perfection. The chicken itself was super juicy and flavorful while the batter was crispy and lightly seasoned. 

We would definitely come here again if we ever come back to Vegas. Luckily for me however, they opened up a Hash House in Dallas so yay."
1655,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is a solid choice for a 3AM breakfast.  The portions are way more than any person needs. Everyone was really happy with the food ordered.  The eggs, biscuits and gravy were very good, just didn't understand it sitting on top of a large pile of mashed potato.  I was really looking forward to the bloody mary to give me a couple more hours of energy, however it was the blandest bloody mary.  No amount of hot sauce, pepper or salt could fix it.  Late night, i'll give this place another try."
1656,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So happy they keep this place open with the new hotel. I love having breakfast hear. its all about the hash. i had eggs, hash and potatoes. all good. the food the service and the drinks."
1657,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go?  Portion Control A No No!

Hash House A Go Go is famous for their massive portions and delicious sage chicken and waffles.  This restaurant has been on my Vegas restaurant bucket-list for a couple trips already and only this most recent time visiting the City of Sin did I muster enough morning appetite to check this place out.

Just a skip and a hop from the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, Hash House is located in the Quad within the Linq Promenade.  Unfortunately, we went at prime brunch hour (10:30 AM), so the wait was about 45 minutes.  Not to worry, this is Vegas!  We ended up just ""waiting"" at the bar downstairs...

Once seated, we didn't even have to look at the menu to know what we wanted: mimosas and sage chicken & waffles, please!

The mimosas were weak and overpriced, but kept our morning fun going.  And the chicken and waffles still haunt me in my dreams!  Waffles crispy on the outside, soft and light on the inside, topped with a mountain of sauteed onions and crispy fried chicken, juicy in each bite, and slathered with gooey delicious maple syrup.  And the portions?  HUGE.  My friend and I split a plate, had leftovers, and were still beyond stuffed!  

Granted, this was my first time trying a chicken & waffles dish, but Hash House A Go Go definitely set the bar high!

Open 24/7, maybe I'll try an off-peak hour next time!"
1658,Hash House A Go Go,3,Ordered the Stuffed Cheddar burger and fries.  Fries were good and the burger was ok..  typical greasy spoon with OK service as well.  The great thing about this place is it's open 24/7.
1659,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Honestly I had heard so many good things about this place, it was impossible not to be let down by the food, which was about the same quality as a Denny's. The menu was fairly large but I had trouble finding anything that looked appetizing. Not my type of place."
1660,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge portions, perfect hangover food, but the service was less than attentive. I'd go back bc the food helped clear up my hangover."
1661,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I am going to start off by saying that the biscuits were nothing short of phenomenal. They were by far the best biscuits I have ever had. The potatoes were up there also. 

I really love breakfast, but at the same time feel as though there are only so many ways you can cook an egg. Nevertheless, I felt breakfast here exceeded expectations by a mile. My wife had french toast with pecans on top and I almost never taste her food. It was so tasty. I had the Farm Scramble w/ roasted chicken, fresh corn, roasted red pepper, & mozzarella (also tasty).

If you are expecting a quiet atmosphere, soothing music, and white table clothes during breakfast (or any other meal because they serve more than just breakfast), you've barked up the wrong tree. If large portions, fun wait staff and filling drinks are your thing, this will more than meet your expectations. It's more expensive than your local Denny's (which is up the strip), but it's Vegas... would you expect anything else?!

1662,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I visited Las Vegas during the Thanksgiving Holiday we stayed at the Flamingo. However,  the Linq hotel is right next door. We went to Hash House ( recommend by many) in the Linq hotel which is the floor above the casino. The wait was tremendous. We played some black jack while we waited over an hour. In our minds it was worth it because of what we heard. I gave it 4 stars only because of the wait and how long it took for the food to come out. The food was perfectly seasoned, uniquely plated and had huge portions. The sage fried chicken and waffles..uggh bacon was baked inside the waffles....huge slices of bacon. It was amazing. So much food. Either us us could finish half of our plates. The best part is that this restaurant is farm to table. #freshfood"

Because I wanna go too.  I love this place.  I love the name, I love the food, and I love the attitude.

The Name:
Okay, surely the name is a double entendre.  Yes, they are famous for the hash mixtures of potatoes and eggs mixed with vegetables and corned beef (or other protein choices).   All delicious, I'm sure.  But what about the other hash?  Why don't they just come out and call it Chronic a go go?  On second thought, maybe that name wouldn't fly.

The Food:
It's described as twisted farm food.  Genius.  Hash House a go go takes heartwarming comfort food and gives it a crazy twist.   Want fried chicken and waffles?  Consider the Sage Fried Chicken stacked with a Bacon Waffle, hot maple caramel reduction sauce and crowned with fried leeks.  Yummy, a bit off kilter from expected and oh so delicious.  And there's plenty more choices where that came from.

The Attitude
The menu, the place, the staff are all a bit funky and quirky.  Love the sassy boldness of the place."
1664,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We waited for about an hour to get seated so this place is a very popular spot. We ordered their famous Andy's Chicken Fried Benedict platter - it was the size of a mountain! It looked very appealing but flavors were very generic with lots of filler ingredients .ie. Mash potatoes and biscuit.  I gave Hash House 2 stars because their staff was very well trained and attentive. If you are interested in just a place to fill up on nutrients than its a decent place. If you are looking for quality with flavors, I suggest investing your time at another eatery."
1665,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This review is solely on the service and wait. I still gave them three stars because as we were waiting, we saw guests leaving very satisfied and saying ""worth the wait...delicious food...I'm stuffed."" Unfortunately, we never made it in.

Sooo I knew we were going to have to wait a while because it was packed and we were a party of 8. The hostess said it would be about an hour and a half. So we waited...and waited...

Meanwhile, a big party that checked in after us got seated before us. 

But we waited some more...and waited.

Finally, one of us went to ask the hostess how much longer it would be. She told us 30 on top of how long we already waited. So we decided to wait an extra 30 since we were so close!!

We waited...and waited. 30 minutes went by and they still didn't call is. Another one of us went to double check if it would be soon. We were all getting very hungry. 

And this time the hostess told us 45 minutes!!! And we told her that someone had told us 30 minutes ago, that it was 30 minutes. She just looked at him and said it would be ABOUT 45 more minutes.

Needless to say, after losing over two hours of our day on just waiting to get in..we gave up and went somewhere else.

It was pretty upsetting because I was looking forward to eating here after reading reviews and hearing such satisfaction."
1666,Hash House A Go Go,5,Glutinous.  In the best way.   Loved our meal and drinks here.  Chicken and waffles are enormous.
1667,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My wife said the biscuit was the best she ever ate. We shared a bone-in ribeye which was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Lovely fresh carrots, asparagus and green beans and crispy frites sealed the deal.  Two can share 1 dinner with no problem.  Our sever, Steven was very sweet, engaging and attentive.  The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is that it REEKS  of cigarrette smoke.  The restaurant is non-smoking but the casino downstairs is smokers' paradise.  There are other Hash Houses in LV.  We may go there next time, but then we wouldn't see Steven."
1668,Hash House A Go Go,2,"If you just want large portions and need to soak up the alcohol, go here. If you want something good and worth the money, find something else.

Ordered a drink and never received it. 
Waitress was okay, but not great for how busy the place was not.

Came in the morning and the wait was ridiculous so we came back after some activities later in the night/early morning. 

Maybe they are better in the morning"
1669,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Buyer beware: They sit large parties first, regardless of the order your party (under 6) came in. Not a surprise; they can do it because of the demand. Expect to wait longer unless you want to make friends and make a larger party. Lol.

Not surprisingly, there is no manager or assistant manager on staff to discuss this with. 

For service, I give them no stars. Their food is another matter. Just be prepared to wait and to hear, ""just another 20 minutes"" over and over again."
1670,Hash House A Go Go,4,"What can I say?  I love this place.  You have to share because portions are way too big. My husband loves the chicken and waffles.  For me, waffles are never hot enough unless you make them yourself.  I'm picky about hotness.  It's fun to try new things here and share.  For my taste, the pancakes are too thick and dry."
1671,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I ordered Chicken & Waffels, it was cold. I don't see what the big deal of this place is. Our waiter was bad. He forgot my husbands order. He ordered The Basic, which is eggs, bacon, and potatoes. The potatoes were over cooked, and dry & near burned. I was very dissapointed since the restaurant was recommended by a friend and seems to get good reviews. I don't think I will be going back."
1672,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Rock solid food, amazing service, not a fan of the construction noise while eating but that is the proce of progress. I am sure I will be back here once the expansion dies down."
1673,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great service, large portions and really tasty food. I think these guys are actually known for their large portions, because well, I think they we're on DDD for this and they try to make their food look huge, with stems of rosemary sticking out of their dishes. What's sad is that I see half the plate being sent back routinely. But maybe the bums benefit from this?? Anyhow, we love leftovers, so we don't send food away and this was sum yum food. I imagine we would come here for brunch routinely, because breakfast is served all day, if we lived here. Their savory dishes are infused with garlic and rosemary oils. I recommend the Chicken Hash that has Asparagus, Sage, Peppers, and Onions. Comes with fresh biscuit with homemade Strawberry Preserves. 

The one thing we were not crazy about was the ambiance. It is a punk, rocker place, which is fine if you are punk rocker, but it doesnt have natural light and it is noisy. But we would still come back. We know what to expect now."
1674,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash house a go go there now if you're feeling some down to earth southern food with portions to match. 

I didn't get the hash there, but I'm sure it's pretty good."
1675,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came to eat here on a weekend I was in Las Vegas , and let me say that I was really Wowed at my experience I had here ..
I got to the restaurant early sunday morning, unfortunately there was a 45 minute wait and I managed to be seated in less than 30min DONT LET THE LINE FOOL YOU! 
I got seated and greeted by our server Abby and she was simply the best. It was my first time there and she was kindful enough to go over the cramped menu with me and share some of her personal favorites.
Drinks came fast .. food was on point.. nice environment.. definitely coming back !"
1676,Hash House A Go Go,4,Come here with an appetite because the portions of food are ginormous. It was a treat watching the food come out and watching the look on peoples faces. I would say that most of the dishes here can be split with a friend.  My breakfast was pretty delicious. My friend ordered a chicken pot pie dish that came in a hat shaped cracker. It was oozing with a creamy gravy.  It was very good.  I did have to send my hash browns back because they were cold and bit soggy but then they just brought more and I had a ton more hash browns. They were much better HOT.  The waiter was really passionate about the food and very nice.  I saw drinks on the menu that I would have tried that were extremely pricey. There was a bloody Mary drink on the menu that comes with Bacon and it was like $15.  I do not care if it had a souvenir glass I would never pay that much for that drink. I mean nothing that special about it.  I think if  you order a regular Bloody Mary and put your own piece of Bacon from breakfast you would have the same effect for half the price.  :-)   We did wait awhile as expected but it was worth the wait.  I definitely recommend this place.
1677,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Waited 30 mins for drinks and never got a refill, steak came well done not medium. Worst service in Vegas."
1678,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yummm! Came for breakfast on a whim when in Vegas.  My friend had seen it on the tourism channel at the hotel.  We had about a 35minute wait, well worth it!  The food is huge - TOO huge, yes. BUT delicious! So often you got a lot and it sucks, but this was great!  We ate until we couldn't eat any more, but weren't sick, just super full.  Basically, we weren't hungry for about 8 hours! More time to visit!

My friend had the buttermilk pancake with toasted coconut - DELICIOUS! The pancake was HUUUUGGEE!

I had the hash with artichoke, sun dried tomatoes, mushroom, and spinach.  It came with eggs (I had over easy) and a biscuit. I ate about HALF! 

My gf had the hash with salmon and cream cheese; also YUM!

If I went back we would def split and get an extra biscuit. But for the quality and quantity, $14 bucks is not too bad! Also: lemonade and pineapple mimosas are YUM!"
1679,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Coming to this place was a mistake. Slow service, cold food and unexpected extra charges made this one of the worst breakfast experiences I've ever had.

As soon as I set foot in the dingy dining room, I knew I'd made a mistake. It took 10 minutes for my waiter to come over. He was friendly enough, but when he cheerfully informed me that my meal came with a biscuit, and did I want a side of homemade gravy with it, I had no idea I was about to get screwed. I assumed it came with the meal. I'm not even that big on gravy but said, ""what the hell."" Turns out that gravy is $4.50. Thanks waiter for nicely gouging me.

The meal took a very long time to come. I ordered one of their hash breakfasts, assuming they must make some good hash. What I got was not corned beef hash but pulled pork. Stringy, thick, very hard to chew. And cold. Eggs were cold too. Potatoes were ok. Biscuit sucked. My $4.50 gravy was unimpressive and I barely touched it. The coffee was good, though I had trouble flagging someone down for a refill.

So please, skip this place. There's a Denny's nearby.

Oh, and nice of the manager to apologize, but I will never set foot in here again."
1680,Hash House A Go Go,4,"What a great find at 11pm in the night in Vegas. I believe they are open 24/7. Food comes out in large portions so one dish can be shared by 2 people. The sausage gravy with biscuits was unexpectedly delicious. Our server was very friendly and accommodating. When back in Vegas, we shall revisit."
1681,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was tasty.  Has the chorizo skillet.  Potatoes were the best ""home fries"" i have ever had.  Sausage was great.  Guy next to me had french toast and said it was ok.  He also had a piece of fried chicken with 1 bite taken out of it - he said it arrived stone cold.  Bartender more or less ignored everyone at the bar except for a group of guys at the end being very loud.  Had to ask to have my coffee refilled every time i needed more (very small coffee mugs).  Coffee is not great.  They do have ""to go"" cups of coffee.  Lady next to me ordered right after I did (Tractor driver combo) and i had finished and left before she got it.  She had to ask where it was and I did not see it show up before i left."
1682,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went here for breakfast on the day after Christmas. Had the sausage pot pie, OMG it was ginormous... how could anyone eat this meal. First of all it was in a deep dish bowl the crust looked like a 12 inch saucer with a 5 inch bowl in the middle, The bottom of the bowl was filled with mashed potatoes with the crust half way in the bowl with sausage with gravy filled in it and scrambled eggs on top. I wasn't able to finish even half of it. It probably could have fed 3 people... Go there if you haven't eaten in a few days...."
1683,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food was great, large portions. Warm honey butter biscuits were tasty. Only downside is restrooms are downstairs in the casino."
1684,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Travis the server made our breakfast even better. The breakfast alone speaks for itself , but when you have someone who knows everything about the menu and goes into great detail,  it makes it even harder to decide on what to have. That's a good thing. Thanks again for you great service."
1685,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Yuck food is not all that ,thought I would try it to see what the hype was . I went and did not see anything special I wanted hash browns none want bacon crispy nope got it soft and cold . Don't waste your money to eat there unless you wanna be in a clic"
1686,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Absolutely incredible from beginning to end!!! Food, service, and overall experience was top notch."
1687,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing ,amazing ,amazing Breakfast !!!!!
Did I say amazing ??? We had the chicken Benedict today going back tomorrow to try the granola blue berry pancake ...
Holy guacamole these are huge portions for the love of god share with one or two people... let's put it this way the show man verses food was here..
The food was so so so very good. 
Service was fast  and the place was nice and clean...."
1688,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here with my sister's Bachelorette Party, hungover and hungry before we headed back home.  We waited for about almost an hour.  It was super crowded and i had heard TONS of rave reviews about this place so i just had to taste for myself.

Once we were seated, the waitress explained that everything is made fresh to order so it might take some time for our food to come out.  Actually, it didn't take long at all, even tho the place was packed with people.  

I ordered the apple baked pancakes that had huge slices of green apple baked into the pancakes... DELISH!!  Another person in our party ordered the Fried chicken and waffle and it looked like an artful masterpiece!  SO TASTY!!  My sis ordered the breakfast quesadilla that she loved.  Portions are HUGE here so guaranteed you will not finish what you order.  But that's a good thing, cuz you get to have it again later (which you will definitely want again)

This place is SO worth the wait!!  Definitely stop here the next time you are in SIn City."
1689,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Husband and I were craving a good breakfast and it was after 11am. I enjoyed the goat cheese/ sundried tomato/ basil scramble w/ their crispy yum potatoes which had lots of diced red onions and bell peppers mixed in.  Loooved it!  My jaw dropped when I saw my husband's plate of monster pancake w/ blueberries and candied walnuts. I actually said, ""Holy sh--""  as a genuine response to it. Plenty of good coffee and attentive service as well. The place was hopping and there was a 20 min wait before we got seated.  
Was surprised that this popular spot is located up some escalators inside the Imperial Palace Casino. Don't think we would ever have found it otherwise if it weren't for Yelp. Would definitely come back to try some other items."
1690,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Actually really enjoyed this place!

If you plan to come between 10 AM - 1 PM make a reservation, otherwise you'll have to wait a bit. However, we were quoted 45 minutes for two of us and I think it ended up only being about 30. The place is big and they turn tables quickly. Plus, you can order a cocktail while you wait. I ordered the regular bloody mary and it was spicy and delicious!

For my meal, I chose the avocado, swiss, bacon, and onion scramble and thought it was really good! The bacon was super crispy and not fatty at all. And there was lots of yummy swiss cheese. But the standout for me was the biscuit! I think many of the dishes come with it, but I would definitely say keep an eye out. My husband got the chorizo, cheddar, and jalapeno scramble, which was huge! It came in a full on skillet. He also gave it rave reviews.

I would say this is the perfect place for a no frills, tasty hangover breakfast or late night meal. Yum!"
1691,Hash House A Go Go,3,Was not very happy. The service was terrible. The food was so so. Our waiter never once came back to check on us. Our food was cold and couldn't even send it back because he never came to check on us. And it wasn't even crowded. Feel like we wasted our time and money.
1692,Hash House A Go Go,1,Straight RUDE servers and host fucked up my meal and couldn't even make it better went hid in back had some other lame try fix it but F it up even more who doesn't know how to put in order over hard eggs no cream cheese and didn't want bring me a new plate F you mtf paying $85 for crap all looks ALLL LOOKS NASTY FIRST AND LAST ITZ HYPE DRUNK PEOPLE FOOD
1693,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I like the food. Very much a comfort food. They brag on their portions, which they are correct on. Almost too large of portions, felt wasteful."
1694,Hash House A Go Go,4,Seriously the best chicken and waffles I've had. Portions are massive so I recommend sharing. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
1695,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food was amazing! I went for Breakfast and the portions are crazy big and perfect for sharing. WIll be returning next time I am in Vegas!
1696,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a must eat when in Vegas and has been for every trip I have made. Both times I have gotten the sage fried chicken, once atop an eggs benedict and most recently as the famous chicken and waffles. I highly recommend the chicken and waffles, it's all sorts of food goodness. There's bacon infused in the waffles, the chicken is juicy, fried with corn flakes and drizzled with a hot maple reduction, and topped with fried leeks. Awesome!  A+ for the bloody mary BLT which came topped with an actual make your own BLT, which was a perfect snack while waiting for our food."
1697,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Monstrous proportions, excellent tasting food, and cheaper than most places in Vegas. What more do you need?"
1698,Hash House A Go Go,4,we loved the place and the bloody marry is awsome
1699,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We really enjoyed our experience! No wait around midnight-- walking to our table, we noticed the portions of other customer's platters--they are monstrous! 

Fried Chicken Benedict: WOW! The sauce that's on there... amazing! And definitely enough for two! Definitely worth a try!

Sage chicken and waffles: There were whole pieces of bacon but the waffles were soggy . The syrup wasn't your average syrup, it had all sorts of seasonings in it... Hmm now wondering if they had the good ol' plain syrup, (we tried to stay on the adventurous side since... this is Vegas, that's probably the sage)! 

Caesar salad with chicken: Just like one would expect an average Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Although, the croutons do have a twist, they're cubed pieces of soft cornbread, so I didn't get that ""crunch"" that I was looking for. But again, a large portion! 

After we ordered, complimentary biscuits were placed on the table, also yummy! Sweet on the outside! 

Overall, I would definitely comeback! To all, enjoy and good luck!"
1700,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You gotta try this place out when you're in Vegas!!

My roomies and I wanted to check hash house a go go. Heard that the food was delicious!! This place was pack!! Popular joint for tourists and locals. Our wait was about 20-30 mins.  We had asked the hostess if we can look at the menu so we know what to order. We had ordered 2 chicken and waffles, french toast, a giant pancake so sorry dont remember the name and I had gotten the vegetarian meal it was spinach, and mushroom hash.

chicken and waffle- Was delicious. The waffle had bacon pieces yummy!!
French toast- didnt get to try it but it does look delicious!!
Pancake- Looks delicious
Mushroom, spinach- Delicious, the potatoes was dry but still edible.

Service wasnt too bad!!"
1701,Hash House A Go Go,4,1st place we stopped in Vegas as we arrived super early in the morning. It was jamming at 7:30am in the morning. I ordered a BLT Bloody Mary it was honestly not good. I took two sips and did not drink anymore of it. I would pass on that. My husband had the hash and I had the man vs food chicken dish. Both were huge and very tasty. They definitely push the man vs food meal and the chicken and waffles. The sauce on my meal was awesome it's a chipotle cream sauce it was so good. My husband added the sausage gravy to his biscuit and that was really good too. A must try in Vegas!!
1702,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A few friends and I decided to get a late-night meal here after a long drive. The portion sizes here are insane. I got the chicken and waffle plate here for ~$20 and couldn't finish it all. 

The quality of food wasn't exceptional and you can get tired of it pretty quickly because there's so much of it. Service was alright at best; I don't know if it was because of the time we went or because it's simply LV, but there wasn't anything impressive here. 3.5/5 for portion size."
1703,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG ! 
This place was the shit ! Got recommended by a friend , and im glad we went ! I had the steak and eggs ! Didn't leave anything in the plate ! My friend ordered chicken & waffles and I even got try some of his plate . The waffles had cooked bacon on the inside ! The only thing that I didn't like was the 1hr wait . But after we ate we were glad we waited !"
1704,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place was voted best breakfast in Vegas multiple years in a row. Pretty sure most, maybe all the votes were from hungover folks. 

First you wait about 25 minutes.  The wait gets you pumped up and excited. You decide to go with their signature dish and get a hash. Then you wait 15 minutes for the said food to show up. Massive portions in a skillet. I can empathize with the look of disappointment on your face as you realize the hash is flavorless and the biscuit is as hard as a rock. Certainly not my idea of good breakfast either. 

Save your hard earned money and go somewhere else. This place just didnt cut it for me at all."
1705,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hands down this place is amazing!!! Most def coming here every time I come to Vegas. I had the chicken Benedict and barely ate a corner of it before I was full. The portion is ridiculous. I recommend going half on a plate with whoever you come with cause you for sure gonna take your food home... there banana latte and hot chocolate was delicious too
1706,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Can we say Holy Portions Batman... I can eat..and this was too much for me. Great price for the amount of food. 

Service was excellent as well. We enjoyed the laughs. A+

If your hungry.. this is the place to be"
1707,Hash House A Go Go,1,"You had me at: inconveniencing the bartender by asking for a fork to eat my breakfast with, and walking to the end of the back and taking cocktail napkins so I had a napkin. I'm sorry I was so demanding and needed silverware.  

You got me back by making me wait with my bill and credit card in hand for 15 minutes, while you waited on every one else around me.  Thank you."
1708,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is the second Hash House I have eaten at.  I gave the original in San Diego 5 stars because of its service.  Came in at 9 AM on a Saturday with a line and there were open seats because not enough servers on there.  Although, I think it is also reasonable to expect that this location customer service will not be as good as there other locations.  Had the Chicken and Waffles with a biscuit and i loved it!  Food wise, always a 5!  Also come hungry and you will always leave full."
1709,Hash House A Go Go,3,Meeericaaaaaa! This place does it big.  The pot pie was disgustingly huge and starchy.  Too many potatoes. No distinct flavor. This place is quantity over quality.  The service was spot on but I will never come back
1710,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went here with some friends for breakfast after a late night out. We arrived shortly before 10am and the place was packed. We had a party of three and it took about 30 minutes to be seated so be prepared to wait.

For my meal, I got the meatloaf hash. It was a large portion (as many people mention here), but I have to say it was quite lackluster. The food was very average in taste and even the ""hash"" was disjointed. All of the items seemed to be placed in the skillet randomly and didn't really have a tie together.

Overall, this place is pretty pricey, you have to wait a long time and the food is very average. Sorry to say, this place is not worth the hype."
1711,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great breakfast spot! The portions are HUGE, so I recommend sharing. My group had the French toast, classic breakfast, and the chocolate chip pancake; it was all delicious. Definitely come here with an empty stomach!"
1712,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Yep, portions are indeed GIANT. Take a look around, and you will see flapjacks the size of tires. Between three ladies, we had two entrees and that was entirely too much! We shared some sage chicken and waffles and the chorizo ""house hash"", which was actually quite spicy. Given that I was raised on Southern food, it was definitely not the best chicken I've ever had in terms of juiciness or flavor, and the waffle didn't really impress me either. I thought both were a little bit dry. I enjoyed the chorizo house hash more (topped with eggs), and the ""side"" of mashed potatoes was good. 

We ended up with enough food for four people, easily, and I thought the prices were very reasonable for Las Vegas. I was really curious about the mega-flapjacks, but that would have been a mistake. The wait time was very minimal even around 11:30 (prime brunch time!), perhaps 5-10 minutes."
1713,Hash House A Go Go,5,Located in The Linq hotel/casino. Several friends recommended this place. Wait was maybe 25 mins. We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles and French Toast. Both are SO darn good!  Definitely a great spot! Only issue is we didn't have cell phone service in casino or restaurant.
1714,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Good service and well-prepared food. We enjoyed their bacon waffle and omelet. Located inside The Quad Resort & Casino, which is undergoing major renovations now. Recommend valet parking. Large portions, so go there hungry!"
1715,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love this place! The menu is really creative. The portions are huge.
Reminds me of when you go to grandma's and she takes everything out of the frig to make breakfast and you are thinking....i dont know about that combination....and you walk away saying, wow those were the best eggs that i ever ate!!
I ordered corned beef hash, which was with eggs, avocado, onions and cheese. Homemade biscuits and homefries. AMAZING!!"
1716,Hash House A Go Go,4,loved this place... everything is sooo big and yummy ... their coffee and biscuits are to die for!!!!
1717,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great place for a great quality meal for great prices. Huge portions but the taste is not compromised. Service is great. Be prepared for a long line but it is worth the wait. We went twice. Once after 10am and waited 20 min or so. The next time before 9 and were seated immediately. Great service both times. Definitely recommend for families or groups. Get the banana brown sugar pancake, awesome!"
1718,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food is well worth the wait. The place was swamped and ticket times were 35min, but the food was amazing!

Farmhouse food at its finest. I enjoyed an angus scramble with crispy potatoes. It was enough food for two. (We saw many platters go by that looked like they could feed four.)"
1719,Hash House A Go Go,3,Huge portions and it was good but not worth the wait. They underestimated our wait by a good 45 minutes for a total of about an hour forty. Thats for two of us. Meanwhile large groups of six or more were seated right away. Total bullshit. Plenty of better spots in Vegas with much less of the BS.
1720,Hash House A Go Go,5,I have had many people tell me to try this place the next time we went to Vegas.....I am SO glad I did!!! 5 stars is not enough.....Bloody Mary's = fantastic;  Hash = Fantastic;  scrambles = fantastic; biscuits =fantastic!!!  We got there around 930am on a Sat and had only a 5 min wait...by the time we left - an hour later ----the wait was over 90min. Well worth it!!!! ENJOY!!!!!
1721,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The servings are enormous and gorgeous. It's very tasty - I give it 5 stars because of the portion, mostly. How can fried chicken and waffles be bad? Hard to mess those up. Definitely worth a visit if you're very hungry, but don't want to do the buffet battle."
1722,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Highly disappointed. Was coming with super high expectations, and maybe that was my downfall. First off, we waited 55 minutes for a table. Once getting seated our waiter informed us that it would be another 45 minutes for our food once we ordered. I wanted to leave right then and there but we waited out of sheer desperation. They should at least give you some bread or something to munch on if you're waiting that long. I got the first farm Indiana special, which was sage fried chicken, bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit.
The chicken was extremely dry, and the only hint of sage flavor was the dry rosemary they threw on top.
The BACON mashed potatoes was just mashed potatoes with two slices of bacon on top. Not horrible, but deceiving from the menu description.
I got my eggs over medium. They were good, but how hard is it to mess up eggs?
The biscuit was good, but very dry and sucks up any ounce of moisture in your mouth without any butter or jam or syrup. 
The display was elaborate and pretty, ill give them that. And the portions were MASSIVE. But overall I'd save the money for this expensive meal and go to Denny's instead."
1723,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Visited this location on The Strip which is located in The Quad (formally the Imperial Palace) for the very first time.  The big drawback to this location is there is presently a ton of construction going on in front of the hotel and it makes it very difficult to enter the hotel and even find the self parking.  If you plan on visiting this location, allow yourself the extra time to get to where you need to go.  Now, onto the review:

We arrived at the restaurant at approx. 10 am on Tuesday, November 12, 2013 .  Big thing for them is they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived.  This makes complete sense since the space is limited and they don't want one single diner to hold up a potential table for others while they wait for the rest of their party.  I appreciate this rule and the hostess are very polite when they share this rule.

We (me and my 3 friends) were taken to a corner booth and given our menus.  Within a minute or two someone approached us and asked us for our beverage order.  I believe she must have been the server assistant (bus person).  A few min later we received our beverages.  The waiter (sorry, forgot his name) approached our table to see if we had questions and find out if anyone of us were new to Hash House.  We mentioned to him that 2 of us were new to Hash House, and he promptly explained the menu and portion sizes of the food.  We took a few min to order because of our conversation at the table with one another, but ordered within 10 min of being sat.  

I ended up ordering the Lumberjack breakfast which came with 2 eggs and your choice of meat or potatoes and 1 large pancake.  You have the option of upgrading or substituting for a speciality pancake for an additional charge.  Because of the holidays, I choose the pumpkin pancake. On a side note, my friends ordered a ""LARGE"" cheeseburger with fries, a second Lumberjack breakfast, and an omelette.  However, just before our food was delivered, the waiter told me that the chef made the mistake of making a pecan pumpkin pancake on my order instead.  He offered to make me a new one or asked if I was ok with that.  I like them both, so I said the pecan pancake was just fine.  The breakfast was delicious, however, adding the pecans to the pancake fills you up fast.  There were a lot of pecans in it.  Granted, this is not a complaint...it's just a lot of food, so come hungry!!  In addition, the coffee was hot and fresh as it should be, and I especially love the pour spout sugar on the table (instead of sugar packets) because, personally, I like a little coffee with my sugar...if you know what I mean!  

Overall, service was great, server was very prompt with our requested items, coffee and water was always kept full, and plates were cleared in a timely manner.  I will definitely be back to this location or another location based on the food quality alone and their delicious coffee!  Also,If you ever have a craving for the perfect drunk food at 3 am after you leave the club, then this is the place to go!

Only negatives I noticed about the restaurant was the noise level in the room is high and it makes it a little difficult to have a conversation with people at your own table.  The other was the lack of cell signal in the hotel.  I like to post pictures on Instagram and Facebook, but had to do it after I left the hotel.  At one point I even had to leave the table and walk out to Valet just to take an important phone call.  But, that is not the fault of the restaurant...just a really old building!  What can ya do?!"
1724,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food was soOoo good and Drew the server was great! They were packed, possibly because it was Superbowl Sunday, but the wait was well worth it! We waited 45 minutes, just enough time to go to the ATM a few blocks down (because the hotel ATM has a $9.99 fee) and play the slots for a moment. I ordered a strawberry lemonade.. .. MmmMm and an egg, avocado, green onion, bacon and cheese scramble, with seasoned potatoes and a biscuit. Their portions are huge and they aren't expensive. It's open 24/7 and located in the LINQ"
1725,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge portion of ""crisp"" potatoes with two eggs, ""house smoked salmon"" with cream cheese and an extra big ass biscuit. Would have preferred  hash browns to the overcooked chunks of potato. The food was served very fast but not as hot as it should've been. Overall tasty brunch with huge portions."
1726,Hash House A Go Go,2,"If a restaurant decides to use the word ""Hash"" in it's name, the hash should be wonderful....sadly, my dish of hash was not....very disappointing.
I ordered the salmon hash and what I received did not resemble a plate of hash in the least. The ingredients were not finely chopped as hash ingredients should be, but rather, were cut in VERY large pieces resembling a stew rather than a hash and lacked the crispy texture well-made hashes typically have. In addition, my poached egg was terribly over-cooked, even though I had requested an egg with a runny yolk.
Based on my meal, I believe this diner's claim to fame is due to it's ridiculously gargantuan portions rather than on well-prepared, flavorful dishes."
1727,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Waited around 30 mins to be seated - I was quite surprised when I saw the line.

Farm Benedict ($18.99 USD)
Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. Loved the sauce - had a nice kick. The sauce made the fried chicken lose a bit of its crisp and not to mention all the crispy batter pieces fell apart as I was cutting it. With all the food layers there is just too much going on for me.

Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles ($19.99 USD)
Fried chicken breasts with smoke bacon waffle tower, served with maple syrup and fried leeks. The fried chicken was a little dry - probably because it was chicken breast meat. The waffles were good though - liked how it had bacon inside. This signature dish was just ok imo, really relied on the maple syrup for flavor and to avoid the dryness.

Food portions were massive - I swear one dish was good enough for 2 people. Food taste was just okay, not quite worth the wait for me though.
Service wasn't the greatest. We waited quite a long time for our meals, and after our meals were served our waitress pretty much disappeared on us. None of the other waiters/waitresses wanted to help out - they all avoided eye contact or ignored my hand waving at them. It wasn't until I finally got a waitress' attention, she told me I had to find my assigned waitress but I said she disappeared, then she said she'll look around for me..... It took around 20 mins for me to get our bill and pay."
1728,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I would to say that I was very disappointed with my recent visit to your location at the Linq. The food was cold in a few spots. And we were there at 630am, how do we not get hot food? Very disappointing.  We go to pay the bill, and the server requested my ID to use my credit card and she says that it's company policy to do so. But I saw other customers who paid with a credit card they didn't get asked for ID, in fact, I was just in Las Vegas 3 weeks ago and went to your location at Fremont Street and I paid with a credit card and wasn't asked for ID. So what's the policy? I really hope that Louisa (our server) didn't profile us."
1729,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We had a 20min wait for brunch but definitely worth it! Bring your appetite- huge portions - wish we had a fridge
for leftovers. Yummy!!!! Beautiful presentation. I enjoyed the sage chicken Benedict and my boyfriend has the corn beef hash."
1730,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go was the bomb!!!  It was very delicious! The service was great and efficient. I would definitely recommend trying this place when in town. My husband had the man vs. food which I can't remember the name and I had the Crab Cake Benedict. It was delicious and the portions were beyond HUGE! We had so much left overs to take with us, and surprisingly after reheating it, it was still delicious! 
We will definitely be a regular when returning to Las Vegas !"
1731,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came straight here after a 5:30am flight to kill time before checking into our hotel. It was pretty empty on a Wednesday morning which made sense but still had a good amount of people. Our waiter was Scotty and was super friendly and nice. He was really patient with us as we asked continually for more things; napkins, to-go boxes, lids, etc.

I got the fried chicken and waffles and my guy got the chorizo hash on the server's suggestion. These portions are seriously ridiculously HUGE. My chicken was decent and the waffle was fluffy and had bacon which I was down for. I definitely should've gotten it without the scallions as I am not a fan it and it was pretty over powering. Overall I thought it was okay, I don't know that I would get it again though. The chorizo hash was pretty good though as we both like chorizo.

Overall my experience here was decent. I don't know that I would consider this a Vegas go-to though."
1732,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This place sucks.  Don't believe the hype, avoid this restaurant like the plague.  First off, this restaurant smells like Donkey poo.  That should be enough to ward ppl off but my friend insisted that I try the Chicken Benedict so we stuck with the plan that's what I ordered.  The platter is HUGE but it's all a sham!  The fried chicken patty is covered and smothered with cheese and gravy on top of 2 humongous biscuits, w/ a smidget of scrambled eggs, on top of a bed of mashed potatoes.  Scrambled Eggs?  WTH-- I ordered a frickin eggs benedict.  Not only that, but these were cafeteria eggs.  UGH.  I just got more and more sick from eating this thing.  Besides the fried chicken patty, everything else was just tasteless, dry, uneventful filler.  i hated this dish.  I left more than 3 quarters on my plate and I showed my waiter how I felt about the meal afterwards (photo attached)"
1733,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Everyone's meal was amazing and the service was awesome! Our group had corned beef hash, the quesadilla, and the pork tenderloin. So good!!"
1734,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I have to rant about this. I went to Vegas for the weekend, and my family had me and my younger sister go ahead of them to grab a table at Hash House A Go Go for 7 people. I have been there numerous times and never experienced this issue before. The service is wonderful here, the food is delicious. They are big plates. It all started when the host asked me 
""how many people""? I said ""7"". He said it will be a moment to set up the table. He passed me off to another woman to sit us down and as I was waiting she began to sit other people down. She ignored me and sat everyone else down. I then began to say ""excuse me, why aren't we being seated?"" She then responds to me ""I need at least half of the party here before I could seat you down, but I could give you a table for two"". I then got frustrated and called my mom to get down to the restaurant. In all my life I have never experienced an issue of having to have half the party there. Right off the bat it wasn't needing half the party there, the lady wasn't taking me seriously due to my young face and small size. I am 20. I then had my mom come and as my mom was speaking to her about why we can't have a table for 7 and why do we need half the party she said she will go get the manager, she however never got the manager she instead sat us down about 10 minutes later and never came back to our section that we were seated at. It is complete and utter bullshit that I cannot be taken seriously. In all my life at going to a restaurant and requesting a table for a large party before has never been an issue for me. I felt hurt and upset for being treated as if I was a child. This restaurant again is extremely delicious, and the service is wonderful. I give it five stars but sadly a horrible hostess who had to be rude and disgusting and ruin some of the experience. I recommend training the host/hostess on proper customer etiquette."
1735,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome french toast, I love you hash house!"
1736,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We stumbled upon this place, probably like many others, looking for food to soak up the booze before the hangover set in. This was the perfect place. We were lucky enough to only have about a 15 minute wait (when we left it was over an hour). The food is great. Creative, comfort food. The servings are HUGE, so I would recommend sharing. The meatloaf was amazing. Of course, as all things in Vegas, not a cheap meal."
1737,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I
think anyone that has watched Man vs. Food should try this place out. I would recommend going for linch, unless you want a wait for breakfast. The portion sizes are obscene, sit by the kitchen if you want the entertainment value if seeing the ridiculous size dishes served, that was quite fun. I ordered the chorizo hash, which wax also more than i should eat. 

The service was quite good, no real complaints.

I don't give five stats unless it's basically a religious experience, however they did lose a star because we ordered the ""tractor"" for my daughter's meal to be served in, and they hrought it out on a plate. I don't consider this an issue with our server as i saw her walk by as someone else served the food and asking the kitchen where her tractor was, which was brought out a few minutes later. 

I will definitely visit this place once each time i come to Vegas, just make sure you plan to walk it off afterwards."
1738,Hash House A Go Go,5,The freakin bomb! OMG delicious! The portions are huge so you can definitely share and the prices are really reasonable. We ate there for lunch and dinner it was so good!
1739,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place seems to be the hot spot for many. It was a full house! I checked out this place on a Tuesday morning at the linq hotel. The wait wasn't that bad, waited for about 15 mins. Took the waiter about 5 mins before she got to our table for drink orders. Another 10 before she finally delivered our Diet Coke. 

Sage chicken and waffles - 3/5 - portions size were huge!!! Flavor wise is lacking and Too much breading. The waffle were stuffed with bacon which were delicious. 
 
Kiwi watermelon lemonade - 4/5 - something different to try if you like lemonade, definitely very tart but good overall. Not too sweet. 

Service is really slow here, we had to hunt down our server. Not sure if this place stays busy like this all day or not but fair warning. Lol"
1740,Hash House A Go Go,3,The line to eat here was very long so we ordered take out. The food was okay and the portions were HUGE. Their wall of fame was interesting to look at while waiting for our food.
1741,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I saw the Man vs. Food episode and made my friends go with me.  I don't think I could've finished the Chicken Benedict by myself.  Between the three of us, we had the Chicken Benedict, mango flapjacks, and and omelet.  

The Chicken Benedict comes with cheese and bacon and is placed on top of a mountain of mashed potatoes.  It's so big that it comes with a steak knife.  

The flapjacks have quarter-sized pieces of mango in them.  I regret saving this for last because we all know how pancakes are the next day.  They were delicious, but we couldn't finish them.

The omelet was one of the best I've ever had.  Perfect mix of eggs, cheese and avocado. 

All three of these came out to about $40.  Inexpensive by any standards, especially Vegas.  We should've came here two days during our trip.  We would've saved a lot of money in food."
1742,Hash House A Go Go,5,My fave spot in Vegas. A must go to spot if you hungry the portions are CRAZY BIG! Chicken and waffles... BOMB. MMM!
1743,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best Breakfast in Vegas! Hands down the most delicious breakfast you can get in all of Vegas. I've gone here on three different trips to Vegas and have enjoyed their delicious food each time. The portion size of their food is enormous. Most items you order you could split with another person. My girlfriend and I always tend to split something there and we both leave stuffed. 

Their coffee/espresso drinks are creative and delicious. My girlfriend loves their banana latte and I personally love and always get their Cinnamon Roll Latte, because it's made with real cinnamon and isn't too sweet. When it comes to food, the French toast is phenomenal! They use fresh bread that is perfectly soft and the banana French toast is even better with two warm half sliced banana slices placed on top of the French toast combined with drizzling syrup over the entree leads to a delicious masterpiece. The Hash House A Go Go is a staple of Vegas and a must go to if you're staying in Vegas! You will not regret coming here. The service here is also very on point! Our server was great with refills and attending to our needs."
1744,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Thank you Yelp for this awesome find! This place reminded me of Texas, everything was bigger and better!

I had to try the pancakes/flapjacks after reading Andrew L.'s review and I was not disappointed at all. The pumpkin pancakes were delicious... basically tasted like a pumpkin pie! 

The boyfriend got this huge plate that would've probably fed 4 people. 

I referred this place to other friends that were in town and from what it sounds, they liked it just as much as I did. =)"
1745,Hash House A Go Go,5,Always our favorite place for breakfast when we are in Las Vegas. If you love home cooking this is your place. The menu has a variety of items that are specials...try them! The service is great as is the food!
1746,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is amazing! The portions are huge and you definitely get your money's worth out of this place. Especially that chicken benny. That thing was huge but I managed to finish the whole thing, minus a few bites but you'll get how much it is when you order it. 

The chicken benny which was recommended was the best thing I've had in Vegas so far. Boneless fried chicken that's crispy and not dry! On top of biscuits, eggs and other delicious goodness that I just devoured. The meal was a good brunch because you probably won't eat for the rest of the day. This place will keep you full but in a good way. 

We also got the fried chicken salad which was huge! The chicken was also moist and the outside was crispy. 

You definitely can't go wrong eating here and you definitely won't want to miss out on this place. Grab a menu before you get seated so you can drool over all your choices.

Get some of their mixed drinks as well. You might be waiting a long time for your food and you might deserve it after waiting for your table."
1747,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Andy Sage's fried chicken Benedict is to die for! Pricey, but portions are huge and totally worth the wait and the service was extraordinary!  A must go while in Vegas! Nothing else to say but, PLEASE CONSIDER OPENING ONE IN SOCAL! :)"
1748,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Don't know what happened but this was the worst experience I've had in a long time. We were basically abandoned once we were seated. The food was wrong when it finally arrived. Didn't make a big deal over it until it hit the mouth and was stone cold. 

Have been to several locations and realize we all have an off night but this was beyond unacceptable. We were pretty much treated like it was our problem. We witnessed several people ahead of us leave in disgust and thought they were probably just those high maintenance types. Turns out we did the same thing."
1749,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fun atmosphere, amazing food, MASSIVE portions. My husband and I shared our breakfast plates. We loved this place so much, we went twice while in Vegas for 5 days!"
1750,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It is a definite place to go to when you are at Vegas. It has been featured on Man vs. Food and you have to try the Benedict entree. It is big so if you want to share then that is okay. For me, I am a hungry guy and it always make me full and is delicious in taste. Do come here and try their food!  It can be a little pricy but definitely worth it!"
1751,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I went here at about 4am after drinking wayyyy too much and walking the strip wayyy too long in heels. LOVED IT!!! The portions are huge! It was recommended to me by a guy that I met on the strip. Great suggestion. I honestly only gave in and went because Adam Richman went and I loved watching Man vs Food. Sidenote: I didnt go WITH the guy that I met on the strip. My niece and I loved the food. I got the chicken and waffles and she got a pumpkin pancake. I was upset the waffles had bacon in them as I dont eat pork but the chicken was TASTY!!! It looked like a work of art. The pancake she had was bigger than her head! The waitress was nice. She looked like she needed to retire but she was efficient and pleasant. It was very cold in the restaurant. The place was full for 4am though. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. The hostess didnt seem like she really wanted to be there either. Oh well, I went for the food. Great food! You should go!!!"
1752,Hash House A Go Go,3,Stop with the Christmas tree in the chicken and waffles please. Kept it simple.
1753,Hash House A Go Go,5,"BBBBBBBBBLT. 

Love this place. Loved it in San Diego. Love it more in Vegas!

We arrived late from our flight. Checked into hotel and walked right over. 

Soooo worth it. 

We had the BBBLT. My gosh this was great. 

Fresh bread. HUGE bread lol 

Fresh veggies. 

Awesome bacon! And so much of it. 

Side of fries were so tasty too. 

Tip: if you get here and don't have breakfast, this is a must try!!"
1754,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This is my 3rd time coming and I have never had such a horrible experience. The waiter took our order as if rushing me and the place was not busy I arrived here at 2:25 Am on a Tuesday morning. He then took my order and I waited a total of 50 minutes before I decided to leave because all the other patrons in the restaurant that arrived After I did got served. If you are a waiter then you should be looking after your patrons, he clearly passes by my table several times how can you not notice that everyone has food except my table!  terrible service I will not be coming back."
1755,Hash House A Go Go,5,ok lets get straight to the point.....go here before you die!!!! off da chain!!!! food....appearance....quality....service...well deserved! stop guessing....and go...period!
1756,Hash House A Go Go,5,Breakfast was amamzing... chicken and waffles was savory..so glad I found this place. It's a must for breakfast.
1757,Hash House A Go Go,5,Portions are HUGE! Boyfriend had the sage chicken Benedict- loved it but ate himself into a food coma haha. I had the eggs with French toast which was nice with the watermelon cocktail.
1758,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Been here 2x ... It's still the same place now called the quad and no longer imperial palace... Through the construction up the escalators and to the left. 

The first I went we had pretty much breakfast second time lunch but both times had the chicken and waffles... I have to say that I went with two different groups (breakfast there was 4 of us and 2nd there was only 3 of us) And both times we couldn't finish anything! The portions are so huge u can probably feed that family with 19 kids and counting lol. Ok maybe not that much. But I guess you can order 3 chicken and waffles and feed them all lmao. 

I'm not a big chicken and waffles fan. I'm more of I like chicken and I like waffles but not together. The chicken was fried but a bit dry. The waffles however was fluffy and infused with bacon! Yums! 

Other than that their menu is pretty generic.. Hamburgers, salad and meatloaf! Though all good portions nothing to brag about."
1759,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I ordered a variety of things, bc I wanted to try so much.
(Remember that the portions here are huge.)

Banana Latte: DON""T BOTHER ordering this. This did not taste anything like bananas!
I was so disappointed. I could have saved myself $9.

The HH original benedict: Thumbs up. Its very tasty.

Bacon Waffle: THUMBS DOWN. Its basically 4 pieces of square shaped waffles with two bacon strips baked into it.....I thought this waffle was going to have bits of bacon all over the entire things, cooked into it.:(

Meatloaf: DELICIOUS.

The one thing I loved about this place is the way they plate everything. The portions are huge ,but the way they plate it is very clean and colorful, not messy at all. Great Job.
I will definitely be back to try more things."
1760,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We stayed at The Linq and this restaurant was very convenient. We had both brunch and dinner at the Hash House, both meals were delicious. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this restaurant during your stay in Vegas!"
1761,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Let me start with we arrived at 10:15a on a Monday morning... and there was a long line with a 45 min wait. Not a problem, we had expected this. We looked at a menu while we waited and ordered just after they sat us. 

The portions are ENORMOUS. There is just no way one person could finish their dish... no matter what you order. In fact, most people could split any dish and each walk away full. We had the pancake + eggs combo... which you can get plain or flavored... and they were absolutely amazing. We got out of there for around $23 a piece and we had enough food that we each had leftovers. 

We will definitely be back... and definitely want to check out happy hour!"
1762,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for bfast with my girlfriend one Sunday morning. Seated us quickly, waiter was delightful and very helpful. Portion were BIG and food was delicious!"
1763,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It's definitely a cool spot, located in the LINQ hotel. Service is eh, food mediocre. But if you want a cool vibe and some styling dishes, come through folks. The food is crazy portions but that's the good part. My husband got the corn beef hash plate it was bomb dot com. But my "" popular "" sage Benedict was garbage lol, literally spicy as hell. My mouth is still on fire and it's been an hour after we've eaten. Long story short we spent about $50 for breakfast, do yourself a favor and just go to one of the delicious buffet located in Cesar's / Aria / Wynn etc"
1764,Hash House A Go Go,3,"another one opens up....another crowded spot. this is my 3rd Hash House and definitely my least favorite one. we were enough not to have to sit through a long wait to get seated on new years morning when we arrived. the place was crowded but i guess we just got lucky. although, by the time we left the restaurant, the waiting area was completely packed.

anyway, we sat at a booth towards the back of the restaurant. our server was nice and friendly, she checked on us frequently even though it was obvious that she was running around servicing multiple large groups. i ordered the andy's sage fried chicken salad while others in my party had the popular dishes, chicken and waffles, pancakes, fried chicken eggs benedict.  my salad, just like all of their dishes, was ginormous! a house bowl of salad with caramlized pecans, apple slices, two pieces of the fried chicken and the big ol' biscuit. i asked for the mango dressing on the side. i have had the sage fried chicken at other locations and this time, my chicken was completely BLAND. what happened???? i was soooo disappointed :( 

i still think they have really good food here with over the top portions at good prices but honestly this experience has killed it for me. i was afraid this was going to happen, they grow too fast, open too many locations and suddenly the quality of food goes down. i really hope they make the proper adjustments soon."
1765,Hash House A Go Go,5,We had the chicken pot pie awesome my husband and I just couldn't finish it great place go outstanding service
1766,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy cow! You get the largest portions here. The portions here are very indicative of the Vegas culture--bigger, better, and more decadent than anything else around. The food is a little on the greasier side. Although there are healthier options, why bother when you're in Vegas? 

The eggs benedict is basically the size of your face. The chicken and waffles will be a literal tower of food. And the hashes will sit in a greasy pan of potatoes. The menu is typical diner food, but just 10x the normal size. Go here if you have a hearty appetite."
1767,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First time visiting Vegas and our friend brought us here. Its pretty pricey bt it was nice to try once. I got the tiger prawns, 3 pieces for 11 bucks. It was very good bt I was disappointed with the amount. Again, its pricey. The chicken and waffles were amazing. Huge portion for 20 bucks. I think it was half a chicken. The waffles had bacon inside it. The chicken was like fried rotisserie chicken. Tasted very good. Their biscuits with honey was to die for! The service was very slow. I had to get their attention more than 3 times. And we had a different server every time so that was difficult. I gave 3 stars only because we had horrible service and the price was too much for me. Bt you do get a lot of food. I was just not very happy with mine. It was a nice experience though."
1768,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food portions were huge! Keep that in mind when ordering. Some of the orders we saw coming out were really plentiful. Really enjoyable experience! 

Quality was decent but not great. The restaurant was very understaffed that day and our waiter took a long time to take our order and bring food."
1769,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here early on a Saturday and was seated quickly! Its important to come early cause the line can get verrrry long! I would recommend calling ahead to see how long the wait is. We ordered the famous chicken and waffles, HH pancakes, the guacamole omelette and the cornbeef skillet. Each dish came with home fries and choice of bread. All the dishes were very good... but I probably would not order the omelette again. The cornbeef skillet was great! Definitely give it a try. You would think cornbeef for breakfast is too much but the dish itself was delicious! Warning though get gravy with your biscuit when your waiter asks you, I got jam thinking the biscuit would be fluffy but the biscuit was hard. It was biscuit fit for gravy! The chicken and waffle was delish as well! The waffle comes with bacon in the middle making the waffle moist and seasoned by the bacon grease. The chicken was cooked juicy with a crispy outer layer and tasted like there was minimal seasoning just the simple salt and pepper! Last but not least the HH pancakes were humongous! The plate came with fries and a bowl of fruit that were not really needed though because you'll get full just off the pancake! The pancake was great, fluffy, thick and moist! Add some butter, pour on some syrup and perfection! I would definitely order this again! Somehow we were able to eat all our food so no leftovers really but if you come and are not starving plan on taking some pancake home! Don't drench your pancake in syrup from the beginning... you dont want a mushy pancake for leftovers!"
1770,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Overall, I enjoyed my meal here. My friend and I shared the sage fried chicken eggs benedict and the vegetable hash. First, as you probably know from other reviews, the portions are GINORMOUS! We definitely could have shared one entree and been fine. 

We waited about 45 minutes for a table, but it was nice because we could wander around the Linq and come back closer to the time. The wait time they quoted was pretty accurate. 

I will say that, overall, the hash was a miss for me. I found that rather ironic because the name of the restaurant has hash in its name. The hash itself was bland and underwhelming. It tasted like there was no seasoning on it. I was not a fan. The one redeeming quality of this dish was that the over medium eggs on too were cooked to perfection!

On the other hand, the sage fried chicken eggs benedict was delicious!!! The only miss was that the eggs were overcooked; they were cooked through and not runny at all. However, the chicken itself was perfectly fried and well seasoned. It was just the right amount of crispy; mouthwateringly delicious! I also loved the biscuits! They tasted homemade, a bit crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Everything together with the sauce was heavenly. I couldn't stop eating it! I excited to come back and try the popular chicken and waffles next time!"
1771,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service was good, food came out in a decent amount of time. We had a variety at the table. I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over easy, very tasty. Portions were large. Weird that they offer a chorizo hash but don't have salsa. How do you serve a Mexican dish without salsa. The strawberry jam/compote was yummy, not overly sweet to compliment the enormous biscuit. Everything was cooked as requested. I was expecting something amazing & got a good meal. I wouldn't wait more than 15 minutes, the place was packed and the wait was long when we left."
1772,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Out of control.  This place is equal parts style, quality and quantity.  The menu is bold, creative and absolutely delicious, offering stylized versions of classic dishes as well as new ideas.  The portion sizes are ridiculous -  if you are not starving or on a diet, you might consider sharing.  I got a blueberry, pecan pancake that was probably 14-15 inches in diameter.  I tried my my best to finish the rich an tasty - with it's huge mutant blueberries and candied pecans - flapjack, but alas, it could not be done.  The prices are also very reasonable for food of this quality and quantity. If anyone from HH is reading this, you should build locations in Orange County and Los Angeles.  You'd be one of the most popular joints in town!  Perfect score."
1773,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Get there early cause it can get very busy. Our wait time wasn't too bad at around 10:00. We were not aware of the huge portion sizes, so we were taken back when we saw basketball sized pancakes and hand sized fried chicken. Bring a huge appetite because the food is very filling. Overall, the food was average. Decent price for Vegas standard. The service was mediocre at best. We had to constantly ask for coffee and water. I felt somewhat rushed due to the large crowds."
1774,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After you're seated (1 hour wait on a Saturday afternoon), there's an additional 30-40 minutes until your food is served from the time you order. There are no appetizers on the menu. Biscuits are $2 each. Overpriced and over hyped if you ask me. It's definitely a tourist spot."
1775,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very good food! Super crowed so we got takeout but the restaurant employees were really nice! I got the hash meatloaf, which was a little more greasy than I'd have liked but still really good!"
1776,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I really wanted to make sure we ate well in Vegas and boyyy did HASh House and Go Go help accomplish that on the breakfast end!! I found this place on google and after so many good yelp reviews I placed it on the ""TO EAT LIST"". The hubby and I woke up early Friday morning and did our morning stroll of the strip (walking from Mandalay all the way to this location to work up our appetite). This location is located in the back of the Harrah's hotel which can be confusing because it notes on here that it is near the Linq. The wait here on a Friday morning at 9am was long! I guess I wasn't the only one that had done my research. I placed our name on the list and was told it would be a 25 to 30 minute wait. The hostess informed each guess that you could purchase a bloody Mary while you waited. Also, the restaurant doesn't have a bathroom for its patrons, so if you need to go I would suggest going before you eat-- you have to go down the stairs around the corner and through the woods (jk on the woods part) to get to the restroom. Finally after waiting we were called and placed at a very nice looking booth. The breakfast menu looked so good the hubby and I didn't know where to start. The menu prices are also very reasonable-- so there is something on here for everyone. My husband ended up ordering the Basic meal and the house strawberry shortcake, while I opted to try the famous chicken and waffles, a side of bacon, and a side of eggs. Also what's being in Vegas without ordering a drink for breakfast!?? I ordered the spiked Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade, which was AMAZING!!! If I could I would start a lot my mornings with this drink! It took a little while for our food to come out (25 minutes or so) but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since they had a packed house. My husband enjoyed every bit of his meal. My plate of chicken and waffles was MASSIVE. There was no way I was going to be able to finish it on my own. I enjoyed my waffles and chicken but I felt the fried chicken could have been seasoned a little better. My husband really enjoyed his strawberry shortcake as well. Our service was really good and when I am back in the Vegas area, I will be back to this restaurant!"
1777,Hash House A Go Go,5,Chicken pot pie is phenomenal. Our waitress was great . Love this place can't wait to come back . We are glad we discovered this spot .
1778,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Fantastic food and drinks. A little pricy, but the portions are huge so you get your monies worth for sure."
1779,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait for a table can be pretty long on the weekends, but the food is worth it. The food takes longer than you think it should, so be prepared to wait through a couple of Bloody Marys. The portions are completely ridiculous, so you will either leave full to stuffed or guilty that you left so much on your plate. This is comfort food, so healthy isn't at the top of the priority list. They will do an egg white substitute if you're feeling guilty about the bacon that is cooked into your waffle. Good stuff."
1780,Hash House A Go Go,4,The portions are huge! We ordered the chicken and waffles. This is seriously plenty for 2 people. Love the bacon cooked inside the waffles and the chicken is good. Also tried their BLT Bloody Mary.it actually comes with toast on the side and you have fixins to make a BLT to eat with your drink! The BKT makes for great hangover food! Definitely will go here again!
1781,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came here at 11am on a Thursday and had a 20 minute wait. We went to the bar for a drink and I got a Huckleberry Sin. This drink was amazing with fresh blueberries, but didn't seem to have much alcohol in it. I was surprised when we cashed out that the bill my boyfriend signed showed $13.99 for the drink I ordered because I could have sworn the menu showed $9.99. The check did say it was indeed my type of drink, so I assumed I read the menu wrong. We went to sit down and, while looking at the menu, I saw that it was $9.99 on the menu, but assumed that maybe because I had the souvenir glass, it was a different, unadvertised price. We actually stopped back in here for a drink another day we were in town and I ordered the same drink and was only charged $9.99...so I don't know what happened the first time. It wasn't a huge price difference or anything to complain about, but I just wanted to note it for others in case this happens often, you might want to check your bills carefully.

For our meals, we got the fried chicken benedict and the crab cake benedict. Both were served over biscuits that sat on top of a huge mound of mashed potatoes. Both of us really enjoyed our meals, but would probably try other menu items next time. Neither of us liked the mashed potatoes at all, but with the enormous portions, I was actually glad to have an excuse to not eat something on my plate because I was so full. I do need to note that, neither of us are fans of biscuits. As in, I never eat them, never like them. The biscuits here were AMAZING. I don't know what they put in those biscuits, but I couldn't stop eating them no matter how full I was."
1782,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Well worth the wait which was 1 hour! The waffle and fried chicken plate was great! So much food, u could really share but everything sounds so good that you will end ordering other meals."
1783,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food here will feed your eyes better than your stomach. When the food gets to the table there's bound to be ooos and ahhs. But as soon as you eat a bite you'll be disappointed. Maybe even confused. How can something that looks so delicious taste so bland??? Yes the portions are big, but big portions come with big prices. The chicken and waffles can easily feed two people, so I definitely recommend sharing. Unfortunately that means only trying one item if you're not in a big party.

The wait at 2pm was estimated at 45 min to an hour, but we got seated after 20 min. If you don't feel like waiting, be sure to check the bar for self seating!"
1784,Hash House A Go Go,4,"food was really good, but portions were HUGE... too big.
also, overpriced, but everything on the Strip is."
1785,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you are tired of buffets (either $$$$ or amount of food) then this is the place to go for a unique spin on a normal breakfast lunch or dinner.  Chicken and Waffles were very good and certainly very filling.  The banana stuffed French toast was also very good in the Tractor Driver Combo.  There will be a line to get in but even if it is 30 mins, it is well worth it.  

Area for improvement is in syncing plates to arrive at the table at the same time.  They boast that they don't use heat lamps and microwaves but there are better ways to time fire a dish so that they all come up near the same."
1786,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Die besten Pancakes, die ich in Vegas gegessen habe.Sehr rieÃige Portionen die aber dem Geschmack keinen Abbruch machen. Echt schmackhaft und sehr zu emfehlen"
1787,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ridiculously large portioned food. Very creative and delicious. If you can share with someone I would definitely recommend. Great food if you a hungover!

Only qualm is the wait but that's just because it's really popular!"
1788,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food here is very delicious. Excellent presentation. The serving sizes are really huge. So the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. Very friendly staff.
1789,Hash House A Go Go,4,"There's chicken and waffles, and then there's a friggin TOWER of chicken and bacon waffles!

A wee bit hard to find as it is on the 2nd floor, I sat at the bar. Peering at my neighbours gargantuan plates of food, I knew I made the right choice.

What quickly arrived after ordering was a daunting steak knife holding together this frankenstein creation. Also stabbing through the chicken was what looked like a rosemary tree. Geebus.

Chicken was flavourful and juicy, waffles could've been crispier but the bacon integration made up for that.

I hate wasting food, but I just couldn't swallow the carb overload. 

The staff were small town diner friendly and prices beyond reasonable.

Waffle me."
1790,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food and large portions.  A single serving can feed two people.  The prices are a bit high but you do get a lot.  The restrooms are not conveniently located.
1791,Hash House A Go Go,4,"DON'T EACH ORDER A PORTION IF YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T EAT A LOT.

Anyway, even on the menu, the owner recommends portion sharing. 

Crab cakes $15
I thought I could finish crab cakes by myself but nope. Ended up dumping half of it on my sister's boyfriend's plate, a third of it on my friend's plate, and to-going the rest. It did get sickening after 15 minutes. 

Chicken Waffles $20
AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. Crispy chicken that's so flavorful and dry, it was perfect by itself. The waffles were alright, they had slices of bacon in between. 

Steak and eggs $20: Requested medium rare but got well-done, no matter. Still delicious.

Hot chocolate $5.99
This could be a meal itself. Hands down the best hot chocolate I've ever had. Made from scratch, its a smooth drink with 4 large marshmallows drowning in the chocolate goodness. We ordered two of this for a table of four and still couldn't finish it.

Came around 9:30AM and there was a 15 minutes wait. Not too bad. Left around 10:47AM and  the crowd was alarmingly huge. 

Notes: 
-Open 24/7
-Come during off hours
-Share! 
-Great for hang-overs"
1792,Hash House A Go Go,4,"i'm still trying to work off my FUPA from eating all that goodness.

Sage chicken- ok but bland... where's the sage?
meatloaf hash- HEAVEN in a skillet pan
salmon hash- pretty yummy if you like salmon 
banana pancakes- food orgasm"
1793,Hash House A Go Go,5,The wait staff and food was great! It was one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had.
1794,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was pretty good.  The pancake was HUGE!!  Enough for 2.  The wait was a bit long but it was worth it.
1795,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always packed. A clear indication that it is just that great!

Must try the chicken and waffle! The waffle has freaking bacon in them! Oh man I'm already salivating while writing this review.

Portions are huge! The manfriend and I shared the chicken and waffle and we were good. Btw we eat a lot! :D

For you folks that live in vegas, you guys are lucky! :)

Can't wait to be back~"
1796,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing! Always a long wait but worth every second. So much food you can share. We love breakfast and lunch. The drinks at the bar are a work of art!
1797,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is a great place to eat on the strip.  You are definitely getting your money's worth with the portions of food.  In fact, if I was in Vegas and low on cash and needed food, I would go here because you could easily get three or four meals out of your own entree.

My friend and I split the sage fried chicken bennedict and we did really well, but still had a ton left over (I saw it on Man. Vs. Food).  There's a $2 fee to split a dish, but our server told us right away about it and then said that if we ordered a side dish, we could wave the split charge.  So, we got the au gratin potatoes and were very happy with the decision.  It was like a tower of goodness-- but maybe too much for some people.  

My husband got the French Toast and I think he got a half a loaf of bread!  It was delicious!  But, the syrup was already on it, so I guess if you want more syrup, you would have to ask.

Every entree we saw at the restaurant was huge.  Their burgers could feed a family of four.  Literally.   Every entree could feed at least two people.  

The service is good, nothing amazing, but nothing horrible so don't worry about that.  The atmosphere is good as well.  We went to the one inside the Imperial Palace-- it's close to the entrance overall, so you won't have to wander around a maze for half and hour trying to find it."
1798,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My hubby and I just left from the Hash House. I had the chicken benedict, and he had the chicken and waffles. It was late afternoon on a Tuesday so seating and service was quick. The food was tasty and both were LARGE portions. Also, it was a very inexpensive. The meal was great!

Only 2 complaints: The server was a bit absent-minded and forgot our drink refills and condiment requests. And the restaurant's location is in the middle of the Imperial Palace, an old 2-star hotel casino that stinks of stale cigarettes."
1799,Hash House A Go Go,1,Yes the food is gigantic but the flavors are not very good.  The wait was too long.  If you decide to go.  Order one dish and share it.  The biscuits with honey are pretty good.  I understand they are busy but service is lacking.  My son who is shy was trying to say his order and the server kept being distracted by talking to other servers who walked by and were joking some quip or another.  It was frustrating for my son who struggles with a diagnosed social anxiety.
1800,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I've got to agree that the portions are huge and should be shared by 3 or more people.  If you have a refrigerator in your room for the left overs then go ahead and get one meal for yourself.

We actually ate there twice because we were staying at the Imperial Palace.  The first night we had the Sage Chicken and Waffles and the #5 burger that was stuffed with bacon and avocado.  The chicken was dry and the hamburger really didn't have much flavor.  I also ordered a beer off of the draft list and was told that they don't carry draft beers at the that location but they all of the restaurants use the same menu.  That seems kinda cheap to me.  I was really looking forward to a Mothership.

The next night my husband and I shared the Sage chicken Benedict.  This time the chicken wasn't dry and the hollandaise sauce was flavorful but the biscuit underneath was dry and hard.  Our girls got the tractor pancake breakfast and the pancake was HUGE!! One lady that was walking by said ""Look its the Uncle Buck pancake!!!!""  The girls got a laugh out of it but when I tasted it I thought ""dry again.""

So what I would recommend is that if its late and you are staying in the hotel it doesn't hurt to try it once but don't make a special trip just to eat there.  I was very disappointed."
1801,Hash House A Go Go,5,My absolute favorite place to eat when I'm in Vegas. Everything I have tired is made to perfection. And the portions are ginormous!!! You can share a dish with a friend or 2. While visiting for a week we went back almost everyday. I had the chicken and waffles it's literally 2 huge chicken breast with four waffles made to perfection with bacon in the middle! Chicken pot pie was heavenly.. Just pure warm goodness in your belly loaded with chunks of veggies and chicken. And the maple bacon pancakes were just off the chart good! If you are looking for a reasonably priced placed to eat in Vegas with amazing food this is the place to go.
1802,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Writing this live as we enjoy -

Service - very friendly but bounces between rushed and painfully slow. Overall not a bad thing maybe it's just vegas.

The giant BLT -Bloody Mary - served with a big slice of tomato, toast, lettuce and mayo - well wife said it best ""This is so decadent!"" But then again it does have fruits and vegetables so how can it be decadent? 

Ok - the food just arrived - I think I might be afraid! Ha! The sage fried chicken and eggs dwarfs the plate - an awesome display of foodie-gasm! Hidden amongst the expansive Uber chicken steak was bacon - crispy but not over cooked.  Oh yes and a medley of hash brown potato.

Nestled in the plate - strawberry jam - taste like grandma's!

Wife had salad - I think there is 10 pounds of it! Displayed with a lovely biscuit and cucumber dressing - absolutely a delicious and healthy offering!  Oh yes - the salad included fried corn bread croutons - I am loving this meal.

If you want a great meal - this is the place to try- but bring your Thanksgiving pants! Food is YUGE here ;).

I strongly recommend it and give it ""five out of five forks""."
1803,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food- super-size portions.  Drinks are fabulous.  The only downside to this place is that the Imperial Palace is so cruddy.  GO, EAT, ENJOY."
1804,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Overall very good experience but I highly recommend to split a meal even if you are hungry.  My pork fried sandwich was literally 12 inches by 9 inches and a good half in think.  The bun it came with was a joke in that it was so small and it was a regular size bun for a good size hamburger.  The only thing was the pork needed something to go with it as it got to be a bit too much deep fried food due to the size, but it was very tasty.
My wife had the stuffed meatloaf and could not figure out how it was stuffed until she found an entire other piece of meatloaf under the other items."
1805,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Okay,  the portions here are HUGE!  Come here ready to eat a lot!   I came here with a $25.00 restaurant.com certificate (that I bought for $2), great deal by the way. 

I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict and the BF ordered the Bacon BBQ burger.  The food was amazing and man I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack after I was done.  There was so much fried chicken topped with gravy, scrambled eggs, and more gravy with biscuits!  The burger was huge and the meat was super thick and juicy.  The bacon hung over the patty!  Yum!

Needless to say, we had plenty of left overs that we took back to our room for later....

Even after all that we found room to order dessert.  OMG, the best peanut butter cheesecake I've ever had.  We even convinced the tables around us to order it, because it was that good!  Oh, and one slice was plenty for two.  Actually any of their meals is good to share.

Can't wait to go back and try their fried chicken and waffles!"
1806,Hash House A Go Go,2,"well...it was okay.

i went with some friends who raved about how great this place was. two of the five of us went to get a table, and after waiting for 25 minutes, were told that we couldn't be seated until our whole group was here (which would have been helpful to know when they took down our names). even though the rest of the group was only 30 seconds away, we got knocked to the back of the queue.

all the while, i'm looking at the menu deciding what i want. i finally decide, and we are finally seated at 11:03, 40 minutes after we first got there. when we were seated, the waitress gave this huge intro speech about how great hash house a go go is and how everything is fresh and made to order and that nothing is pre-prepared. when i went to order the item that i'd been eyeing the whole time we were waiting, i was told that i couldn't have it because they switched over their menus at 11, even though we first got there long before. they also told me that i couldn't substitute anything, because there wasn't enough room in the kitchen to make everything to order.

now waaaaaaait a second. i though you just said that you make everything to order and that nothing is preprepared. i guess there are obviously exceptions to every rule. okay. fine. forget it. so i ordered a burger.

the presentation was spectacular, but fell short on taste and practicality. the patty was twice the size of the bun, and therefore the toppings were all over the place. it was impossible to get one single bite with all of the toppings in it. i had to cut off the excess patty just to figure out a way to raise it to my mouth. it was so greasy i had to wash my hands, face, and forearms after eating it. it was...meh. i didn't take the leftovers.

my negative opinion probably wouldn't be so negative if the place weren't hyped up by not only my friends, but the waitress herself. i probably won't go back on my next vegas visit."
1807,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yesterday was my first time eating here, I'm truly pissed it took me as long as it did!

My friend and I saw how big the plates were, so we decided to split something. We went with the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Thanks to our cool waiter, we also ordered a side of bacon for $3 in order to avoid the plate split charge of $2.50. 

The food was SO good! Their bacon was dee-effing-licious, as was the chicken and waffles! SO much food, even when we split a plate, we still couldn't finish it! The plate comes with two whole fried pieces of chicken breast, along with 4 Belgium waffles. Their waffles even have bacon IN them! SO damn good!!!

It's a LOT of food, I'd say split a plate with someone. Unless you're a linebacker, there's NO WAY you'll be able to finish something on your own. Their pricing isn't bad, considering how much food it is. I know their whole thing here is ""huge plates"", but lowering the price and limiting the amount they give you, would make more sense to me. I just saw too many people waste their food.

The place is simple and cool looking, and our server was very cool. I definitely recommend this place.

1808,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Was so excited to eat here tonight. We had late flight into Vegas and this states 24/7. We check into hotel with no rush and come back downstairs to eat here. This place was closed ""today"" for some reason. Guy walks downstairs and states kitchen closing. Another group was next to us complaining as well. I was so mad! Why does this say it's open???!!!! Ugggh, well we ended up across the way at ""Off the strip"""
1809,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I have to say that I love hash house a go go. I was introduced to it in Las Vegas at imperial palace. Which is now the Linq. Every time I go to Vegas eating at hash house is a must. It originated in San Diego. I have lived there for 18 years and never eaten there. Today I ate at the one in San Diego. It is just as good as the one in Vegas. Much smaller.  But they really know how to do flavors. They can make something as simple as bacon, eggs, and chicken taste like the best thing I ever ate. The last time I went to Vegas it was a 4 night trip. We ate at hash house a go go 3 times. Best trip ever.  I am not a burger and fries person. But they really know how to do it. The beef is flavorful and the fries are very crispy. It is enough for at least 2 meals and is even good reheated. I also love andys sage fried chicken Benedict. I've eaten it many times. Today I had the crab cakes Benny. Never saw that on the menu before. So good.  Just have to give a shout out because I have never been so consistently happy with the food anywhere before. Thank you has house a go go."
1810,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was by far my favorite place on the trip to Vegas. It was conveniently located in our hotel lobby (The Linq) we went for dinner so the line wasn't like it usually is out the door and down the stairs. Our waiter Val was very friendly and quick. They start you off with warm honey butter biscuits that is almost a meal itself, I was shocked to see the proportion sizes! I ordered the ""baby burger,"" with a side salad which was more than enough! My friend ordered breakfast and when her pancake came out her mouth hit the floor! It's literally the biggest pancake I have seen! The food is delicious, their beef was juicy, the atmosphere was fun! The presentation of the food is the best!"
1811,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I thought I had written about this place before - anyway I'm not posting many photos because there are hundreds of them. This place is know for its name and EPIC portions. There is so much food packed on your plate it's enough calories for a few days probably. Hash has a great, jaw dropping - social media necessary quality to their plate. People will be just as surprised to see your photo as you were when you ordered your plate. However this is the third time and I am more than convinced that this restaurant is only worth the first impression and bragging rights to your friends. Nothing special about the food and it's disappointing. For such much hype and the amount of food at least it could be more tasty. Sad that 70% goes to waste. I think you just get overwhelmed and walk out thinking it amazeballs but later realize when you are somewhere else it wasn't all that. All I can say is dont waste your time. Just grab a photo online and say you went. There are so many other great places here."
1812,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow, this place was amazing! Ever had that thought when you go to an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet and you're friend packs mountains of food on his/her plate and the only thing you can think of is ""O.M.F.G. SO. MUCH. FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.""

Kinda like that, but you order it.

One of the places I HAVE to go when I go back to Vegas!!"
1813,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place will most likely be super crowded but definitely worth the wait. The portions here are huge like one plate is at least 2-3 meals. The service is nice and friendly. The food is extremely tasty and has many different flavors involved into it. Theres a lot of garnishes that are cool and yummy.
1814,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was great, enjoyed the pineapple mimosas. Great place to re-energize and get rid of any hangovers!"
1815,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food! Not expensive (for Vegas), and really tasty! We ate there twice in two days."
1816,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I freaking love this place! I'd yelp allowed more specific reviews, I'd give it a 4.5. Huge portions, so plan on sharing. Everything is good. The signature chicken and waffles are worth trying, but I'd recommend the corn beef hash or the chicken pot pie instead. 

Stay away from the over sugary alcoholic drinks and just order what you like from the bar."
1817,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We were excited about eating here when we finally arrived through all the construction there were multiple tables open but we still had a 10 minute wait. The hostess was rude and was sure to finish her conversation with her friend before waiting on us. When we sat down the menu looked good and we ordered pretty quickly. We were told that food would arrive at different times because they didn't have heat lamps and they wanted it out hot. That was fine. But 20 minutes after my husband received his food, I received another menu, I was told our waitress knew they were out of what ordered she thought maybe they would get it. My husbands food was okay. Service was terrible. Do not recommend."
1818,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HASH HOUSE A GO GO is a MUST!! They attract a large crowd on the daily! So be prepared for a little wait.. but so worth it!

They have great food..
Serve big portions..
& Great drinks! 

Tried just about everything on menu.. the chicken & waffles are my favorite!! There's bacon inside the waffles :)"
1819,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This restaurant in in the Linq hotel on the strip! It was 5 am and I was hungry in Vegas. Surprisingly there were no many options at this time in the am so we were happy when we saw this place was open ... It's decent food. The menu is American .... The plates see dirty and I will nut drink the water. 

I had the cheddar stuffed burger with sweet potatoe fries... So good!"
1820,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow this place is AMAZING! Our friend told us to try it out when we came to Vegas. We weren't staying at the Linq but we took the monorail to check it out. After we found it we were hungry and sooo bummed that the wait was over 30 minutes. But we decided to get a bloody mary (delicious) and wait. We found 2 seats at the bar and ended up eating there which was perfect. The waitress/bartender was so nice and on top of things. This place is crazy busy and I can see why because their food is SO GOOD! My husband got the chicken and waffles, which he couldn't finish and I got the hash plate - corned beef. Everything was wonderful and we'll be back on our next trip!"
1821,Hash House A Go Go,5,You must a go go to hash house a go go if given the chance! The environment is fun and country which I found welcoming and entertaining. The food is delicious and you're given huge portions! My husband got the Big O Sage Fried Chicken and Waffle Tower and I got the Tractor Driver Combo with their banana cream French toast and we were so impressed! Definitely coming back next time we're in town.
1822,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent fried green tomatoes, and I usually don't even care for tomatoes, salmon was awesome as well. The gigantic portions made me give it 5 stars."
1823,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions of food.  Good was great   We got here just in time before the line to get in got huge.
1824,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were looking for a good breakfast place on our last day so we checked yelp and decided to try this place. We were seated pretty quickly even though this place was packed. Our server was super friendly and although he did mention how big the portion sizes were, my boyfriend and I wanted different things so we got our own plates. We should have listened to our server..we didn't even get through half our plates before we were stuffed! I got the chorizo hash and my boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy. Both plates were yummy and very filling. I highly suggest sharing with someone or you will find yourself talking half of it to go. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
1825,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for breakfast at the suggestion of a local.  He said that the food was delicious and that the portions were huge.  He was right on both accounts!  My husband and I ordered a Belgian Waffle and I ordered a Blackberry Granola Pancake.  We both barely ate half of it.  Our server, Ishii, started out unpleasant but improved throughout the meal.  The food although awesome, was expensive and we were charged for each cup of coffee.  There were no refills.  We are glad we gave it a try and MIGHT consider returning for dinner.  One thing is for sure, we will DEFINITELY split an entree!

We returned for dinner and we were SO DISAPPOINTED.  The service was AWFUL and the food was a letdown.  We had to contact 8 of our friends to tell them NOT to come for dinner."
1826,Hash House A Go Go,1,This review was for the has house on decateur.  I am only giving 1 star because I cannot choose no stars.  We walked in and the sign said seat yourself so we did and waited for 10minutes without being addressed.  Another table sat down and the waitress went right over to them and helped them and totally ignored us. We walked out I do not recommend this place.
1827,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait to get seated was about 45 minutes for the two of us and the wait for our food after ordering was another 35 minutes. 

However, once we got our food, it was worth it. Very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Big chunks of chicken and plump sweet corn in the scrambler we ordered. We shared the meal and still had food leftover. The portion sizes are beyond rediculous.

SHARE YOUR FOOD."
1828,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here last month for brunch with my friends on a Sunday morning and our wait was an hour long.

We didn't know how big the portions were, so when we got our food we were in shock. One of my friends and I got the Andy Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and two of my other friends got the original Sage Fried Chicken. If we knew how big the portions were, I think we would have just shared. Yea, not sure what I was thinking, I had this place bookmarked (SD location), i should have read the reviews right before going in. Oh well...

I also tried their spike kiwi watermelon lemonade drink, it was so yummy yum-yum! Knowing this place is open 24/7, It is a good place to go after clubbing and drinking all night. 

This place is known to have a long wait, so it's best to come early morning. Also, they get so busy that the service is really slow. It took us a while to get our drinks... overall experience I would come back here and try something different and share with someone."
1829,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Open 24/7. Service was quick and friendly. Food portions were huge and we were encouraged by our server to share. But we wanted two different things. I got the smaller burger which was still huge and a ton of fries, I ate maybe half. He got the chorizo hash which was very spicy and he loved every bite. Def will eat there again. Great prices for the portion sizes."
1830,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Exceeded my expectations. Our party of 2 was seated about 10 minutes after arriving at about 9:30am on a Friday. I ordered the cold brew coffee to start and it was perfectly smooth and delicious. For breakfast we shared a corned beef hash and a blueberry flapjack. The giant flapjack was cooked perfectly and I cannot say enough good things about the hash. Perfectly cooked eggs, and the corned beef was on point, better than I've had at any other ""popular"" brunch spot. 

Overall, huge portions with great quality food. If you're looking to get a good bang for your buck, look no further. Our server Alberto was very friendly and provided awesome service. 

My only critique is for the biscuit, it was ok, but a little too dense and dry for my taste. Maybe would have tasted better drenched in honey :/"
1831,Hash House A Go Go,5,This was great!!!  We had the Sage fried chicken and waffles; and the stuffed burger.
1832,Hash House A Go Go,5,AMAZING!! It's a MUST have if you're in Vegas. Went to Vegas for  bachelor weekend and quickly heard that this was a spot to check out. We were not disappointed and went twice in 4 days!! Wow!!
1833,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Horrible service. Weird smell came from my coffee cup as if it had not been washed with dish soap or really hot water to sterilize. Then it took forever to bring me another. My fork also had that same weird bacterial smell. Once again it took forever to bring me another. My meal was ruined by the unsanitary dishes. Food is plentiful, super huge servings. Enough to share with 3 or 4 people. But the quality is mediocre. I don't recommended it. Try someplace else."
1834,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I would like to say! Damn! 

This place is the epitome of American eating! The portion sizes are ridiculous and the prices are cheap for the amount of food you get. I like to think that I can put a decent size meal away but I couldn't even put a dent in this meal!!! I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit!!

Man, it was big and flavorful. A nice spicy kick to and the chicken was nice and marinated. I couldn't put a dent in it but really really enjoyed it. The cheese sauce was epic too. I would highly highly recommend this place, if you like huge portion sizes!"
1835,Hash House A Go Go,5,I've never seen a crab cake sandwich this huge. Everything looks & tastes fantastic!!!
1836,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We went for breakfast at 9:30 AM and only waited 10 minutes. We were seated promptly but had to wait for some time for water and coffee. The place was busy. We ordered the Tractor breakfast and the spinach hash. Both were enormous. In fact every food item that came out were enormous as was the food waste. Most people around us could not finish their dishes and as the waiter explained to a couple at the next table, they shouldn't worry about finishing their plates because it's nearly impossible. The flavor of the food is just OK--average at best. The best thing on my plate was the biscuit. When we left the restaurant, the line of people waiting was at least 20 deep."
1837,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are huge the food is delicious. My coworker got the chicken waffle and I got the pork sandwich. As you can see from the photos one entree is big enough for 2-4 people, no doubt."
1838,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ate here last weekend inside the Linx Hotel (formerly Imperial Palace Hotel). The portions are insanely large and a single order of any menu item can be shared with your entire table! 
My boyfriend ordered an Eggs Benedict but it was not by any means a normal eggs Benedict!  He ordered :Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. 
Since he ordered that I thought I'd get something a bit lighter and ordered: oatmeal and a side biscuit and gravy..about an hour after we ordered, we got our food. WOW!! The portions are MASSIVE!! The food was very good but neither of us put a dent in our food because of the size of our meals!
I gave this place 4stars instead of 5 because of the long wait to get a table and then the very long wait to get our food after we ordered it. Our breakfast here took about 21/2-3 hours from when we put our name in until when we left."
1839,Hash House A Go Go,4,I was so excited to  check out the hype of this place. And it definitely lived up to it!! Chicken and waffles was absolutely delicious and I got the Andy's sage fried chicken. Portions are huge and you can totally share a plate!
1840,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We had Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs.

My only suggestion is not to layer the cheese on the bacon.  The bacon became soggy and rubbery."
1841,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing breakfast. Portion size was great even with just the basic breakfast. Drinks are typical Vegas prices ($25 for 2 bloody Mary's) but taste great. Saw a manager pitching in to deliver plates to a table with a smile and that's the sign of a great place. Wait was about 20 min for party of 2 at 1000. Bonus is they offer a discount for active military. Worth a visit for breakfast when you're on the strip!
1842,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Definitely expected the chicken and waffles to be tasty.. however, that wasn't the case. I guess because we went around 10pm. Extremely disappointed."
1843,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Wowser, the portion sizes are out of control. I had the chicken and waffles, which came with two chicken breasts and four waffles. I ate half a breast and one waffle. The rest went to the landfill because I don't have a way to deal with leftovers while on holiday. And I didn't eat that much not because it wasn't good because it actually was. The chicken was crisp, juicy and had a fragrant sage seasoning to it. The waffles each had a slice of bacon cooked in and were lightly sweet and semi crisp. It was just all too much! 

My husband had a hash and it came out filling a 10 inch cast iron skillet! Although delicious, again, it was just too much. 

This is a great place since it it's 24/7 and the prices are crazy reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would say that at least two, if not three, people can get one dish to share to reduce the waste and the effect on the wallet."
1844,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food was DELICIOUS. This place was the place my boyfriend and I first went to when we arrived to LV, and it was a meal that was definitely worth the wait. I LOVE breakfast food, and this place just raised the bar.  The food portions are huge, so I took it to go and made a midnight snack out of it :) 

I'd love to come back to this place again. Definitely a must when you visit Vegas :)"
1845,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This was a fun place to go for brunch! It was very crowded, but that was to be expected for a Sunday morning. They are quick though, and we were seated much sooner than predicted. Our server was amazing. He was peppy without being annoying, attentive without being intrusive. He checked in on us just the right amount!

I had the HH Bloody Mary, which tasted great. I so prefer it a bit thicker but that's just personal preference. They even gave me a to-go cup for the leftovers. 4/5

I also had the sage fried chicken tower, which was huge! Accompanied by the bacon waffles, this dish was delicious. I did feel like some of the chicken was a little over fried, but it did not ruin it overall. 4.5/5

I'd definitely come here again!"
1846,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The music is crazy loud and the wait to get in is even more crazier, like 4 hours long! On the bright side the food is really good, but sometimes the service is really lacking , more of a burn and trun atmosphere."
1847,Hash House A Go Go,4,Reallllly goood !!! Table for 7 and bill was only about 130$. Pretty cheap for vegas. Only con was the wait. 2 hours and no reservations. I ordered steak and eggs. Very good. Friends ordered different things like chicken and waffles. Pancake was HUGE ! You can def share plates. We had way to many food left over. I would def go back here !! And the waiter was awesome. Forgot his name but he made our experience alot better ! Thank you.
1848,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We went around 11 on a Thursday and it was super busy. The wait time was around 25 minutes. They use an intercom to announce your name when a table is ready for you, which I think is awesome! 

The portions are huge, it was a little overwhelming. We split the smoked salmon hash, blueberry pancake and the chicken & waffles among 4 people. We weren't even able to finish it all. 
My favorite was the chicken & waffles. The waffle had bacon strips in it. I think the bacon was excessive - it's delicious with just the chicken. 

Our Bloody Mary was amazing! We requested a double with Ketel One for $30. 

I'd definitely come back to try more items on the menu if we stay at the LINQ again."
1849,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Man vs. Food and saw that HHAGG was featured. Well we ventured through the Imperial Casino (smoky) and took the ride up to HHAGG. There was a wait but being the warriors we are we tactfully scouted out a couple leaving the bar area where there were 2 stools (YAY!!!) Anyway, we are seated at the bar area and we meet our waitress Kai. Kai is magnificent. She recommends certain foods on the menu, being that was our first time there. She also makes great tangerine mimosa (How many restaurants you know offers this drink?) Sassy her colleague is just as nice. The food was out of this world. Huge portions, but what the hell you are in Vegas, where you are drinking, so you definitely need something to absorb all that food. I enjoyed every minute of my experience at HHAGG. Andrew thanks also for giving sound advice about the club scene!!!! I'm definitely a huge fan of HHAGG!!!!!!"
1850,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I normally love he hash house. I love the San Diego location. Fantastic.

Here - I don't get the problem. 

We showed up on a Tuesday at 11. Was told the wait 30 min. We waited an hour. 

Ok. We are seated. They take 25 minutes to take our order. Annoying, but fine. 

Then it takes a little over and  hour to get our food. We asked our waitress a few times to check on our food. She would check and say it's coming right up, then nothing. 

Come on really? Food was great - but that isn't acceptable."
1851,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here around 9 o'clock on a Saturday night. Wasn't too busy. The good was delicious! Bought the chicken and waffles. The plates are so big two people can share an entree. The only reason it got 3 stars was the service. We were on a double date and the other couple got their food first and they were almost finished eating by the time our food came out. It literally took an extra 15 minutes before we could eat. Now of course we weren't mad at our friends for eating, but seriously us having to watch our friends eat sucks and is bad form. We did some light complaining to the waiter and he didn't even act like he cared. I would probably try this again though because it was only my first time and you can't always hold it against a restaurant for one instance of employee slack. So hopefully my next visit will be better."
1852,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came here new years day , it was super busy 40 min wait but we got seated pretty fast .

All the servers are in pjs which i found that interesting and cute .

They have so much in the menu but i decided to ordered their fried chicken benedict and husband had their quesadilla, we had a side of their french toast.

Let me tell you my husband had to help me out finishing my plate cuz it was huge but the sauce on top made it super tasty , he took home his cuz it was huge as well, their bacon inside my plate was very juicy and you could tell their chicken they make it themself.

We ordered a side of french toast and we had couple bites and it was good .

Whenever we go back Las vegas we will go back to this place looking forward to try their chicken with the waffles we love eating ;)"
1853,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Let me start by saying I am a vegetarian. This was my first time here, was recommended by my friend. So I though okay why not. 
Came for breakfast at around 8:20 on a Friday. No wait, got seated right away which was awesome. Ordered the hot chocolate and it was awesome! About 6 dollars but I would recommended it and also order it again. My friend got the large apple juice which was also very good. Tastes more authentic than average grocery store apple juice.
 I ordered essentially the vegetarian hash. Lots of veggies, over cubes of hash brown with your choice of stylized eggs. About 15 bucks. To be fair in my opinion, it wasn't worth 15. It was just scrambled eggs, veggies, and a huge biscuit. I ate about 1/4 of my food. It was not gross but nothing to gloat about either. Just average. Way better than a Denny's though.
 For the most part from a vegetarians stand point that's how most of the food looked. Just average, and big portions. 
4 stars because I was obsessed with the hot chocolate!"
1854,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It does not get better than Hash House!  The bloody marys were excellent, as were the fried chicken benedict, chicken and waffles, tenderloin benedict and corned beef hash. Portions are gigantic, and you can easily share.  Every element was fantastic--the sauce, the eggs, the biscuits, the potatoes.....simply excellent.  I went 3 days in a row, if that gives you any idea."
1855,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Did some research on great Vegas breakfasts & Hash House was on top! Had about a 45 min wait (expected, but ordered super yummy Bloody Marys while waiting). As stated, the portions are HUGE! I had the chicken bennedict & hubby had the chicken & biscuits (we should have shared just 1 dish). Service was really fast. The only question I had for the server: ""What do you do with all of those leftovers/scraps?"", as I see half-full plates get taken away over and over. I asked if they compost the waste. Apparently, they just get tossed into the trash. So sad & wasteful."
1856,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came in here BC I was taking in a show at Imperial Palace Sunday evening and thought dinner here would be convenient. 

We had only about 45 minutes so I asked the waiter if he could rush our order. I went with the BBQ ribs but he returned within minutes to advise me they just ran out. WTH run out at 6:30 pm?  I then changed my order to the NY steak medium rare and it came with asparagus, carrots and mashed potatoes with melted cheese on top. The mashed potatoes portion was large and tasty but the steak was cooked properly but was tough and had to much grissel. For around $28.00 I thought it was overpriced. 

The waiter was accommodating and friendly but I've visited the San Diego and Sahara LV location and the food here was the most disappointing of the three. We did get to our show in  time which was a plus."
1857,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The presentation is amazing, but beyond that, nothing to write home about, just yelp.
Service: Took the server 9 minutes to even stop by. We ordered our drinks, and it took another 5 minutes after ordering drinks to find out that they gave us the wrong drink menu, and they still didn't came back with either drink until after the food came out. My husband's drink remained empty until he asked for another one (mid meal), he asks for water and the server continues on to three other tables before even coming back. He left the receipt and pen from the previous guests on the table the entire meal. 
Food:  Texas Ranchero was okay, kind of a disorganized mess with no real distinction between ingredients. The Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles couldn't compare to Roscoe's. The chicken was dry, the batter bland and the waffles played the same tune. Was looking forward to the bacon stuffed waffles, but they were disappointing. The house margarita was watered down, tasted virgin. I'm really sad to say I'm not coming back."
1858,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is awesome. Best breakfast I've ever had, it was enough for two people and I couldn't finish it but you can't and WILL NOT leave this place hungry. Our waiter Andrew D. was on it the whole time, even as busy as they were.. The wait was 45 mins but you must sacrifice for good food, it's a given no matter where you go.

My recommendation : Sage Chicken and Waffles...So on point!!"
1859,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Fantastic food, the sage fried chicken lives up to reputation.  I came here two mornings in a row to get the sage fried chicken benedict.  I had 2 friends, and three of us all came back the next day and got the same things we ordered, because that was how good the food is.

The french toast ordered by my friend was ""best he's ever had"", and that's a direct quote.

The other friend ordered waffles, and you can't describe the smile on his face unless you see it :)

Overall, I tried the place because of my favoriate show MvF.  It turns out the food is as good as it looks on tv.  Only thing is you'd have to walk through the smoky casino to go upstairs."
1860,Hash House A Go Go,5,The portions here are out of control and the food is amazing. The food was very very good I got the sage chicken with scrambled eggs biscuits spinach bacon and mashed potatoes. It was huge and be very flavorful this is a must stop at Vegas.
1861,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just had to take on the Crab Cake Benedict...I was clearly no match ....so help me, as God is my witness...someday I will prevail!!"
1862,Hash House A Go Go,3,I heard about this place because of their branch in San Diego.  I came on a Friday noon at 12 and waited 20 minutes to be seated but it took another 10 minutes for my table to be served very slow service in general but the food came out pretty quick. The portions are huge and worth your money my table of four ordered three dishes and still couldnt finish. Good brunch place and its open 24 hours but unfortunately the food wasnt mindblowing and up to its hype.
1863,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ordered the corned beef with eggs over easy. Eggs were over medium (yolk hard).
It could be my misunderstanding, but the beef was stringy not like a ""hash"".
Coffee was ok, nothing special.

The waiter was attentive and made coffee was filled"
1864,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Farm food with a twist! I like! If this is farm food from Indiana, then I'm going to love Indiana!

I didn't expect this place to be THAT good. We ordered the Corned Beef, which came with two eggs, roasted potatoes, biscuit, and fruits. The other plate we ordered was the Andy's Sage Chicken with maple reductions, two eggs, bacon mash potatoes, biscuit, and fruits. WOW! The portions were ridiculously huge! The service was quick and friendly! 

There needs to be a Hash House A Go Go in L.A. or Long Beach!"
1865,Hash House A Go Go,2,This place looks like some sort of old Diner Style restaurant. The waiter seems nice but not super attentive of us I guess he had bigger tables to do worry about. The Fried Chicken and Waffles was tasty and the portions are huge! I also ordered Sunnyside eggs and some gravy along with that but what I did not like is that they try to charge almost $5 for a little bowl of gravy! That is crazy I mean those gravy cost more than the eggs itself! Maybe if it was $2- $3 I wouldn't mind but for $5 for a small little bowl of gravy is absurd! That is one thing I did not like about this place and something they need to improve on for sure! I do not think I will come back here anytime soon or go out of my way to come here.
1866,Hash House A Go Go,5,The portions are huge. The waiters are nice. I think my only thing is that you shouldn't eat there late night. The crowd is just super drunk people who can't handle their liquor. Let's just say we had to leave early.
1867,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had dinner here with family.  Service was great. Portions were quite large.  Food is definitely not light, but you are obviously going there with this in mind.    It was generally good, but you have to be a bit in the mood for large portions of rather heavy food.  Creative presentation I suppose.  Had the fried chicken and waffles, and then ordered the ""smaller"" meatloaf sandwich."
1868,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'll go ahead and start off my review with this: hash house has gigantic portions at reasonable prices ($12-$15 per entree).

That being said, I think that's where all the ""hype"" is over here at hash house.  My friends and I decided to come here based on all of the great reviews of the place and waited for over an hour on a Friday morning.  I was surprised to see so many people at 10am, but I guess a Friday before a long weekend will do that kinda thing.

Food-wise, I went ahead and took the advice of many of my fellow yelpers, and got the corned beef hash.  Piece of advice for those who don't already know....the hash's are literally gigantic pieces of _____ (whatever meat you may choose) over crispy potatoes/wedges. It is not easily mixable, as the potatoes that are given are also rather large.

The hash was good in itself, but definitely not what I was expecting.  Another one of my friends got the meatloaf hash which did not look too appetizing because they were just pieces of meatloaf chopped up over those crispy potatoes.

The pancakes looked ridiculously large but I did not try them.

Overall, it was an interesting experience to try this place, but I felt that there was maybe a little too much hype surrounding this restaurant.

Quick Tips:

1) Expect to wait (just like any other popular place in LV)
2) Portions are huge so you can easily split one dish among two people."
1869,Hash House A Go Go,5,My husband and I ate here 9/29/13 and boy was it fabulous! I got the tractor combo (eggs.sausage.and French toast!!) Yummy! And my hubby I believe got the man vs food favorite but I'm not 100% sure (biscuits. Chicken fried steak. Chipotle sauce) ...the portions are huge and it was so cheap!! $30 for both ..even IHOP costs more! Highly recommend this place wish we had one in our hometown.
1870,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The crust was excellent especially with the maple syrup. The Bacon Waffle was a bit dry, so wasn't a big fan of it.

I also tasted my buddy's Big O'crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin sandwich, which was not good at all. It's similar to a chicken fried steak w/o the gravy, so it was dry.

Portions are massive, so I recommend sharing one dish with another person."
1871,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Walking through all of that construction.  Areas that should have been blocked off by the casino, we're open and we ended up near very dirty areas that were quite dangerous. No signs with directions to where you're going. 

Now to Hash House A Go Go. I'm not sure if the food is good or not, and I'm bummed with the experience i received here. LOUD music that was a bit much. People were watching football and you couldn't even hear them cheering. The bitch calling out reservations on the loud speaker, was way too damn loud. So if you're hearing impaired or like that noise, try it out. The staff is obviously ill mannered and lack education, and definitely don't understand customer service.  They stood around the host desk, singing and dancing and ignoring customers coming up to make reservations. 

Oh and did I mention that it smells like a club. The cigarette smoke was gross. 

Enjoy!"
1872,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My friend recommended this place, so I expected the food here. Presentation was good but taste was not too special."
1873,Hash House A Go Go,5,We always stop at least once at Hash House during each Vegas run.  Outstanding food and exceptional service.  NOT TO BE MISSED!!!
1874,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge portions, food is good but I was disappointed that the ""eggs Benedict"" wasn't an actually eggs Benedict. They still charge you the same if you don't want meat and you can't substitute avocado. I'll still come back and eat here."
1875,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We had a party of 9 and rolled in about 4:30am. The waiter was okay, we all wanted coffee so he brought out 2 fresh pots for the table. I ordered the most simple thing on the menu: 2 egg breakfast w/biscuit, fruit and potatoes. The rest of the group split their large portion specialties like chicken and waffles, steak and eggs, and a double cheese burger - these portions are worthy of sharing and everyone was having a blast with the portions and presentation. for me: my eggs were ON POINT and the biscuit is up there with the best. My one food complaint: the potatoes on the other hand: dry and flavorless. I was bummed about this and took a star and a half for that. The waiter was just okay - another half star down. THe prices were good considering the large portions. Will def return to this and other HHGG locations - and next time I will  try a gastro meal like my group had."
1876,Hash House A Go Go,5,Brain was our waiter / serve the young man was on point. I have eaten at that San Diego location plenty of times never this one. The wait was a usual 30 min quote we probably waited 15-20. While waiting looked over menus had an idea of what I wanted to eat once seated as usual that goes out the door. Speaking with Brain decided to have the Roasted Chicken garlic Hash or however it's stated. That was one of the most flavorful dishes I have had and the dang on biscuit. I don't care for biscuits at all but it kept staring at me so unassuming it was begging for me to try it. It was moist flaky and light. I just had some more of said biscuits hours later without heating it up and it's still good. Give it a try. Hope your experience is just as good as mine.
1877,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is super fun and electric.. Mimosas were the absolute best.. staff was nice and even tho I had to wait I didn't even realize I was waiting..  everyone visit Vegas should definitely try this place.. I loved the vibes... but it might have been the mimosas.. lol..
1878,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I don't even know what to say...this place was amazing!! So first off...it is a breakfast place...but more of a brunch, however it is open 24hrs. My crew and I came in hungry and ready and we were NOT disappointed. We did have an 1 1/2 wait...so be mindful to bring a snickers bar...because breakfast/brunch is one of the busiest time of the day for them. Also, if you don't specify, they will split your crew up, if your group is larger then 4, so please advise them if you want to sit together (weird I know). 

But now to the food...OMG where do I start...first...if you are a healthy eater...this is the place for you...however if you get full quick...split a meal...there is A LOT OF FOOD!!!  Their tenderloin is the size of turkey serving platter...no joke. Their blueberry pancake...so fluffy and thick, filled with plump blueberries..and also the size of a platter...it could feed 3 adults...or a whole girl scout troop! Their chicken and waffles...devine...We could not get enough of that chicken..the crust was flavorful and crispy and the waffles divine. Their flat iron hash...smack yo' mama good. There is a lot of potatoes under that hash...but that skillet was large enough for two. The hash was so tasty and the eggs were fluffy as was the baseball sized biscuit and all that potatoes hiding under the meat. 

Not only was Hash House good..it was also economical. 7 hungry adults+ five different dishes and 4 mimosa's cost us less then the buffet and left us stuffed...that my friend was a winner!"
1879,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The sage chicken and waffles was on point.  Haven't had anything like that before. The service was just as great as the food.  I had fried green tomatoes for an app, that too was great. It was paired with a watermelon. Sounds weird but it worked perfect.  I'm very impressed by this place. I'll be back again if I visit Las Vegas."
1880,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait was long, but totally worth it! Our waitress was attentive and fast. Prices were decent. Everything on the menu sounds delicious, but resist your cravings because portions are massive--don't be stingy and share! You'll be stuffed--but satisfied--that you'll be ready to head back to your hotel and knock-out with a food coma. :P I'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas."
1881,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love this place. Love the food and the price isn't bad for the portion either. Service is always great here. Everyone are always friendly. However, this time around SHOUT OUT TO PJ THe sweetest and coolest server ever!!! Hopefully we get waited again by PJ the next trip to Vegas. He really made our brunch so much better and more fun! Plus, that red velvet waffles are my fav though!"
1882,Hash House A Go Go,5,The Hash House Go Go is the best. They have the biggest food and the tastiest of all Breakfast foods. I highly recommend getting watermelon lemonade and hash.
1883,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Finally had a chance to try Hash House A Go Go so here I am.  If you order the right entrÃ©e, you will get a HUGE portion, some are not as big.  Awesome presentation and will definitely fill your appetite.

After looking at Yelp pictures I had narrowed my entrÃ©e down to two entrees.  Either the chicken and waffles or fried chicken and biscuits.  My bro order the corned beef hash.  We did not have to wait long and my food was as big as imagined!  Fried chicken, two giant biscuits, four slices of gigantic thick-sliced bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns, gravy (or hollandaise) sauce?, and of course fresh watermelon and cantaloupe to top it off.  A lot of food, and the quality was very good.  My brother's corned beef hash was good, but shockingly only a small portion.  You don't want to eat at this place too often, but when you want to indulge, this is the place!

The service was good, place wasn't too crowded when we went, and the food has awesome presentation!  Just look at the Yelp pictures!  No leftovers for me!"
1884,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Only 4/5 as we weren't absolutely blown away. HOWEVER, this is a great restaurant. Good food but HUGE GINORMOUS servings. If you are a light water or hate wasting food, share a plate with someone. Good was well cooked. Easy to find the restaurant within the Linq casino. Would recommend and come here again. 
Bonus - good yummy veggies options that don't rely on soy substitute stuff!!"
1885,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Came here during my 2 weeks at Las Vegas Hash House a go go it's over hyped, they got hugh portions but theyre lacking flavor in the flavor department. I ordered the following

Jumbo fried prawns 2/5 nothing special or stood out 

Rosemary chicken strips 3/5 just ok

Hardwood bacon avocado cheese burger 2/5 it's hugh but no flavor at all how sad 

Hash house Cobb salad 1/5 they don't use grilled chicken instead they used precooked chicken and also they don't have honey mustard dressing sauce

Service 4/5 my server was great but the food was lacking flavor and it won't have me coming back anytime soon

For spending almost $65.00 without leaving my server a $10.00 tip yet Hash house is over hyped and not even good. It's true they got gigantic portions but the way they execute their food is like coming from Cheesecake Factory bland, over hyped and disappointing."
1886,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing!!!  More food than I could dream of finishing, but every bite was incredible. This is a must-visit for breakfast!!"
1887,Hash House A Go Go,5,Never ever go to Vegas without a stop at Hash House.  Be brave and get the fried chicken benny or chicken and waffles.  Everything is super tasty anyway - the meatloaf is a fav also.  Just go -  this place is SO worth it.
1888,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place has the perfect hangover food. So on a Saturday at 11am this place is PACKED. They are REALLY STRICT on having all of your party there when they seat you. If you have even 1 person missing from your group they will not seat you. The place is very casual, no need to dress up or look cute. The portions are BIG and you get your moneys worth. I ordered a Watermelon Lemonade (I don't remember the exact name of the drink, it had no liquor in it) that was very refreshing. My friend got a S'mores Mocha that was soooo good. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was cooked perfectly. I was a little disappointed in the waffles. They put bacon in the waffles, which I was really looking forward to, but the bacon was soggy and not cooked all the way. My friends got the hash with chorizo which they enjoyed. Everything we ordered came out fast. The downsides for me were the soggy bacon, the loud music and there were a lot of kids. Other then that GREAT place. I would go back. Also, my friends and I all got bad cell phone service at this restaurant. So if you are meeting up with people make sure you all know where to meet. You will probably have to go downstairs to make a phone call."
1889,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place never fails us. 
A must go to spot to grub when in Vegas!
Had the Tenderloin Benedict, and fried chicken Benedict. Their signature bloody was tasty too. 
Super friendly, Service was great. We will be back every time we visit!"
1890,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So glad we finally found this place. It was delicious food, good prices and huge portions. We will return."
1891,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've eaten at Hash House before and it has always been great, but this review is all about the service.  Feeling a little hung over after a long night on the strip, i stopped in to get something hearty and delicious for breakfast this morning and Hash House was an easy choice.  When i looked at the menu I was a bit overwhelmed, as everything looked good.  This is where this excellent service came in to play.  After alerting my server, Sarah, to my dilemma she was able to suggest the perfect breakfast and experience.  She suggested I start with a peppercorn vodka bloody mary as an appetizer, which was ideal for my situation.  It was a total clutch move, Sarah is clearly a pro.  And when it came to my other beverages, my coffee and water were never empty as the service was very attentive.  For my main dish, Sarah suggested the Chorizo Hash, which was perfect.  It was also huge, and I only got through about half.  We ended up bagging up the remainder and I was assured the hash would make for an excellent left over meal.  Sarah was so in point with her suggestions, attitude and attentivness, I was happy and knew that I would be well taken care of everytime I saw her awesome red hair and smile come from around the corner.  Thanks again."
1892,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Visited for lunch. Portions were huge - 3 of us just ordered the famous waffle+fried chicken and a Caesar salad, and that made us all full. Both dishes were delicious. And the price was reasonable for a party of 3 (just above $30). 
Didn't quite like the dark lighting though. Service could be faster since it wasn't a full house but oh well, we were on vacation."
1893,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I guess I come here almost every time I'm in Vegas. They are always open so it's really nice to come eat here after a late night of partying. They have really big plates of everything, you should either be satisfied or not able to eat another bite full. Food is tasty, drinks are good, there's a lot to choose from."
1894,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I came on a Saturday morning around 930am. Long wait for groups of 2 or more. Thank goodness I was solo. I got a seat immediately at the bar, menu was a combo of breakfast and dinner plates. Price was a wee bit but no complaints when I got my food. I ordered the Indian favorites meatloaf with mashed potatoes scrambled eggs biscuits and fruit. Coffee and water. That plate was HUGE and the coffee was good. I felt bad I couldn't finish my plate until I seen others having the same issue. Every bit of it was very good. Lots of flavor and portions. Will return the next time I come out here."
1895,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place has some great food!  We came here for a late Sunday bunch and the wait was 45 minutes for two.  Our waitress was very friendly and definitely on top of what was going on, even though it was really busy. 

I got a basic breakfast and the eggs were done very well, the potatoes tasted great, and the bacon was pretty good.  Their homemade lemonade was tasty, too.

My girlfriend doesn't like eggs and was delighted to be able to get a savory breakfast (I think she got a chorizo scramble minus eggs). Big bonus there. 

The wait is the only thing that might keep me from coming back, and it's really noisy.  But the food is good enough that I would probably try to get back in at some point, but I would have to really be craving it.  I know that my girlfriend will want to come back next time we're here no matter what, so... I guess my opinion doesn't matter a whole bunch in this case!"
1896,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The date of this review is December 25, 2016.

On December 22, 2016, my wife and I, decided to have breakfast at the Hash House A Go Go Restaurant inside The LINQ Hotel & Casino. The restaurant is open 24/7. We arrived at 7:30 a.m. and there was no waiting line and we were seated immediate.

This being our first time at the Hash House, we were not aware that the portions were huge and that one plate would be enough for two people, so we ordered two items. My wife ordered the ""Blueberry Tract Over-Easy with Crispy Potatoes,"" $16.98, and I ordered the ""Steak & Eggs with Biscuit,"" $18.98. Mighty Lord, the portions are gigantic each enough to feed a battalion. The food was very delicious and finger licking good.

Our waitress was very cordial and attentive. The coffee cups as well as the glasses of water were promptly refilled. She constantly checked on us to make sure everything was in order.

Warning: Come very hungry and leave satisfied and contented. Our breakfast was worth every penny we paid.

Great food, excellent service. We strongly recommend the Hash House for breakfast! Hands down, this place exceeds the 5 stars rating from us!"
1897,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My girlfriend heard about this place from a friend. Once we heard about the humongous portions, we knew we had to come. 

When arrived at about 11 am after driving in from Los Angeles. This place was POPPIN. The wait was about 45 minutes so we went to the Irish Pub downstairs to grab a drink while we waited. We got seated at about the estimated wait they gave us. Kudos to the ladies working the waiting room. She was so energetic and they kept what is a mad house under control. 

Food: The Chicken and Waffles came in a huge plate that looked more like a mountain of food than anything. I split this with my girlfriend. The waffles had bacon cooked into it and it was bomb. The mix of the sweet syrup and salty bacon was fantastic! The chicken was perfect. Crispy, tender, flavorful! We also got a side of biscuits and gravy and that was delicious. The biscuit itself was OK, but the gravy was delicious!

My girlfriend got their watermelon cocktail and she loved it! I had a sip and it was very good. refreshing and not too sweet (which a lot of cocktail can be when they add the flavor syrup). It was so good she ordered on to go!

Service: Quick and friendly. They are pretty efficient here, but you have to be because they handle so many hungry people. 

Ambiance: Casual and busy. It was loud, but not overwhelming. Really cool decor. Enjoyed the vibe. 

If you are looking for a brunch spot and are not planning to eat the rest of the day definitely come here! You will not leave hungry. If you have leftovers, I hope you have a microwave in your hotel room!"
1898,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Be ready to fall into a coma. 

The grease and heaviness of the chicken and waffles and sage chicken was enough for us to go online to find a hotel so we could sleep off the oompa loompa feeling for a few hours. 

Service isn't that great and the lines are a complete cluster. Just make your way past the outside bar to the tiny hostess stand to put your name in; but if you blink, someone will cut right in front of you!"
1899,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The first time I ever tried this breakfast spot was in San Diego, CA and I was blown away by the huge portion sizes. At the time my best friend and I shared the Griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup. Trust me when I say that was more than enough for the two of us. This time I decided I would attempt to conquer any meal all on my own. 

I was a little indecisive between the Corned Beef with red onions and swiss cheese or The Big O Sage Fried Chicken and Waffle Tower (one of the most popular menu items) but the waiter was very helpful and suggested the Corned Beef. He was definitely right on that one too!

The day before we stopped by to see if we could get a quick bite to eat but after seeing all the people waiting outside we immediate changed our minds and turned around. This time we were a little more smart with our time and we showed up at 6am (hoping it would be off peak hours). I think that was the best decision because by the time we got our food more than half the room was filled. * Keep in mind this place is open 24/7 *

As the waiters pass by you, you're just in ahhhh with how much food is being dropped off on people's tables. One gentleman was asked to take a picture of these two guys and their breakfast plates. When he finished taking several pictures he said ""Good Luck"" because he knew that there was no way these guys were going to devour that in one sitting.

When our food arrived we immediately brought out our phones for pictures! There was no way we could even start eating these massive plates without documentation as proof that we at least attempted to eat these gigantic meals. The first plate that was dropped off in front of us was Andy's Famous Sage Fried Chicken Breast w/maple reduction, with two eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes and biscuits. The food is stacked so high up that a knife is placed vertically through the biscuit and chicken as a skewer to hold everything in place.  It's a sight to see! The Corned Beef arrived next. It was presented on a skillet that had melted cheese all over the shredded beef. Ahhhhh! And the eggs were cooked perfectly sunny side up so when you cut through and broke the yolks, it oozed all over the potatoes. Although it wasn't as impressive as the Fried chicken breast and biscuits it definitely was delicious.


This place serves so much food and has reasonable/ affordable prices in comparison to all other places located on the strip. It's crazy how much food gets uneaten but of course if you're going to try other restaurants you might want to leave the leftovers here."
1900,Hash House A Go Go,3,Don't know what the fuss is about. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffles were dry and the chicken was ok. If you really want chicken and waffles go to Roscos if you are ever in the L.A. area. I will say the portions are huge so take an appetite. Other than that I probably wouldn't go back.
1901,Hash House A Go Go,5,Extra large portions with extra large personalities.  The food was amazing and our waiter was HILARIOUS.  ages ranged from 26-85 in or party of 6 people.  I would absolutely go back.  Don't leave without trying a bloody marry.  Chicken and waffles is a sight to be seen and tried in person.
1902,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is a must go for breakfast. The food and drinks are both awesome.  The portion sizes are extremely big and the food was great.  You can't go wrong with the Chicken and Waffles.  We had good service and would definitely return.
1903,Hash House A Go Go,3,Huge portions and terrible service. We were seated pretty quickly but the server was completely inattentive. I think she had too many tables going on. The corn beef hash was pretty tasty and the chicken and waffles were good. It had an interesting rosemary flavor but both were a little dry. Also I was expecting the ambiance to be more cutesy but it was like a dark diner.
1904,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Their plates are huge! I enjoyed the Andys special and the bloody Mary's came with bacon, lettuce an tomato on a plate with a piece of bread.. pretty clever!"
1905,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow! The Mac n cheese hamburger was amazing! The price is a bit high for a hamburger, but it's freakin worth it. The trash can nachos ( I think that's the name ) were pretty good also. The service was good, but the weather sucks. I had to sit outside, but they had a water mist, which helped out. The food is worth coming back. I definitely recommend coming."
1906,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here based on yelp ratings and unfortunately was pretty disappointed.  Hash House A Go Go is a breakfast/brunch chain restaurant.  This specific location is in the new Linq hotel & casino on the Vegas strip.  The line to this place is crazy long.  We must have came during the right time because they were calling out tables rapidly.  We were told it was a 30 to 45 minute wait, but got in within ten.

Naturally, my boyfriend and I ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken benedict.   My boyfriend loves fried chicken and it was featured in a Man V. Food episode.  Portion size was ginormous.  It feed my boyfriend and I.  If we had a child it would also feed our child and our child's child.  Seriously, the plate was ridiculous.  Nonetheless, I think you sacrifice flavor for portion in this case.  Flavor wise, there was nothing memorable about our entree.  I wanted to like it, but I didn't.

I did, however, like the staff.  They were fun and entertaining."
1907,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Everything on the menu comes large and in charge. Unless you are Man vs Food caliber, expect to share or bring home leftovers. I did exactly that and shared my fried chicken eggs benedict with my boo thang. All in all it was very satisfying. What I can tell is that their fried chicken is very good. The batt contains corn flakes in it and the chicken stays juicy and moist yet fully cooked. In some ways the fried chicken is better than roscoe's (but that is up to debate, imo roscoe's) 

What was a pleasant delight was there BLT Bloody Mary. Containing a slice of bacon and lettuce (just because) and a side of toast.. honestly it probably was just the presentation of the bacon and toast added to the drink but it made the experience of drinking their bloody mary so much more enjoyable. Getting all of the Ooh and Aahs when served to my table was also nice, and quite honestly, the attention you get is half of the payoff, am i right?

Our server had a crazy mohawk which was totally awesome, he was happy to answer questions about it also which was very nice of him. Ive been here a couple times and it has never disappointed. 

If you don't know what to get, get the chicken and bacon waffles. It seems to be their most popular dish. FYI, this place was on Man vs. Food, no challenge just giving credit where credit is due."
1908,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Absolutely amazing all around. Excellent service, HUGE portion sizes and all of our food was delicious! I ordered the chicken and waffles and didn't expect so much food! 2 huge chicken breasts and 6 waffles. Omg! Needless to say I couldn't finish it. My bf ordered an Avocado burger that he could barely fit in his mouth lol. Service was great, food was great, I highly recommend eating here! Huge thanks to our server, Brian who was also wonderful."
1909,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This was my first time at this spot and as we waited our 45 minute to 1 hour wait, I said never again. This place was packed! I kept rereading the yelp reviews to determine if we should leave or not. Thankfully we had seats and my mother said she didn't mind waiting.  I kept seeing a separate line where people were just walking in with no wait. I went to ask and was informed it was for patrons with VIP cards from certain casinos. This penny playing only machine gal didn't bother to check her membership cards and just continued to wait. Lol. 

Once we were finally seated, my frown went to a smile. We had a very sweet server who recommended our one dish that she confirmed was definitely shareable with two people, woo hoo. The restaurant was fairly big and every seat was taken.  I was in awe of the huge platters on other customers table. The huge stack of chicken and waffles caught my eye as I saw three women share that meal, it was tall like a tower.

My mom and I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. Everything was delicious but the bacon mash potatoes were exceptional. We ate our shared meal with full bellies and a little food left on the plate. I can honestly say the wait was worth it. I would love to return again with a big group to get a chance to taste a variety of dishes."
1910,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food was so heavy I could build a house with it. The waiter was friendly but absent most the time. They were busy but not to busy to check on coffee and food quality I feel. It's also very loud in here, don't expect to have an intimate conversation here! It's also pretty pricy, even for Vegas."
1911,Hash House A Go Go,4,Awesome food! I got the scrambler. Cant wait to go back!
1912,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The dynamic of this restaurant was great and haven't seen anything like it before. The service was great and the portions are massive so come hungry (literally)! I ordered their Sage Fried Chicken that came with biscuits, bacon, spinach, tomato, chipotle cream sauce, and mashed potatoes. The chicken itself was more on the dryer side and unsure if they cooked it too long or simply didn't marinate it enough before frying it but it wasn't that great. However, the mashed potatoes and the cream sauce was delicious! The bacon seemed more like jerky and slightly salty. The meal itself was big and could've fed a good two hungry people. The price was about $18.99 plus tax so it was pretty affordable for the amount of food I received. All in all, it's a great spot to check out and they have cocktails too."
1913,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food here is amazing, and the portions are absolutely insane.  You get so much food for the money. I end up feeling guilty about not being able to finish what I order.  You're always going to have to wait a while for a seat, which I don't mind.

That being said, I wish Yelp would give me the option to leave a 4 1/2 star review because while I don't mind the wait for a table, it takes absurdly long to get your food once you order. I know that they make things fresh to order, but there is no way it should take them so long to get the food out.  But, since I love the food so much, I won't short them by leaving them a half-star less than what I think they deserve."
1914,Hash House A Go Go,4,Loved this place! Bloody Mary's are a must! Hard to find but worth the walk and the wait!
1915,Hash House A Go Go,4,Wow! The portions are out of control. Make sure you are hungry when you come here. The wait took about 1.5hrs to get in. But over all it was good
1916,Hash House A Go Go,2,Atmosphere is ok. Service pretty good. Unfortunately the food is like off of an assembly line. I fell in love with this chain in San Diego and walked past many other restaurants on the Vegas strip to eat here and was seriously disappointed. Nothing like back home. Never again
1917,Hash House A Go Go,1,Horrible service. Our waitress sucked and the food wasn't all that great. One star and that's only cause I'm feeling nice
1918,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I am so happy that we decided to get food here! Seriously everything I tried was so pretty and delicious. 
We got the chicken and waffles, chorizo harsh, and watermelon kiwi lemonade. 
The chicken and waffle was huge and it was very good! The chicken was crispy and moist. There was four pieces of waffles stacked on the bottom. The waffles were cooked perfection. Not to mention, it had strips of bacon cooked into it.
The chorizo hash was so good and was perfect after a week of drinking. The hash came with a large tortilla, fruits, and two eggs. 
You have to try their watermelon kiwi lemonade. It was so pretty. It had three layers of color and a slice of watermelon as garnish. 
The service was great and it's open 24 hours! I wish we found this place earlier because I would have gone here every night after drinking."
1919,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Absolutely disgusting. Burger came out cold, meat was overcooked, quality of food was below average. Really disappointed with this place.

From out of town, didn't have high expectations, still was let down.

Only plus was a nice waiter and manager was reasonable when my party complained.

Absolutely disgusting food. Don't eat here.
Your body will hate you for it."
1920,Hash House A Go Go,5,We loved this place. We love breakfast foods and decided to try this place out first thing when we got to vegas. Got seated right away. Very quick service and the food was out within ten minutes. Gigantic portions. You could definitely split a meal with two or three people. Everything was super tasty and very reasonably priced. Would definitely come back here.
1921,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food great sometimes the service can be a little poor sorry guys from San Diego where hash out a gogo originally started just saying if you got to do it do it right plus me they had to tear that you're from San Diego and that you been to the original one they have better customer service there but the lines are longer and they're not open 24 hours a day at the links
1922,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I saw it on Food Network, and read reviews, my friend from out of town came to vegas, and we hit this place up right away. I was hungry and so was he. We wanted something massive. So I knew what I wanted, Chicken & Waffles, and he got meatloaf. I was impressed not only by the flavor but by the presentation. The Chicken was crispy, flavorful, and the Waffles was cooked in a batter, that had bacon in it..pretty EPIC.. it was like art, who would of known CHicken and waffles..art? lol anyways. this location is 1-2$ more per plate compared to the W. Sahara one. That was my only complaint. then again it was on the STRIP. Suprisingly when I went on a Saturday Night, it was real empty. so we got our food out right away."
1923,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place never disappoints! I returned here with some friends who had never been to vegas before and they agreed it was worth the walk from the other end of the strip.  The sage chicken Benedict is a must try. I always go for my red velvet flap jack, and the other person in my group had a stuffed cheeseburger which looked amazing also.  Next time we may get fewer plates to share, but we all agreed that we would need to return because so many items looked so good on the menu!"
1924,Hash House A Go Go,3,"You have to come very early to avoid having to wait, and it can be a very long time from what I've seen.  The portions  are very very large.  I ordered chicken fried steak.  The meat was very chewy.  My friend ordered the corned beef hash.  Instead of the typical chopped meat, it came in strands.  I did not like that.  It's something you have to try once. It's pricy for breakfast."
1925,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had the mushroom hash.  A little bland.  Could have used more seasoning.  Biscuits where tasty.  Hubbie has the chicken hash.  He said the chicken had a good flavor .  Large portions .  Relaxed vibe.  Open 24 hours .  Our tickets was lost so it did take a while for the food to come out.  Overall okay.  Busy place , service was good."
1926,Hash House A Go Go,2,When u order pancakes make sure you order the junior size the regular one is too big ok food if you like over rated places
1927,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food.  Poor service since they were so busy.  I would definitely go back for the pancakes!
1928,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome choice for brunch, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Food portions are HUGE - really!  You can order one dish and split it with a second person.  Waitress said many people do that.  We ordered for breakfast the corned beef hash platter with two eggs, large biscuit, potatoes, fruits (one meal), along with two separate coffees.  Cost was $22 plus tip.  

The food quality is excellent, and, YES, I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

Marie and I split the meal.  Portions were so big that we had food left over after the split meal.

Come hungry!"
1929,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food, huge portions, had a delicious Bloody Mary... What more could you ask for in a Las Vegas restaurant?"
1930,Hash House A Go Go,5,Loved this place...it was a bit complicated to get to...it's in the middle of Imperial Palace. I ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles. I was a bit surprised to find bacon inside of the waffles...you may want to request plain waffles. My husband ordered Snicker flapjacks...we both wasted a lot of food and that usually doesn't happen. Their portions are gigantic!
1931,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Literally, just got back from dining here & it was delicious!  Went solo & grabbed a seat at the bar as soon as I walked in - although the place was PACKED!!  Crystal & Mark were my bartendars/servers & they were awesome!  Had the sundried-tomato, basil & goat cheese scramble with potatoes & a biscuit.  And what meal would be complete without a pineapple mimosa - YUM!  It was so good I'm going back & taking my boyfriend with me!"
1932,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome breakfast place!  I had French Toast, eggs, bacon...yummm!  Worth the wait!  Great service as well."
1933,Hash House A Go Go,4,Heard this was a good place to eat so I decided to make it the first place I went to when I got off the plane. The wait was about 30-45min but it was so worth it. I had the chicken and waffles and was blown away by how big the portions were and how succulent the chicken breast was also . I forgot to take pics to post but I promise that when you eat the food you will be in love !
1934,Hash House A Go Go,4,"wish there was one in San Jose, CA! came here during my stay in vegas and it was delicious! I had one of their scrambles, cant remember which one but it was absolutely delicious! Portions are big and the food is amazing! Would have given 5 stars but the service was slow and decent. Other than that 4 starts for great food! Will be back next time I visit vegas and want breakfast."
1935,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went into HH LV with my heart set on the French Toast with banana cream, pecans, whipped cream. It was dinner and not on the menu. Inquired with the server if I could get it anyway. She politely declined, with reason. I asked her to please inquire with the chef if he would make it for me and she came back to the table with a big yes! Thank you  Krystie, great server, great attitude. Thank you chef!"
1936,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was a highly recommended place to try from several people. The menu is exciting enough to get me through the door and the food did not disappoint either. 4 of us split 3 plates and probably would have been fine sharing 2. We ordered the brown sugar banana pancake, the chicken pot pie and the chicken and waffles. Let me start by saying the waffles has bacon cooked into it and not just little tiny shreds. The bacon makes those waffles. The chicken wasn't the best friend chicken I've had and we probably got the last of a batch (we can at the end of brunch/lunch), but some pieces were good. The pancake is a must have. It's the size of a medium pizza and perfectly fluffy with a giant serving of fresh whipped cream on the side. I also ordered a pint of mimosa and was the perfect ratio of OJ and bubbly. I'm excited to come back on my next trip to Vegas."
1937,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food , great service. Anything on the menu is worth the price and worth ordering. Make reservations is all I've gotta say. There is always a wait"
1938,Hash House A Go Go,3,The food was great and our waiter Greg was amazing but the only reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because the bus boy or a addistant waiter named Jason was very rude ... Everytime we tried getting his attention he would purposely ignore us and when we made sure we got his attention his was rude .. Made smirky comments never said you're welcome when we said thank you.. And when we would ask for some items he would just go get whatever he had to get without saying anything you could tell he was pissed off honestly if it wasn't for him this would have been 5 stars but he totally killed my vibe
1939,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I loved this place, great food and good portions. Be prepared for a long wait but so worth it. Just wake up with no makeup and head over there becuz no one cares how ur face looks like in the morning... especially in Vegas. Service was kindof slow but it can be becuz this place was packed!!! Great breakfast menu, and reasonable prices."
1940,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I've have ate here over 2 dozen times over the years. Sometimes it's okay but overall a 2 star for many reasons. 
 
I wish I could give it a better review but there is so many problems with this place. It's a bummer because I live nearby and it's the only restaurant that is allowed to serve breakfast at the Rio.

The hours are terrible; It closes way to early even when conventions are going, and even during the wsop. 

The service is okay at the bar because the pretty red head and guy that run it most of the time do pretty good. Besides the bar the service has always been very lacking. 

Even with my diamond it took awhile to get seated the last two times I went. After seated it took well over 5 minutes, almost 10 just to get water. Another couple walked out and I wanted to follow them but was to hungry.

They are so bad at getting your eggs cooked to your request. If you order over easy, over medium, and over medium well they seem to all come out cooked the same, rushed out very runny and certainly over easy no matter what. They just don't try and rush to get thing on the plate.

I believe this place could be better but there is poor management for sure. They manager must treat employees poorly and only comes in to collect the money so it is ruining a place that could be so much better. 

They say your food is cooked to order but that is a flat out lie. They have your potatoes pre cooked, biscuits are cold and very bad tasting. It's huge but but so dry and very bland to match all the food. 

Portions are large but prices are way to high. Many things are not worth it while others are just a waste of food. Giving me a pile of pre-made, non seasoned potatoes does not impress me. I've tried many of the dishes, the meatloaf is probably the best but nothing special.

I will eat here again and will update or add to the review because I frequent the Rio often but I avoid this place and never order a drink when I go since it won't get refilled. 4 of us had empty waters for so long with no service, we could not get them refilled at all, even the 7yo drank all hers. The waitress just dropped the check dropped and ran off. 

I'd avoid this place if I were you.

Take care"
1941,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I have to say, when i first came here, I'd expected that the food would be mediocre and plain since they are at first and foremost well known for their huge portions of every dish. Yes, I was a great skeptic and also I love great breakfast foods. So to say that my judging for good breakfast food would be a bit harsh.

However, after trying out the Hash House Benedict, I was hooked. They stack the biscuit, bacon, and mash potato into a large stack with same shredded basil on top, as well as a good helping of their special benedict sauce. I like that little side of spicy red sauce that i did notice until i rubbed that on my food which gave a small kick to it but wasn't too spicy.

I would most definitely come back again and try out one of there really large portions. Specially their pancakes."
1942,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Banana Brown Sugar Pancake, HUGE and OMG SO GOOD!!! French Toast, HUGE and OMG SO GOOD!! 1LB Applewood Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Stuffed Burger-HUGE AND SO SO GOOD!! No trip to Vegas is ever complete without getting our fix here. The best, Love it!"
1943,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm just blown away!
Super awesome dining out experience. Our server Carolina was terrific, knew her menu well, had great suggestions, food was served spot on. Great presentation. 
Loved it!!"
1944,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Simply love this place. There isn't a single item that I've tried that I haven't loved. Portions are out of control, and the prices aren't bad (less than $20) per entree.  I'm glad its in IP now so I don't have to leave the strip.  Also, as with anything in Vegas, if you don't want to wait, an extra tip goes a long way.

Top Choices
-Breakfast - Fried Chicken Benedict. If you only come here once, you have to get this.
-Lunch/Dinner - The Meatloaf pasta is amazing, huge flavor in the pesto/basil/tomato and oil they put over the linguini.
The Chicken pot pie is also amazing. It's like an endless, flaky bowl of chicken and vegetables.

I could eat every meal here, except the buffets get in the way."
1945,Hash House A Go Go,2,"All I can say is to stock up on some GasâX Extra Strength pills before eating here. OMG!!! It's comfort food to the max gas. The portions may be huge, but the feeling your left with will ruined the rest of your day! I'm just saying! see pic!"
1946,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We loved this place. The only bad thing was that we couldn't get everything on the menu.  The portion sizes are giant and can easily be shared by 2-3 people.  Our server told us this before we ordered which was great because she wasn't trying to upsell anything! To be honest the prices are so reasonable that we each ordered a dish. My husband got the meatloaf hash and I got the biscuits and gravy. They were both amazing and giant portions but a great deal for the price. Go there,  try anything, you won't be disappointed!"
1947,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food is great and the service only makes it better! Since we found Hash House it's a must-eat when in Vegas!! House Hashes are my go to!! Had the mushroom, artichoke, sundried tomato, spinach house hash and it was DELICIOUS!! My tip is to put the biscuit that's served with your meal (served with many meals) and put it into a box immediately along with some spoonfuls of the homemade jam! You don't want to miss it so doing this allows you to eat most of your meal and save the biscuit and jam as a wonderful afternoon memory of lunch! As I said, service is always spot on. I sat at the bar top and Cai (maybe Ky??) took great care of me! Always on top of anything I needed. If you're going during breakfast hours (which for Vegas is like 9-11am with the hungover crowd) MAKE A RESERVATION! Once you go, you'll never miss a trip!"
1948,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great, great, great breakfast spot.  My wife and I hit this place for Mother's Day and she loved it.  We had a watermelon drink that was well worth it.  I had their signature chicken and waffles and it was outstanding.  If your in Vegas you must take time and hit one of the locations for breakfast."
1949,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Diamond in the rough... really it is because it's tucked away inside the Imperial Palace... which I will talk about in a separate review, but anyway, my friends and I were starved after having spent the morning at the pool playing a friendly game of pool volley with some nice tourists. We were really lazy to go back up to the room to get ready and head out for lunch, so we decided to stick close by, so we took the escalator upstairs and arrived at this place. We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving in a nice little crescent booth tucked in the back. My best friend had tried this place before on a previous trip to Vegas, and recommended it, & me, being such a huge fan of chicken and waffles, I had to come taste what all the commotion was about! My best friend and I shared the chicken and waffles plate and our other friend had one to himself, we barely finished ours since the portion size is HUMONGOUS (probably could feed 3 people). The chicken breading was really flavorful and had a nice crispy crunch to it, but the white chicken meat inside was a bit on the dry side, so we asked  for some more of the sauce, which is divine by the way! The waffles were really tasty as well! Out waiter was really nice and filled our drinks accordingly. My overall experience here was a positive one! Must come back and bring my fiancÃ©! He would appreciate it and enjoy it just as much as I did!"
1950,Hash House A Go Go,3,"By far the best bang for your buck on the Strip. $15 for the most humongous plates, like chicken and waffles? That's why there's always a line here, even at odder times of the day. But still worth it because you can probably share the dishes and be full! They are indeed that huge.

That said, we paid decently on the cocktails, and I didn't really like my electric blue sports drink cocktail (forgot the name). I think out of my friends, we only got 1 drink we liked. The waffles were pretty good, but I found the chicken to be pretty dry. Probably because I'm from the South and love my fried chicken juicy and greasy, but oh well."
1951,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very busy restaurant, but the food is very good. Large servings for the price and the service was pretty good also. The only problem I had was the French fries were warm and not hot."
1952,Hash House A Go Go,5,"AMAZING!!!!! The chicken and waffles was just amazing!!!!! The portion is big so 2 persons can share. The chicken is cooked to perfection! Delicious! The waffles have bacon inside and are incredible. And topped with long green onions, wasn't sure how that would taste with chicken and waffles but it was delicious!! My only complaint was the wait but it was well worth it! My husband and I waited 1 1/2 hr but we gambled meanwhile. We dined at the LinQ location. Would definitely recommend it!!"
1953,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place would have gotten 3 or 4 stars, if it wasn't for the super irritating experience with the host.  We arrived on Thursday at 6:45 AM, with our infant son. (traveling with my husband on business) This was why we were up so early, so yeah we were very tired.  (Unlike the majority of the dining room which was smathered with rogue drunks and dodgy-looking 20 somethings who were there basically because they never went to bed).  I smelled smoke and asked host for non-smoking, evidently it was just leaching in from the casino.  Anyway, there were two ""open"" sections, the bar side and non-bar side. The rest of the dining room was evidently closed, as I was simply told ""that's closed."" when I requested a seat in the back, as we were led directly into the loudest pit of drunks in the dining room by teenage host.  What disturbs me the most is I honestly felt like BECAUSE I requested something, (to be away from the loud/crazy people), my family was placed directly BY the loud/crazy people.  I also felt like this incident was a disapproving nod towards the fact that I chose to travel with an infant (GASP!)  in Vegas.  We were placed right NEXT to (within 3 feet of) the loudest, most rowdy gaggle in the entire restaurant. Even the other drunk people seemed to be annoyed by this group. Either the host had some weird superiority complex, or he hadn't even the faintest idea how to BE a host. You are a HOST!!  Your job description is to make guests feel comfortable. It's what you do.  It looked like it might have been his first job, but if that was the case, why the attitude? 

So then we tried to move.  First, we protested to host directly a second time when we arrived at our table. (Could we possibly go to the more quiet -bar side-of the dining room?).  He shook his head, and made some crappy excuse about servers and turns, then disappeared. I've spent over 20 years in the hospitality industry. This was inappropriate. My husband kept saying ""Let's just go"", but I really wanted to try the chicken and waffles, (my jam) and I was starving.  So we asked again, this time to a waiter passing by. Waiter was very friendly, but it was so loud (again the riff raff) he literally could NOT HEAR ME.  I gestured to our son trying to explain we needed a different seat, and he thought we were just showing him our baby!!  Finally as a last ditch attempt, I literally got up and found yet another employee to ask, again a server (no manager in sight). He replied with ""yeah, basically my whole section is drunk"", then finally took action and asked bartender if we could sit on her side.  Over saunters boy host, butting in as he sees me trying to escape our assigned seats, yet again. I kid you not. He THEN directed us to sit at a table on the OTHER SIDE of the drunks we were trying to escape from!!  There were open tables ALL OVER the bar section. It didn't matter where we sat, the bartender was serving everyone in her section. My husband was in disbelief.  I was fed up, and told host ""no way"" this time, and we promptly sat at the next table over. What was this guys problem? How very rude.  Chicken was delish and then waffles were hard and ice cold, such a bummer, when you're spending 50 bones on breakfast. Would have wrote the incident off as me being over-sensitive and host being ""out to lunch"", but then he looked up and ignored us, continuing a casual conversation with the girl at the front counter as we left. No professional thank you or goodbye. Hash House will be a definite NO GO next time."
1954,Hash House A Go Go,5,They have the best BACON WAFFLES!!  Portions are huge and the prices are so reasonable for a restaurant in a Casino!
1955,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I wish i was making this up, total disaster.
Service decent but not great, waiter never checked on us except to walk past and ask if the food was good.
It wasn't and maybe that's when i should have said something but the guy didn't really seem like he cared what the answer was.
Ordered bacon and eggs benedict came covered in a red sauce, marinara sauce on eggs benedict?? and it tasted really bad. they said they don't have hollandaise omg. last time i came here they did and it was awesome. This time i just asked for a side of gravy and tried to salvage my biscuits. 4.00 charge to make this dish edible.
My friends breakfast was served with the egg very undercooked, i understand sunny side up but like at least turn the heat on in the pan. 
I had been telling him how great this place is and man now do i have egg on my face.
I can't believe how much of a letdown this was. They have not just gone downhill they have gone from one of the best places to get a good meal on the strip to a place i loathe. 

But  even though this has hurt me deeply I still remember the good times fondly.
RIP Hash House"
1956,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of the BEST breakfast spot in Las Vegas. All the portions are HUGE. Excellent is top notch. Will come again. Little bit of a wait, but it is worth."
1957,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The fried chicken is the star here. Had the fried chicken benedict and sauce on the side-great decision as there is a lot of sauce. A lot of carbs here with both biscuits and mashed potatoes included-portions are really large. It's rather loud and plan on a decent wait both to be seated and to get your food-it's pretty popular, packed on a Monday morning during the offseason, and they make everything fresh, to order."
1958,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Definitely one of the best places for breakfast in Vegas.  The wait was about 30 minutes, but they move people through really quickly.  My husband had their famous meatloaf breakfast and said it was amazing. Their biscuits and homemade strawberry preserves were so good.  We would definitely go here again."
1959,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was a nice surprise to find. Almost didn't stay because the air was broken but glad that we did. (it felt like it was +80F, but were told that the hotel hasn't fixed that air it has been broke for a while.)

Food was well plated & overly portioned to where 2-3 people can easily share anything that we ordered. Great combinations and food selections and being that it's open 24x7 you can order breakfast anytime."
1960,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is the best breakfast chain in Las Vegas. Ate breakfast here for the first time after hearing soo much about it.. Waiter helped us on ordering and man This place will be a for sure stop everytime I come to vegas.. Food was great, customer service was great and price was decent.. Totally recommend this spot.."
1961,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It was super packed and long wait but the food was good and huge portions. The sage chicken was a famous one there I mean it was good but it wasn't super blow my mind. Also don't eat anything from anyone else plates if you eat the sage chicken n waffles cuz it tastes kind of weird, but when I tried it later it was good. The brown sugar pancakes were so good! My friend had the corned beef and the cinnamon toast they're both good."
1962,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Ordered the chicken and waffles. A big mass of mush and cheese. Nothing about this that we would ever wrap our lips around again. My son ordered the pancake..it was HUGE, fluffy and yum. Go at your own risk. LOL!"
1963,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I always recommend Hash House for a good breakfast and I'm not a huge fan of breakfast food. The BLT Bloody Mary is so yummy. I always get the mushroom, artichoke heart, sun dried tomato, spinach hash. But then I add garlic, onion, mozzarella and sausage. It's to die for!!!! Please go if you want a good breakfast!!!"
1964,Hash House A Go Go,1,Got the worst food poisoning from this place. All I had was the cheeseburger. Our server was really nice but I spent majority of my first trip to Vegas throwing up in my hotel room. Never again.
1965,Hash House A Go Go,3,"At first look, the pictures of the food that are hanging near the entrance of the restaurant look horrible but the food turned out pretty good. I had the sage fried chicken with waffles. This dish did not meet my expectations. The chicken was bland and there wasn't anything especially good about the tower of bacon waffles. HOWEVER, the Tractor Driver Combo with the brown sugar banana flapjack was delicious. The griddled french toast was also great. Also the watermelon kiwi drink is a must have."
1966,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait was so long but so worth it! My best friend and I came here during lunch. 

Once we got seated our server quickly took our order! We ordered the chicken and waffles and two teas (green tea and peppermint tea.) The chicken was surprisingly juicy!! Because most of the time white meat is known to be dry.

Everything was delicious!!! Will be coming back!"
1967,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Tried Hash House a Go Go based on Yelp and Frommer's Guide recommendations. The smores hot chocolate was quite tasty- if a little weird when stray chunks of soggy graham cracker ended up in the swallow. Vanilla waffles were very good, as was the Andy's sage chicken breakfast.  Portions are gigantic- two could easily share one meal. Prices very reasonable for such a large meal on the strip. Definitely recommend coming here, but as another reviewer said, iPhone map didn't work well. Find the Quad and follow signs once inside. No wait at 8:00 AM for us."
1968,Hash House A Go Go,5,"+ Some of the best service I've had, period, and the best we had in Vegas, far surpassing all of our super expensive indulgences.

+ Went 11 on a Friday morning, was told there'd be a 15 min wait, waited 10 or less.

+ Maybe the best breakfast I've had, period. Split the chicken and waffles. Still couldn't finish it all. Also tried a couple of the scrambles that friends got, and were delicious. The biscuits were wonderful, too.

+ Drinks were some of the best I've had, period, and the best we had in Vegas. We got the spiked watermelon lemonade, both juices fresh. It came in a glass that you get to keep and is actually super neat, and nice quality. The booze is something like 20 oz and strong - and that with the glass is $12.95. If you ask me, that is not bad. 

Heads up that it is in a super random spot in the middle of the Imperial Palace casino, so kinda hard to find.

I would like to give a special shout out to our waiter. I will come back and add his name if I can find my receipt. He was so attentive, helpful, friendly, everything, had great suggestions, didn't mind that we asked him to take like 50 pics, offered to put the second watermelon lemonade we ordered for the road (because they were that good) into several cups so we could all share. Truly a nice guy.

Probably the only thing I will miss in Vegas. Please open more!!!!!"
1969,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place has TOO LARGE of servings.  Should that be a complaint?   hmmmm not sure but really it is.  I found out the scraps are given to pig farmers.  Pretty cool right?  But there are hungry people outside too.   Okay off of my humanitarian trip and onto the food.  

The food is really tasty and has a nice presentation. The dishes are EASILY shareable, so keep that in mind when you are ordering especially if you are staying in a hotel.  You may not have a place to store and heat up any leftovers depending on your room.  

The service is wonderful.  Everyone has big smiles and are very friendly and helpful."
1970,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We had mixed reactions to this extremely popular place. I loved my  corned beef sandwich with carmalized onions, accompanied by delicious crispy fries. But  my husband was not impressed with his Sage Fried Chicken  Benedict, which they are famous for. The bottom was a pile of smashed potatoes, topped with enormous biscuit , fried chicken breast, spinach, tomato, bacon and chipotle sauce. It was massive and the presentation was very dramatic but it was just okay. With that many ingredients there should have been an explosion of flavors, but the starches just seemed to absorb all of the flavor. Chicken was dry - we were puzzled by all the accolades. Probably won't return."
1971,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When in doubt for breakfast options in the early afternoon: Hash House was today's jackpot! After patiently waiting just 10 min to be seated and having a great server who guided my party and me through the menu, I decided to order the salmon scramble...it hit the spot! The parmesan-garlic mashed potatoes were also amazing, and such a portion I couldn't finish it! I even shared a order of their French toast with my party, and it was just wonderful with the banana, pecans, butter and syrup it came out with! I'm so glad when I can have a day where I make good food choices!"
1972,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love everything I've ever eaten. The portions are huge so I love to get a yummy comfort food I can eat on a couple times and take home like the chicken pot pie, the meatloaf, and even the chicken and waffles are ridiculously good."
1973,Hash House A Go Go,4,Hope you're hungry! The portion sizes here are out of this world. I ha a pancake that took up 1/4th of the table and my husband had biscuits and gravy with a side of chicken. The chicken was well seasoned (ask for a side of the Cajun/Chipotle gravy!).The food is pretty good and service was decent for the amount of people in there. Lots of seating!
1974,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love this place for breakfast!  Haven't had any other meal here but I'm sure it's just as good as the breakfast since there's always a pretty long wait no matter what time you come!

The food definitely deserves five stars but I'm rating the entire experience so I have to knock off a star for service.  I think you're pretty safe to order just about anything on the menu and it will be wonderfully satisfying.  To me, the Hand Hammered Port Tenderloin is the absolute best choice and I've ordered it just about every time we've been here!  I take the liberty of sampling everybody else's choices though so I've eaten quite a few menu items.  No matter what I order though, I'll make sure it comes with the mashed potatoes because I tell you what, those are the absolute best!

Service however isn't the greatest.  It's sort of slow and sometimes really really hard to get!  It's always packed and I understand they are busy but maybe management needs to have a few more workers on the floor that can actually help the diners.  There were four workers cleaning tables and sweeping the floor that couldn't even fill our water glasses!  The servers are also pretty territorial and really won't help unless you're in their section.  That being said, they are all super friendly and smile a lot so it kind of makes you not realize you're not being helped!  It's definitely not bad enough to make me ever say I won't return, it's just not that great and people should know what to expect so I'm throwing it out there!

Make sure you are hungry when you arrive and don't drink too much either because the portions are enormous!!  I'd say share an entree with somebody else but darn it, then you wouldn't get to sample more of their great cuisine!"
1975,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious! Place was a little busy when we arrived so there was a wait. But boy was it totally worth every minute of waiting. I had the chicken blue cheese Salad which was packed full of flavor. From the smoked tender chicken with little crunchy bits of applewood bacon, tossed with chunks of blue cheese and tomatoes. To top it off the dish comes with a biscuit and fresh strawberry jam. The biscuit was tender and buttery. I was completely and utterly satisfied. So much so days later I am craving the taste. Service was speedy and polite, we had a big group which they handled well and with care and attention to detail seeing as one member was a allergic to  dairy. I would definitely recommend stopping by if your in this area of town. Also the prices for the portion size it's crazy you get so much food!"
1976,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This has become a must every time that I go to Vegas. The food and atmosphere are always amazing and so worth the wait (which is usually a lot less than they tell you, so eat a little bit before or bring a snack and you will be in your seat in no time!).This time I decided to get their fried chicken salad, as in all the years I had been here I've never had one of their salads, so I had to try! I asked the waitress if I could have more spinach than iceberg lettuce and she said ""sure'. When she brought out the salad of course it was huge and was meant for three people versus just one. I decided to tackle the salad like Adam on man vs. food; and of course food won. The salad came with a sweet and tangy mustard sauce, that I got on the side, and it was filled with greens, blue cheese, cherry red tomatoes, and a huge chicken breast that I cut up into small pieces and tossed in the salad. It came with one of their awesome and flaky biscuits on the side. I asked for jam and butter; and when I cut and bit into the warm biscuit with the jam and butter it just melted. I ended up taking most of the salad and half of the biscuit home--I am still eating on it! 

I would recommend Hash House A Go Go for anyone wanting great quality and quantity food at a great price. (my salad was only $14!) It is a Vegas staple and a fun place to check out! I definitely recommend sharing an entrÃ©e."
1977,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait was long (at least you can gamble in the lobby while you wait?), but it was worth it! I was super hungover and super hungry. I ordered the biggest biscuit with gravy I have ever seen. It was really good --- but really needed another cup of gravy on top. I also ordered the sausage which was flavorful and bit spicy, scrambled eggs which were nice and creamy, and the apple pancake, which was big enough to keep a newborn child warm at night as a blanket. However, the apple pancake wasn't very ""apple-y"". It had some thin strips of apple in it, but didn't taste like apple. What would have really helped is sort of like an apple-pie-ish apple in there --- seasoned with lots of cinnamon, brown sugar, and butter. Instead it was just kind of a regular pancake, which was good, but I paid a few dollars extra to make it a special ""apple"" pancake. Wasn't worth the upgrade.

That's sort of where they're missing out on that 5th star. Needed more gravy with my biscuit and needed more apple flavor with my apple pancake upgrade. That said, the pancake itself was the PERFECT texture --- springy without being rubbery...moist without being goopy.

And the service was excellent. Our waitress was really nice and attentive and even brought me extra syrup when I (obviously) had to box most of my pancake. I wanna try the fried chicken next time!"
1978,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I am a real fan of hash house and as many times that I have eaten there I have never left a yelp review. The food is ALWAYS tasty and plentiful and the service always meets our expectations. However, this morning was one of the best dining experiences I had while in Vegas. Our server's name was Scotty and he provided outstanding service. From the great recommendations to checking on us. I think he's a trainer or something like that which goes to show why he would be the perfect person for the job. Often times, people feel the need to share bad service, but in Scotty's case I knew I wanted people to know the good."
1979,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Got the man vs food ""Andy's Sage Burger"" which is a monster of a meal. I would take it with extra cream. The chicken and waffles looked pretty good too."
1980,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I have heard people say this place is food coma central. Came here after a night of fun and decided to get some food. 

Food: 
Sage fried chicken and waffle. This was a huge plate and what felt like a mountain of food, but that did not intimate me. I was ready to dig in and was definitely impressed. The flavor was good and everything worked well together.  roscoe chickens and waffle is definitely better in my book. This dish was around $15- 16 and i think it is worth your money to try this place once. 

Service
We were seated pretty quickly, but then again it was 4 am. The staff here was attentive and ensure we were comfortable and got what we needed. 

There is no phone service here so you would have to take pictures and upload later."
1981,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The Hashman checking in here. This place is good. Really good. So good I went back twice in three days. First day was the corned beef hash. If you like loads of stringy, very tasty corned beef then you'll love this hash. They layer this hash over home fried potatoes with some melted cheese on top. The second day I had the Chorizo sausage hash. A very tasty libation prepared the same way, but much more tasty with jalapeÃ±os and tex-mex seasonings. The rest of the table had the largest pancakes in the world. But also some of the best tasting with banana and lots of other selections. I really wanted the chicken fried waffles. They looked awesome. One last thing, the best biscuits anywhere. I will go back anytime I'm in Las Vegas. Oh and the Hash although not in my top five is definitely worth a try. It does not disappoint.
Hash-a-Rama score Corned Beef B, Chorizo Hash B+
 
Hashman out!"
1982,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great breakfast place at the Imperial Palace. I ordered the Sage Chicken and Waffles which is belgian waffles stuffed with bacon and topped with fried chicken and fried leeks and maple syrup. Was very excited to try this meal and it was good overall, although a little disappointing. The chicken was a little dry and I kept dousing my meal in maple syrup, but the chicken was absorbing it so it still was somewhat dry. However, it was good overall and the other people who got regular breakfast seemed to enjoy it a lot."
1983,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you're a tourist and you're looking for a typical American breakfast/brunch experience, that's definitely the place. Nearly every item on the menu is too heavy, too big or too sugary to manage to eat it all. 

But first things first, the line for the tables is EXTREMELY long. I mean like 40 minutes at least. However, you can easily keep yourself amused the whole time by reading letters from famous people who ate there and loved it very much. There's also photos and articles from magazines. After you are called, the waiter leads you into a big room full of people and gives you big printed menu. The place was extremely busy the whole time, but the staff was great and we didn't have to wait too long to order or get food.

As I said before, the choice is overwhelming. Really! There's so many options that I could sit there for an hour and I still wouldn't be completely sure what to order. So I started with watermelon kivi lemonade. It was amazing! Very sweet, big and colorful and yet refreshing. I drank two of them. And a sweet coffee. So when we left I was on sugar rush :D. For breakfast we both decided on Farm Benedict. Mine was a bit on the lighter side, with smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, potatoes and roasted red pepper cream but my fiance went crazy and chose the version with crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin, market yellow tomato, spinach, potatoes and barb' que cream. Pork tenderloin. For breakfast. He's mad. The other reviews certainly don't lie, the portions are ENORMOUS. I honestly cannot imagine a person that would eat it whole. We could share one and we probably would still left some of it. The dish itself is a big mix of everything you could possibly want for breakfast all in one, layer after layer and topped wit crazy amount of sauce. It's a strange mix of flavors. I loved it but it was so heavy I can't imagine eating something like that more often than twice a month. 

The prices weren't very high and we had a great time there, laughing, looking disbelievingly at our dishes, taking pictures. The place is always full of tourists so nobody cares. Definitely a must visit!"
1984,Hash House A Go Go,4,Corned beef hash was delicious and easily shared.  The hot chocolate was sweet with chocolate syrup drizzled all over the cup.
1985,Hash House A Go Go,4,"HUGE portions. I got the tractor meal - 2 eggs with sausage and French toast with a grilled banana on top. It was delicious and very filling. Couldn't finish it! $15

My friend got the same thing but with the brown sugar banana flap jack and it was literally the side of a medium pizza. Needless to say she ate a quarter of it. 

Overall a very satisfying place to go for some brekky in the morning. Its very busy but we only had to wait 30 min for a table. Turnover is very fast. Our waitress was very attentive and was a pro!"
1986,Hash House A Go Go,3,Just ok. The portions were huge absolutely massive. I would say if you have a massive hangover and need a mega breakfast this would be the place. It's like a diner atmosphere and very loud and noisy. Our server was nice but our food seemed to take a ridiculously long time. prices are cheap considering the amount of food.
1987,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hell yeah, can't wait to go back.  Oversized deliciousness.  Oh yes, nitro cold brew just because sometimes you need that"
1988,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great drinks and fun environment! I had the chicken and waffles which had a reputation that it 100% upheld!
1989,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I come here every time I'm in Vegas! This is my number 1 choice for breakfast on the strip...awesome menu, HUGE portions, good prices considering how much food you are getting! Quick service, and they bring out your food when it is ready, even if you are the only one at the table whose food is ready. Some folks may not like this, but I think this is an awesome touch. Just like if it was a homemade meal you get your food as soon as its ready!  No sense in waiting and letting it sit and cool off waiting for the rest of the tables food to get done."
1990,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for breakfast/ lunch. Everything was good but huge , don't go unless you have a huge appetite. Also if they ask you if you want your drink in a stiletto glass, it's literally a leg with a stiletto on.    Costs an extra 5-10 dollars depending on the drink you get."
1991,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is phenomenal!!! It is open 24/7 and definitely gets crowded during peak times (1+ hr wait). We waited over an hour to get our food, which I won't lie we were pretty agitated. When the food finally arrived I must say we thought the wait was TOTALLY worth it! The food was so amazing and the portions are extremely huge (even the oatmeal). All the food is shareable. They have tons of different cocktails, homemade lemonades, fresh squeezed juices and crazy coffee flavors. This is a must do while in Vegas. They also serve all menu items all the time."
1992,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Based on the hype and reviews, I really wanted to love this place but it was a total let down. The service was slow despite the fact that it was half empty, the restaurant itself was pretty dark and sticky, and worst of all, the food was terrible. The waffles were lukewarm and soggy. I was so disappointed."
1993,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had the The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It was amazing. I thought it might have been one of those situations when my eyes were bigger than my stomach. And I was right. However, this didn't feel heavy in my stomach. 

Would definitely recommend."
1994,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash house is always an option whenever I'm in Vegas. Portions are huge so sharing might be a good idea.

I've had the Chorizo Hash and also Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Both are delicious! 

The location at The Quad is also open 24/7."
1995,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was basically a hermit in Vegas, rarely venturing outside of my hotel, but Hash House A Go Go had come highly recommended so I ventured out into the world to find it.

Going up the escalator to Hash House, I was faced with huge crowds of people waiting for tables. The lovely benefit of eating alone is the ability to jump ahead of lines when there's space at the bar, and gratefully this was one of those occasions.

My server was super friendly, and got me set up with a tangerine mimosa and some fresh peach jam for the gigantic biscuit that came with my basil, goat cheese & sun dried tomato scramble. It also came with some potatoes and fresh fruit. The potatoes were pretty meh, but everything else was fucking delicious! I will definitely be trying to recreate my egg scramble at home, it was perfection. 

A really tasty breakfast with tons and tons of great sounding food options and really interesting drink choices, you've got to come give it a shot."
1996,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is super popular... and for good reason. Hash House served me one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles and OH MY GOODNESS -- words can not describe how delicious this meal was. The portion was huge! It is easily shareable between 2-3 people. The chicken was incredibly juicy on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. The waffles were fluffy and had real pieces of bacon inside! The customer service was equally as great. Our waitress was always checking up on us and kept our waters filled. 

The wait here can be super long, but it's totally worth it! Everyone needs to try their chicken and waffles at least once in their life -- it's THAT good."
1997,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The ultimate locale to get fattening food in Vegas (and San Diego). I got their fried chicken tower with waffles, and it was delicious! The fried chicken was huge, but juicy throughout and very well-breaded. The waffles were crisp, and the bacon inside added a good meaty taste, I was wondering why IHOP doesn't do that too. The hashes are very tasty too! The price isn't cheap, but for the portions you get, you can get two or three meals out of a plate. Expect a long wait unless you go super late at night, it's veryyy popular."
1998,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Came to this Hash House in Imperial Palace because we wanted to avoid the long wait on the one on Sahara.  

There was no line when we got there and there were plenty of seats opened, but it still took 10 minutes to seat us.  

After we ordered our food, it took 45 minutes for us to get our food.  When we got our food, it looked like our food was made a while ago and the mash potatoes started to form a cold layer on top.  

The food was still OK even though it wasn't as warm.  But after all that waiting, I lost my appetite."
1999,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place easily earns the 5 star rating from me! 

While visiting Vegas for Tough Mudder my hunny and I were absolutely famished after our 20K run through the muddy hot dessert heat. We were told that the portions here at HHAGG were HUGE and I was up for the challenge. 

The service here was up beat and cheerful without being over the top. Our server Cody was great, offering suggestions when I couldn't decide what to have. Their all day menu didn't make it easy, but after narrowing it down to a few choices Cody directed me in the right direction. Our food came out in a timely manner, hot and delicious! 

Saying the portions here are HUGE is a serious understatement. A standard meal here can feed my family of 4, no exaggeration. They don't skimp on presentation either-the food looks sooo good!! 

Noteworthy... 

-Hash House is a little hidden gem. Had we not overheard someone talking about it we probably would have known it existed in The Linq. As hotel guests that's too bad. 

-As we were settling up our server offered to refill my soda. I said just a bit as we were almost done. She offered a to go cup! While this little detail is minor to some, to me it was that little detail that stuck and made a huge impact on our experience. 

-If you're staying on the strip and don't have a way to re heat your food, share a dish! I wish I had taken an after pic of what I ate, I barely made a dent."
2000,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food is always a winner. Huge portions and very delicious. However the wait staff needs help. Our waitress took our order and then we never saw her again until she returned with our check while we were still eating. She never asked if everything was ok or if we need more water, nothing. She definitely needs more training. I would give four stars but with this utter negligence I am taking off two just for this lack of customer service."
2001,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food here is obviously the main attraction and well worth it. The portion sizes are extra large, great family place; I'd recommend always sharing a plate and then ordering more food afterwards if you're still hungry; otherwise you'll just end up wasting the food. 
Location - Hash House is located at the back of the Linq Hotel. It takes a few mins to reach and the average wait time is 20 mins. 
Staff - The staff and restaurant have excellent table turn over. They are able to quickly seat guests, but it can be down hill from there. We never saw our waiter after the food was delivered and had to waive down several another waiters. 
Food - There are amazing varieties of food and all well seasoned. We ordered bananas foster waffles pancakes, coffee, etc and everything was so favorable. The prices are reasonable for what you get. 

I would rate them a 5 if the service after the food was delivered improved."
2002,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Top pick to dine at in Vegas, gigantic portions, always been delicious every time! French toast is fav dish."
2003,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just finished breakfast at Hash House a GoGo here in beautiful Las Vegas. We're not virgins though, we have been to HHAGG in Phoenix and Chicago, and while I love all three the site in Vegas has something the other two do not... server Amanda. Amanda was fun, informative and timely. Her sense of humor and slight asides were so funny (""My wife and I will split the Texas Ranchero."" ""Oh, you got the memo..."") that I found myself smiling just seeing her roll up. The food, as always, was excellent, HUGE portions, hot and tasty. The other couple we are traveling with got the meatloaf, and boy, it was a good thing they decided to exercise portion control and split the meal, else they would have not been able to even put a serious dent it, it was so big."
2004,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place has gone downhill since I was last there. The cheese in the eggs weren't mixed. The pancake was huge (yeah) but dry (boo). The server was attentive but forgot a lot of what we asked for and we had to get someone else on 3 occasions to get items the server forgot. 
We've gone there everytime we come to Las Vegas and learned that we need to be Diamond or 7 Seas for the VIP line (just an FYI to future patrons)

We had breakfast at The Paris instead for the remainder of the week and the pancakes were so much better as was the service/food. 
I think we caught HH on an ""off day"" and we've all had them. 

Once we left Vegas, we achieved DIAMOND status."
2005,Hash House A Go Go,4,Long lines. Worth the wait. Get there early. Fantastic bloody Mary's at the bar(while you wait). Huge portions. Pancakes .... Mmmmmm...huge.  Sausage gravy and biscuits are good and enough for two. Split something unless you have a refrigerator back In your room.
2006,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ok, I saw this place on travel channel about a week ago. I was not disappointed with the food at all. Our server, Andrew was very polite and he answered all of our questions. The food was very good. And there was a lot of it. These portions should be shared.  But if cannot decide, just get the rest to go. My only complaint was that I thought the service was a little slow. However the staff from our host to the bus staff were good. And the restaurant is kept clean. The hash house a go go. Should be on your list."
2007,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Okay, I've had Hash House on my list of must try places forever!  Maybe it is just this location, but let me just say that I was not impressed.  First of all, the staff here was unattentive and borderline rude!  While we were waiting, my bf and I decided to try to get some drinks at the bar.  We checked with the hostess to make sure we could go order directly from the bar.  We waited at the bar for more than 10 minutes and were continuously ignored by the bartender.  I know she was serving people at the bar, but any sort of acknowledgment would have helped.

When we finally got seated, we had to wait quite a while for the food to come out.  It was overpriced and over-hyped bland chicken and waffles. The server never bothered to check on us.  And I had to walk over to him and ask for the bill.  He made me wait another 5 minutes before bringing it over.  I know it is in the Imperial Palace, but still...can the service get any worse?  I think they only had one server for the whole restaurant!

My friends swear by the one in SD, but I don't know...the only redeeming thing about this establishment was that my bf really liked his bloody mary drink."
2008,Hash House A Go Go,5,Portions are huge and the food is delicious. The staff is friendly. Seriously the best bang for your buck. I loved it all!!
2009,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Just got back from a trip to Vegas and this was one of our dinner spots while in town.  We reserved a table for Tuesday evening, which as it turns out wasn't necessary because the restaurant was half empty once we arrived.

Staff were friendly enough, took our drink order pretty quick and allowed us a few minutes to look over the menu.  Looked pretty standard as far as offerings went.

I opted for some fried green tomatoes to start.  They were good, but nothing to write home about.  For my entrÃ©e, I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.  So here's the thing.  Hash House is known for their portions...and that's a fair assessment, because this thing was huge!  I'm a big eater, and I couldn't finish it.  It was creamy, full of chicken and huge chunks of vegetables, it tasted pretty good.  The crust however, was a huge miss for me, which is a shame because I love a flaky crust and this was not that.

Wife got chicken & waffles which she said were delicious. Friends ordered a burger and the meatloaf, both of which were ""good"", but I couldn't tell anything beyond that.

Now, in typical Vegas fashion, this place is a little pricey.  I personally think you are paying partly for the ability to say you ate there.  It was good don't get me wrong, I just don't think the hype lived up to the price."
2010,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We had a terrible experience at the Hash house. Be prepared for long waiting times. We ordered the rosemary chicken strips for appetizers. That took around 20 minutes to arrive and the taste was very ordinary. The chipotle sauce with it wasn't going well with it so we used hot sauce. 

Our lemon chicken which was the main course suggested by our waiter took around 40 minutes to arrive. And that again was bland. The vegetables were not seasoned and we were adding salt and pepper to try and eat at least a little bit of it. 

To flush down our misery we ordered some peppermint tea. That took another 20 minutes to arrive. That was the only good part of our lunch. Overall a really bad experience. Not sure why there's so much hype about this place around Vegas."
2011,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Not sure what all the hype is about. I ate here a couple times while I was in Vegas and found the food to be just ""okay"". The only thing going for them is the massive portions."
2012,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Great food,  very large fresh servings.  Katie pur waitress was so friendly and nice. She checked back many times and our drinks were always kept full. 

The Hostess was not at all nice. After trying to seat us by the kitchen and then at a table we asked for a booth. We were told that it was shift change so we couldn't have a booth WTF?  Before our water came to our table same hostess was sitting others in the booths. Her attitude was rude"
2013,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love there food at Hash House. I've been to the location on Sahara and loved the atmosphere there over this location. As a Las Vegas Local I'll stick to the one off the strip. Over all the food was the same, LARGE portions and reasonable pricing. A great way to start your day and easily shared with your husband."
2014,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food looks better than it tastes.  Not to say it was bad, it just was ok.  I got the sage fried chicken breakfast and a bloody mary, and as many have said here, the chicken could use some seasoning as it was pretty bland.  The drinks were better than the food, I have to say.

I'm not big on gigantic novelty meals that I won't finish, I'd rather the food taste great.  That all said, it's still a solid breakfast choice."
2015,Hash House A Go Go,4,Epic proportions. Ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash benedicts... the portions are humongous. You could feed a family of 4 with this. Bacon wrapped fried chicken with delicious gravy on biscuits.
2016,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food is always great when I eat here. I had the Lemon Herb chicken in the HH Favorites section. The veggies were cooked to perfection. My favorite was the string beans. The chicken was baked and tastes like your average baked chicken but was still delicious. But the sauce!!! The sauce was the real star, so good that I ordered a 2nd order of it just to take home and put on other stuff. It was very strong with lemon flavor but made me fall in love. I changed my mashed potatoes to the loaded cheese and bacon mashed potatoes and I will never regret that choice ever in life lol.

The biscuits they brought to the table before our meal had a nice honey butter glaze on top and was pretty good but needed more honey just to coat all layers of the biscuit because they were so HUGE!! 

The drinks are the reason I only gave HH a 4/5 star rating. I had a lime margarita but it was extremely sweet, it appeared to be in a red wine glass and it had a nerve to be $9! All of the other drinks were 14.99 and didn't really look like it would fit my bill of what I wanted.

Overall, it was a good dinner and the plus side is it's 24/7! Have fun!"
2017,Hash House A Go Go,4,"What can you say different about a place that had 4K reviews ?
Hash House a Go Go has been around a long time and is a must while in Las Vegas. 
We waited in line for approximately 40 minutes. Lots of neat articles to read along with pictures/autographs while you wait.
Very friendly waiter! He was patient with us as we ordered and asked him about 20 questions!!
Our table ordered four different things. 
We had the chicken and waffles, vanilla waffle with eggs and bacon, pancake and French toast.
We even ordered biscuits! Why ? We had to take them with us, we were full !
The serving sizes are Huge!!  I don't think a single person ate everything on their plate. 
For a brunch in Las Vegas, the meals were very reasonably priced.
Go get Full"
2018,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I ordered a huge monstrosity kindly referred to as the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. My husband ordered a warm spinach salad. I ordered that $18 monster because it seemed like everyone in the restaurant was ordering it. It is egg, sage fried chicken, and biscuits all laying on a bed of mashed potatoes and covered in a special sauce and cheese with a sprig of sage as garnish. While it is big, this is such a bland dish, hardly any flavor at all throughout. Also, the decoration using dry spaghetti noodles is useless. Please stop. It cheapens the dishes and pokes the roof of the mouth if not removed promptly. My husband's warm spinach salad was small for the price (especially compared to what I ordered!) and had too much onions. I must say good wait staff though. They were in the middle of a shift change and still didn't miss a beat. Eat off the strip for the good stuff."
2019,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Atmosphere is loud and fun. Menu is amazing.  Portions are huge..... Wait was loooooong to get seated (45 minutes).  Kitchen time was about half an hour from order time.....  Though our party wasn't expecting a quick bite, we also did not expect to devote three hours to breakfast on a Saturday morning....  And the line was even longer when we left!"
2020,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Giant portions is an understatement. Come hungry! We went around 7am and got a table quickly. Started to get packed at 8am. Server was really polite and available. Restaurant appeared clean. Food came out relatively quickly. 

I ordered the tractor driver combo with griddled French toast. It was so delicious. The candied pecans and banana are a great touch. 

Husband ordered the bacon waffle. There are strips of bacon cooked in to the waffle!! This was awesome as well. 

Definitely a place to try while in Vegas."
2021,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So my husband came here a few weeks ago (for the first time) and after that I heard ""We have to go there next time we're in Vegas! It's great food and very decently priced. Huge portions, great biscuits!"" I had to listen to this for weeks, so I was relieved when we finally got to go! I thought ""seriously how great can one breakfast place be?"" Well let me tell you.....

We went this last Saturday morning and it was packed. I mean like flies swarming to food packed. Super packed. We were given a 1 hr 15 min wait. We were ok with that. I mean that's a great indication that people love the place right??

We went downstairs to get a few coffees and after 30 mins I asked my husband to check on the wait time. To our surprise, they were ready for us! I never have bloody marys but hubby said this place is known for their bloody marys, so I thought why the heck not! I looked at the menu - man oh man do they have a selection of bloody marys. I had no clue what to get so I kept it simple to the house version. Let me tell you- this was my very first bloody mary and it was brilliant!!! It was soooo good!!! I shared it with my cousin who is an avid bloody mary fan and he said he loved it. They infuse the pickle and olives with something...I can't put my figure on it, but it's darn tasty!!! 

Hubby and I split the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It's actually enough food for 3 people!!! It's a complete meal. I took a picture of the description of the benedict so I wouldn't forget what yummy goodness was in there. Eggs, fresh crisp tomato, spinach, fried chicken,  biscuits, huge strips of bacon, touch of hot sauce on the side....I know I'm forgetting something. It was quite literally the most complete meal I've ever had for breakfast. Soooo good!!! Now I'm going to be dreaming about this. It's definitely a once in a while splurge because you can easily rename it to ""the heart attack "" meal.  LoL 

We also had the corn beef hash (which was also enough for 2 people). Best corn beef hash ever!!! The potatoes = delicious!!! We also also had the French toast which was excellent. We like our French toast a bit on the crispy side, so it could have been more crispy. 

Great food. Lots of food! Huge portions. Wait I mean HUGE portions!!!  You have to try it!! Next time I will be trying their world famous chicken and waffles. If I had another day in Vegas, that's where I would be!!!"
2022,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is great. Went to the one in downtown Vegas in the wee morning!! I felt boring and only ordered the basic breakfast. Didn't want anything too heavy at this hour. The basic consisted of two eggs cooked to your liking, choice of meats and I choose bacon and potatoes and you're choice of bread I got the biscuit bc they didn't have sour dough my fave. The potatoes were perfect. Had caramelized onions that were finely chopped and mixed into the potatoes. Great flavors. My fiancÃ© ordered the big tractor breakfast!! The pancakes were the size of these gigantic plates they were on. Those were so yummy. Next time when I get a chance to come here again I won't be boring and I would like to order their pork tenderloin or sage fried chicken sandwich or waffles. Great selection of comfort foods here. As I looked at each plate coming out from the kitchen to the customers the presentations were amazing. You see first with your eyes so you salivate even before taking that first bite. I will be back again for sure!"
2023,Hash House A Go Go,5,The portion sizes and the food was amazing!!!!  I love this place.
2024,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing amazing amazing...needed a great meal at 230am....the apple cinnamon banana pancake....holy wow!!!!.great service and ammmmazing food. Blue cheese hamburger amazing as well.
2025,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Large portions!!! Fair price.  Average food.  Nothing special .  Was super excited to try this place but was disappointed.  Probably wouldn't return.  Ordered sage chicken w eggs and potatoes. Chicken was super dry,  potatoes were flavorless,  and the biscuit was ok.  Blueberry pancake was LARGE!!! But nothing special in regards to flavor or taste:(. Just really big.  Corned beef hash was pretty good !  Staff was friendly."
2026,Hash House A Go Go,5,Talk about BIG PORTIONS with a diner feel.  I have been to two different Hash House A Go Go in Las Vegas and they were both very good.  This particular location is right on the strip so we did have to wait for a table for about 30 minutes or more.  We went into the casino and did a little shopping and came back and we was seated immediately.  We had breakfast each time we came and couldn't finish any of our food on our plates.  We left with big bellies and smiles on our faces.
2027,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had this place bookmarked for what seems like forever. Finally made it. the wait time was 30-45 minutes & the line was deep (this was at on off peak traditionally speaking time of day). Then we heard sweet music to our ears. Over the loud speaker an angel said ""there is seating available immediately at bar"". Well not only did we not know there was a bar let alone seating. So we hauled ass over there & were in & out in less than 60 minutes. We shared as the portions are Ginormous. We saw lots of people with to go boxes but those are cumbersome unless you're staying at the hotel. We had the BLT Bloody Mary with pepper infused vodka (so good), house Mimosa (good) & hash with corned beef (also very good). A little on the cooler side to my liking for a plate of pots & hash but what are you gonna do? The BLT Bloody Mary was enough to die for & so cute. It was served with a BLT. As in like actually a BLT. 2 pieces of bacon, toast (hard toasted, dip it in drink) & lettuce on it. Can't wait to go back & try the Rosemary Fried Chicken & Waffles. Yup, that sh** had my name all over it. Hubs not a fan of the chicken & waffle. But I still gotta love him! I'll just have to beg him to suck it up."
2028,Hash House A Go Go,4,Omg these portions are huge! I'd recommend sharing something!! I got the fried chicken - it came with a mound of bacon mashed potatoes and a huge biscuit. The chicken and biscuit were delicious! Could've lived without the potatoes and certainly didn't have room for them. They have a ton of drinks - I had the Bloody Mary BLT and Aloha Royale. Both good. I wish the blt was slider style - would've been much easier to eat! Bonus for BLTs - you can pick your vodka (price was $18 for one with ketel one).
2029,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here after a long night of gambling with my new husband. Place was pretty busy but we were seated right away. Our server was super sweet, and very helpful with recomendations. I ordered the corned beef sandwich, fries, and the BLT bloody mary. The portion sizes here are massive so prepare to take lots of leftovers. My sandwich was ok, and the fries we're nice and hot, but my bloody mary was out of this world. I bought it in the hash house a go go glass as a keepsake. You can seriously make a sandwich with all of the BLT ingredients that are toothpicked to the side of the drink. Bacon, lettuce, tomato, and even bread. The drink itself was prefectly made and was nice and spicy, just the way I like it. Will be back for the drinks if nothing else."
2030,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas and I've never had a bad meal or poor service here. It's worth the 20 min wait and I can't wait to come back. I had Sage Chicken and Eggs and it was a HUGE meal that was delicious. My husband had the Chorizo Egg Skillet and it was really good... I could smell the spice from across the table. Our waiter was attentive and a happy person who made our meal that much better. I can't wait to come back next time we're in Vegas.
2031,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I would have given Hash House A Go Go five stars if we hadn't returned for dinner. The brunch we had was amazing! We shared the chicken and waffles, it was enough for more than the two of us. The chicken was perfectly cooked, with a great crispy shell and juicy breast meat. The waffles were light and had just enough crust. The dish was presented beautifully and the service was just great. We enjoyed it so much we returned for dinner the next night.

Dinner just didn't impress. The place felt more like a sleepy diner than the great meeting spot that if felt like earlier in the day. My husband had the Chicken Pot Pie special, it was good... That's all I can say. I had a boring salad and a rib appetizer, both were okay. Mostly it was such a different atmosphere that it left us feeling kinda melancholy afterward."
2032,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I don't think any human could, or should finish the amount of food they serve here. 

Came here at 7:30 the morning of the first games of the NCAA tournament, and there was already a 30 minute wait. A little snooping and we grabbed three seats at the bar. 

The Bloody Mary's here are top notch; tons of spice and pickled vegetables, including an olive stuffed with a jalapeÃ±o that cleared my sinuses for sure. A friend also had their unique take on a screwdriver made from tangerine juice and honey vodka. If you like a screwdriver, you must give this a go instead. Amazing mix of flavors in a totally unexpected way. 

I opted for the sage fried chicken, which came with scrambled eggs, about two pounds of mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. I'm not kidding when I say this was probably 4 pounds of food. The fried chicken is the obvious star of the dish, and was crispy and pretty sure had some cornflakes in there, topped with a savory syrup sauce. 

This is one of the true value meals on the strip, with the food coming in around $14ish for more food than a human should reasonable eat in a single sitting. Expect a wait here, and don't worry, the food and drink make it more than worthwhile. You don't want to miss out on this one."
2033,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place! A group of us went to Vegas this weekend and were looking for good quality food, reasonable pricing and good drinks!! we walked through the whole strip and my boyfriend found them on yelp and we thought we'd give it a shot. This places menu is mind blowing! (similar to 50/50 slaters in pasadena, CA.) I used to live in vegas and this spot was never there.. so thankful to discover this treasure. from now on, on all my Vegas trips I will be coming here. Their also open 24hrs!! prices are very cheap and very large portions. I ordered the sausage w/ gravy biscuits, mashed potato and fruit plate mmmm... so good! everything everybody else ordered I tasted and was excellent as well. Presentation is a 10!!! both thumbs up!"
2034,Hash House A Go Go,3,"located upstairs in the IP on the strip.. ive been twice and twice the service was awesome.
foodwise... meh, pretty bland. the breakfast was great but who can mess up eggs?
chicken potpie was really dry. it was mixed with mash potatoe, chicken, and potato pieces.., tomato and spinach leaves. it was like they just threw everything in the potpie. 
large portions! and the bisquits they give in the beginning were super yummy. i could have made a meal out of that...
and personally, the chicken and waffles look like a hotmess. it looks so ugly i dont want to try it,"
2035,Hash House A Go Go,5,We love this place!! Had the tractor combo with the brown sugar banana pancake! My husband and I shared and there was still so much left over! Don't let the wait scare you it's worth it and goes by fast!
2036,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good Food. What a great place to go in Las Vegas after staying up late drinking, gambling and just having a good time. 

The portions were huge, the flavors were good, the bloody mary from the front desk was very helpful (although getting one took so long. The guy had to go in the back and 25 minutes came back with ours. He could have sold 5 times more if he could just take orders and have the bar deliver the drinks quickly. It was just the oddest thing. Seems like the restaurant/bar cound have made so much more money if they would have figured it out."
2037,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of the best reasons to stay at the Quad in Las Vegas because this place is open 24 HOURS!! 

My group ordered everything to go so we could take it up to our room. The waitress at the bar was super friendly and made sure we had everything we needed so we didn't have to come back for utensils or anything. 

I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict ($17 with tax) which is a favorite of Adam Richman from Man vs. Food. 

This round, FOOD WINS. Why, you ask? 

It's ginormous. 
Thanksgiving gave a stamp of approval on the mashed potatoes.
Jesus likes their biscuits.
The South would be very happy with this fried chicken. 
This most interesting man on Earth picked the tomatoes and spinach from the freshest farms.
Gordan Ramsay would claim the benedict sauce as ""Duh-licious. Absolutely incredible.""
CHEESE

This was the only meal I had all day and I still couldn't finish it! Plus, it's perfect to help you keep a high tolerance to alcohol. So again..mashed potatoes, biscuits, fried chicken, tomatoes, spinach, cheese and ALL OF THIS SMOTHERED IN BENEDICT SAUCE. 

Best breakfast dish I have ever had. Hands down. I will now build a shrine to this dish."
2038,Hash House A Go Go,4,"At the end of a meal with family or friends, I'm the guy who is still eating and finishing people's leftovers but I could not finish the Sage fried chicken benedict meal. The chicken was great, juicy and crispy even with the cheese and benedict sauce drenched over it. The mashed potatoes and biscuit on the bottom were good too but too much for me. I could not finish them (Sorry America for letting you down). 

If I'm in Vegas again, I will definitely be coming back and rechallenging their huge plates!"
2039,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I read the other reviews about the wait being intense, but i assume thats only for breakfast and not dinner, because for dinner there was no line at all. Anyways...

Looking at the menu, everything sounds so good, So i got what i craved, Chicken and Waffles. 

Honestly, the portions are tooo much. I couldn't eat it all, but it was pretty good. The way they fried the chicken was different, maybe better than roscoes chicken? DAMNNN. The waffle was strange. It had bacon in it which sounds delish, but it just tasted like the waffle wasn't fully cooked or something.

My friends loved their burgers and Benedict's they ordered.

This is one place I need to come back to for breakfast next time."
2040,Hash House A Go Go,3,"You know when all your friends and their friends' friends have been to a cool joint and you're the only one that's never been? Well such as the case with Hash House A Go Go. My ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. 

Then they said Adam Richman from Man V Food went there. Say no more. We are going to Hash House A Go Go.

My friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. Well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. 

The menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam's favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend's Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. 

The portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were ""normal"" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken. Even that dish I expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. Sometimes it's better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. 

*I was really angry that they don't have any restrooms in the restaurant. I had to run downstairs back into the casino."
2041,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I love Hash House but this location is inside the Imperial Palace which literally made me want to shoot myself. Parking is a pain in the ass, and walking through the disgusting casino is a chore in itself.

This location is open until 11 during the week unlike 9 for the Sahara location which is why I went here. The menu is exactly the same yet the kitchen was a bit slow considering there were less than 10 tables in the restaurant. At least our server was nice! I know I'll be eating my meal for the next 3 days as well. Get the BBQ ribs, they are amazing!"
2042,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was good and the prices were fair. A little hard to find but worth the effort. All their orders look great . I went with my large family of 14 people and each plate looked great and everyone enjoyed.
2043,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They told us our wait would be 30 minutes, but it was more like 10! yay!

Our waiter was great. I ordered a scramble that had sausage, jalapenos, potatoes, and what I can only describe as chili-like. It was good. Needed more sausage, less potatoes. I also ordered a brown sugar banana flapjack. Big ol' 14"" thing. Too ambitious on my part. We only ate maybe a 1/3 of it. It was good though. Bf ordered the Tractor Driver combo with french toast. It came with bananas that were cut length-wise and still had the peel on them. Interesting presentation. 

I noticed all the plates around us were served with fruit. Refreshing. Though their portions are huge! So that takes away that healthy factor. oh well!"
2044,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was so delicious! I can understand what all the hype was all about. Us three girls ordered 2 dishes and almost didn't finish. Portions are generous!
2045,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is great service and terrific food for the money. In Las Vegas you can spend a whole lot more for a whole lot less. Friendly people serving great comfort food. Try it and you'll be back.
2046,Hash House A Go Go,1,I got the Benedict meal as seen on man vs food. It was not good! The food was a huge pile of bland. I also got a BLT bloody Mary. I like to think of myself as a bloody Mary enthusiast. I t one literally everywhere I go. This one was terrible. Bland w no spice. I saw hash a go go on the travel channel today. They showed the exact same for I had. There was no bacon or seasoning anywhere on in or around my drink. There was no packet of mayo either. I had a watered down tomato drink. This was the worst place I ate in my 7 days in Vegas.
2047,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I get that this place is busy packed all the time, but maybe that just means they need to bring on more staff to help. 

Went in with some friends and we all ordered mimosas and food. after waiting about 25 min for our mimosa  both the drink runner and food runner showed up at our table at the same time. The food was great, but our mimosas were warm! There's nothing like sipping on warm orange juice with a splash of champaign. 

Out server never came back to check on us, we went without napkins, water, and syrup for the French toast. When our server came back it was just to drop off our bill. 

Needless to say I won't be back! Wasn't worth it at all!!"
2048,Hash House A Go Go,4,Get there early. If there's a wait grab a Bloody Mary or mimosas from the bar. Be sure to get the fried chicken and waffles with saffron. The portions are huge.
2049,Hash House A Go Go,5,Never a disappointment. Portions are HUGE! Brunch is delish! I've been to the Orlando and Vegas location and both are superb. Highly recommend for those with an enormous appetite.
2050,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Pros - French toast, eggs, and bacon.
Con: Waiting 35 min for French toast, eggs, and bacon."
2051,Hash House A Go Go,3,Food was good. Service was the worst I've ever had. First time in my life I've ever left less than 20% for a tip.  My wife and I went an hour without refills to coffee and water. Food took over 35 minutes. 1 hour wait to get in. Not impressed at all.
2052,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Sugar and grease, be ready! If that is what you like...
Worst Sangria ever, pure sugar, no taste whatsoever.
BBQ chicken sandwich drenched in super sweet sauce, can't tell of the taste.
Really really bad BBQ joint."
2053,Hash House A Go Go,3,I had high hopes for this place after finding out it was featured on man vs food. I couldn't decide on what to order. There's so much to chose from. I felt like I needed to try a waffle and my hubby tried the fried chicken. The food was mediocre. There was no flavor at all in the fried chicken. The crust part was just plain. The waffle was good but not the best. The biscuit that came with the chicken was fluffy and buttery. The servings were big. A few of our friends got the chicken and waffles and a pancake with banana and brown sugar. The pancake was probably the best dish. It didn't need syrup and it was huge! Our server was so funny! He made our meal enjoyable. It was worth the try but I don't think I'll be back again.
2054,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Sorry in advance for the ridiculously long post...
Im not sure where to start... the mediocre food or the mediocre service. We stopped by on a Sunday night with a reasonably large group (10). Since we wanted to see the Bellagio Show before is ends at 12AM we stopped by Hash House to check on the wait. We were told there was no wait and in fact they were slow. We asked to put our name down for a reservation and were told they dont take reservations (ok). We cam back round 11 and were promptly told it would be 20-25 minutes. We were not please but decided to wait because we where here and staying close by and all wanted toi tyr the food. After a 10 minute wait the greater came and told us it was going to be at least another 25 minutes because they only had one large table available and that table just received their food. Annoying, I should have taken this as a sign, but the majority of the group was fine although a little annoyed. One friend decided to walk around and saw that they were in fact very slow (almost no tables occupied) and also had a back room with a large table available. He asked the receptionist if they could put tables together since almost the whole restaurant was empty or let us sit in the back. All we receive was a ""no, we cant do that"". Cant or Wont? Still we waited on. 15 more minutes pass and surprise they open the table in the back section. So I guess they could do it. Finally we are all sitting down starving and ready to go in on some delicious food... Or were we. We placed our orders based on their ""late night menu"", which is lack luster at best (about 10 items). The waiter came round and although he was polite seems a little slow based on how unbusy they were. Heres were it went south quickly. I ordered the Sage Chicken Benedict and asked for the eggs poached, cause who the hell scrambles eggs and calls it eggs Benedict?! The wait for the food again seemed long for how slow the place was, 20 minutes, but for good food I would gladly wait. First thing I noticed when they bring my food is eggs are not poached. I ask the waiter to fix it and he graciously takes my plate back. 10-15 minutes pass my whole party is eating (although one guy got his food alarmingly later then everyone else). The waiter brings back my plate and it looks disheveled and clearly reconstructed. I look at it and touch it to see if they remade the plate or just switched out the eggs. The waiter quickly snaps at me ""I had them remake the whole plate"" to which I reply ""I highly doubt that, because its not hot."" The icing on the cake and what made it so blatant that the food was not remade was my poached eggs were not even on the dish... they came on the side in a sad lonely little bowl. They remade the whole plate... really? There was no apology no admission he just carried on as usual. We received the check (tip already included because of the size of our group) and he went on about his business with out offering anything to compensate for the poor service and blatant lie. His name was David BTW, I was so pissed off I made sure to look it up so I could mention him, by name, in this review. The final nail in the Hash House coffin, the food aint that good. Its OK at best. Its over sized and over sauced and the taste is underwhelming. Its like they put extra portions of mediocre food on a plate cover it on bacon, mashed potatoes and sauce and call it spectacular. I know good food and this is no where close. Not a single person at the table seemed to be impressed, only one person even took left overs. The most impressive thing about the food at this restaurant other then the portion size was the huge branch of sage sticking out of their plate. That was pretty awe inspiring. Total restaurant fail."
2055,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place deserves 5 stars even after we waited an hour to be seated and over 30 minutes for our food. Turns out the food inspectors were there, and slowed down the kitchen. Totally worth every minute of the wait. I had the BLT Bloody Mary. Awesome. Next I had the meatloaf hash. Awesome again.  I'll be back for sure."
2056,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My friends and I were having a really bad day. We did what girls best when we're upset, and that's eat... A LOT. For appetizers we ordered some kind of fried shrimp starter (forgot what it was called), which was really good. We also ordered a crab cake pasta salad. It was AMAZING! Our waitress described it as one of her favorites, and we were sold once she said it was a  jumbo crab cake made up of over 90% crab. The crab was lump and delicious, and the pasta salad complimented it really well. The four of us split two fried chicken benedicts, which were also quite delicious, over-indulgent, and satisfying! Our server was so attentive and helpful. I feel bad for not remembering her name though.. She definitely added to the experience. We even wrote her a note on the check telling her that she made our horrible day much better :)"
2057,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Well, we finally made it back for our 3rd visit... 

This visit was worse :( 

While we waited, I ordered a cocktail from the bar... a Bloody Mary, and it was good. 

After waiting 45 minutes for a table, we were highly disappointed in our food.  

I snagged a piece of meat hanging out of my hubby's burger, and while it looked good, the meat was super bland!!  Like no salt or seasoning at all.  My breakfast potatoes needed salt, and the skillet dish had more veggies than meat... AND their famous sage chicken was tasteless!  Sadly, everything required salt.  

Adding insult to injury...  our server asked me if I ""wanted the gravy on top or on the side?""  I chose on the side because I usually prefer jam/ jelly on my biscuit, but thought I'd at least taste it this time.  I ended up not liking it on my biscuit.  Imagine my surprise when our bill had a $4.50 charge for a side of gravy!!  That's called a sneaky upcharge to pad her tip...  like, seriously!  Don't offer it to me as if it's a standard part of the meal.  Just keep it real. 

Deceitful service is worse than bad food.  They can fix the food problem, but a character problem is likely permanent.  

Won't be back."
2058,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great breakfast and brunch grub; portions are huge and it can be a bit on the pricey side. Definitely worth it if you're in a splurging mood.
2059,Hash House A Go Go,3,The food look very pretty but it lack flavor.  They give large portions.  It's was really crowded and loud.  The wait was more than 1 hour so I really was disappointed when I received the chicken and waffles.  Bland!!! I sent it back for cheeseburger still bland but tasted better.  My friend had the breakfast plate.  She said it was good.  I will not return because I like flavorful food.
2060,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This spot is a must go to when visiting Las Vegas. Our wait time was estimated at 30 minutes, but we got in within 5. It did get really busy after we arrived. I ordered the Sage's fried chicken. For $13 I got a health piece of fried chicken, 2 strips of bacon, mashed potatoes, tomatoes, fruit, and a biscuit. Could finish it all and next time would consider sharing with someone else. It took quite a bit to get our food out, but the waiter was super friendly refilling out coffee and water and the food was on point. Can't wait to come back next year!"
2061,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Come really hungry! This place has great food and huuuge portions! If you plan on getting andy's sage fried chicken benedict, I suggest that you split it with a friend or two. Do not attempt to finish it by yourself...that thing is massive! It's pretty good too and the chipotle cream sauce gives it a little bit of a kick. My fiance and I shared this and we still had letfovers! At $17.99 I think it's very reasonable since it can easily feed 3 people. 

Tried the chocolate waffle with vanilla ice cream, it was okay..nothing really special and I wished we skipped it. Not really worth 10 bucks, imo. 

Their watermelon kiwi lemonade was too sour for me but the fiance loved it. Get it spiked!

Service was a little spotty. It seemed like our server was a bit dazed..or maybe he was sleepy already. We asked him 3 times for another glass of water but he just kept on refilling the one glass we had on the table. Lol. 

We were there around 1130 pm and there was no wait at all!"
2062,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So it's mother's day and we are deciding on where to eat brunch in Las Vegas.  Always wanted to try hash house and glad we did.  Wait was kind of long but hey it's mother's day, relax.  Fast forward to our food, my wife and I split the chicken and waffles plate..... Holy crap, everything about the meal was perfect.  Definitely enough to share for two.  My brother got the bacon waffle meal, mom and pop got the healthy start breakfast.  Everyone was happy especially my wife, she was sipping on mimosas!  Sure service was slow but hey what do you expect.  They did the best they could with the crowds on hand.  Good job hhgg crew, I'm coming back for sure."
2063,Hash House A Go Go,3,"They charge my friend $5 extra for gravy but didn't tell her it was a thicker white male waiter, it felt like he did it as a 'fuck you for being a picky customer' type of move  but other then that the food is very good and satisfying 
I have breakfast lunch and dinner all for the price of one 8)"
2064,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They weren't kidding about the portion sizes being large and shareable.  I ordered a scramble which came with a biscuit and potatoes.  It was delicious.  The eggs were made well and the ham and cheese were just the perfect amount for the scramble.  

The biscuit was delicious too.  I didn't even need the jam or sausage gravy that you can order for it.  The biscuit was the size of my fist and then some so I couldn't finish it.  I did box it up and take it with me for later though.  Would definitely come here again."
2065,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Food and service was 4 stars...the location, noise level and obnoxious patrons made me want to leave immediately as we were seated, 1 star for that!

We came in Thursday morning around 1030 am, had a 30 minute wait, no problem...as we wandered around the casino, we saw 2 different people complaining to security about their wallets being stolen, ugh, bad sign.

Our seat was in the back room, at the far corner which was better than most of the seats. However, when I sat down, I couldn't even hear my BF across the table. There were several large parties eating, screaming and throwing napkins into the air while standing. I don't mind people having a good time but usually things quiet down when the food comes...what does bother me is that this is a family place and lots of small children eating. The large groups were cussing loudly and not respecting the other patrons space, this is a problem.

The server was a dream and told us that the clientele there can be brutal. You've been warned...the food is great but I wouldn't go back to this location."
2066,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were recommended to try this place by a friend who goes to Vegas often. We have never tried this place before so we decided to come here early (I'm glad we came here early because there were so many people waiting by the time we left it was hard to squeeze ourselves out of there). The restaurant is located at the Linq hotel on the second floor (when we went they were doing construction so we couldn't find the entrance without asking someone where it was first). The wait was only about 7 minutes and when we sat down we were greeted by our server right away. He was super attentive and really nice and our food and drinks came out in no time.

I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my boyfriend ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle Tower. Both meals were huge! We could of probably shared one! We dug in, and it was delicious. The crab was sweet and I like the fact they didn't scrimp on the amount of meat they gave you. The biscuits were soft and fluffy, but I couldn't eat it all because there was just so much food! I don't think I took more than two bites out of the mound of mashed potatoes under everything. My boyfriend ate all of his though (@ _@). I gave this place four stars because the food was overwhelming and even though I did enjoy my crab cakes, there was just so much of it! And the flavors of all that grease and fat were starting to really take its toll on me, internally.

After eating we kind of sat around for a bit and that's when I started to notice the smell of grease in the air. It was actually making me a tad sick after eating all of that food. As soon as we walked away though, the feeling I had in my stomach was gone and I was good.

I would probably go back and try other things though that are on the ""lighter side"". But this would not be the place to go if I had a hangover!"
2067,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Delicious food and very large portions! There are some incredibly unique items on food and drink menu which makes one want to come back several times to check them out. Do not go there if in a hurry as the place is super busy.  The service was friendly but slow which if you know in advance then it is no big deal.  We showed up at 0750 on a Sunday and still had to wait about 15 min for a seat, it's just a popular, busy place.  All in all a great experience."
2068,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I am a definite foodie. This is one of the best places I have been to for brunch. The Chorizo hash is some of the best Choriozo I have ever tasted the fact that there is jalapenos cooked into the hash and they serve it with potatoes and just a side note that you can request a tortilla in place of the biscuits. The drink with the watermelon is delicious as well as the drink that is like a mimosa but better. 

The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating versus a 5 star rating is because we had a 2 1/2 hour wait. while they were letting other groups in we continued to wait."
2069,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One star removed for an hour wait. I would give this place 99.9999% if I could. The food was out of this world. Drinks strong and different. Friendly waiter. My friends and I shared the chicken and waffles, which had BACON baked into the waffles. I also had the BLT Bloody Mary which was no joke. Definitely an appetizer as described on the menu. Also, points for the bartender who gave me a plastic cup to carry out my unfinished drink. Go here but expect a wait."
2070,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place and wanted to try it. We didn't get to try it last time we were in Vegas, so we decided to try it this time since we had a group of 5 of us!

LOCATION: Inside The LINQ! Walk towards the ""Restaurants"" and you'll take an escalator up to the front of the restaurant.

FOOD: Portions? HUGE. One plate can feed like 3-4 people (for a decent sized meal).

For the 5 of us, we ordered 2 dishes (keep in mind this was a late dinner after trekking around at the Grand Canyon the whole day). Strolled in about 9:30pm and was seated immediately. Server and hostess both warned us that portions are unlike any other place - they are GIGANTIC.

We took their advice to heart and ordered 2 dishes since none of us were starving. After much deliberation on the menu (there are so many choices), we ended up with:

- Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles
- Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict

Both were AMAZING!! All 5 of us were extremely full after those two dishes (so go figure when you order something when you come here). 

P.S. Their desserts are ginormous too!!"
2071,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was a great find inside the Hotel, large portions great choices.  There was a choice on the menu that was called something about a nascar fan breakfast.  It was a plate of bacon and 24oz Budweiser.  That was just great..."
2072,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This time was a little better. The wait wasn't too bad on the Sunday morning we went, about 30 minutes. The service was good. The food came out pretty slow but it's expected because this place was packed. All of our dishes were delicious. My beau had the usual, chicken and waffles and this time I had the Healthy Start scramble with mushroom, spinach and salmon, which came with a pretty big bowl of fruit (bananas, berries, melon, oranges). Our server noticed that I had lost my voice from all the shenanigans from the weekend and half way through our meal, he brought me a cup of hot water with lemon and honey!"
2073,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a great spot for breakfast/brunch, or at anytime you come they serve breakfast! There is hardly any wait, the restaurant is very big. There menu is a little overwhelming but our helpful waiter, Ken, had no problem explaining what everything was. I had the basic breakfast, the portions are huge! You could share entrees with your party if you'd like. If you're ever in Vegas, this is a great spot for your morning after hangover!"
2074,Hash House A Go Go,4,"To repeat what others said below, the portions are HUGE. Two people could easily split just one order. 

I had the Eggs Benedict with the fried chicken, that was shown on Man vs. Food. It was amazing. First of all, it was huge. It had a large piece of delicious fried chicken on top of eggs, biscuits and mashed potatoes. It was all topped off with a gravy that had some zip to it. The biscuits were obviously home-made and absolutely light and fluffy. The gravy was a perfect compliment instead of traditional hollandaise.

My companion had the egg skillet with Chorizo sausage and got a tortilla in lieu of a biscuit. Right choice. It was a great meal - wrapping up eggs, chorizo and potatoes in a home-made tortilla. Again, very delicious.

My companion also had a BLT bloody mary....which is a bloody mary with bacon, tomato, lettuce and a slice of toast coming out of it. It was tasty, but probably not worth the price. May just want to stick with a traditional bloody mary.

Wait was 25 minutes when we arrived around 11am on a Friday. We sat at the bar so we didn't have a wait, but it appeared they turned tables pretty quickly. Staff was very friendly and helpful, making recommendations and suggestions.

Menu was extensive and offered a lot of options, with some very interesting and clever combinations of foods. I wanted about 10 different things off the menu.

I can't comment on the poor reviews, especially for lunch/dinner items, but I think the breakfast is out of this world."
2075,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We waited 90 minutes and 60 minutes for our food. They somehow lost our ticket. So- if your food is taking awhile check in to see if your ticket is even there.

2 stars for bloody mary's and portions."
2076,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I made my friends go here when we were in Vegas because I just had to try the fried chicken! Geez. I wish they had one of these in the Bay Area. I would probably go here every week! Or maybe month since it's a little pricey... Anyhow.. sage fried chicken? DELICIOUS!
Their menu is so interesting and unique. You can't just have one item. I. need. to. go. back. no."
2077,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I don't even know where to begin! We came here because my cousin was craving pancakes. We walked across the street from Caesar's Palace. It took a while to find but just follow the brick road inside of the LINQ and it will lead you to it. My cousin ordered a single buttermilk flapjack which comes with eggs and a choice of bacon, sausage, ham or potatoes. The flapjack is 12"" round, by the way. I ordered the sage chicken and waffles. We also both ordered the small fresh squeezed orange juices. Apparently the larges ($7) are the same size as the water glasses. We did not expect what we received. 

The orange juice was delicious. I am a stickler about my fresh squeezed OJ so I was pleased. The food came out super fast! The pancake was HUGE. I mean it was truly huge. The chicken and waffles was also huge. 4 Belgian waffles with 2 big pieces of chicken. The waffles had BACON inside. I mean could it get any better!? The chicken was so juicy and the batter was crispy and well seasoned. We were literally in food heaven. It was also remarkably affordable compared to other strip restaurants. (Don't be thrown off by the fact that they don't show their menu prices online.)

I absofreakinlutely recommend this place and I will be back when I return to Vegas."
2078,Hash House A Go Go,2,"More is more at HHAGG. 

Unfortunately, this loud, windowless, and fluorescent lit eatery focuses on quantity over quality. Their potions are so ridiculously huge that guests photograph their plates before they dive in. What they soon discover is that most dishes lack much flavor  - IHOP's buttermilk pancakes for half the $8.99 price are a thousand times better. I'd guess that 33-50% of every dish gets thrown out.

This restaurant also prides itself on being guest-unfriendly by refusing to substitute anything in their dishes. For example, if you don't eat pork and prefer their chicken sausage in your egg dish, they're more than happy to leave the pork out of the $13.99 dish, but they'll charge you an additional $5.99 to replace it with chicken sausage. WTF?

If you like to think that big portions equal value, customer service is overrated, and bad lighting and noise make for a festive dining environment, then by all means join the others here who agree! 

For those who seek out quality ingredients and flavor for their money, the ability to order what you want without getting ripped off, and a pleasant setting to dine in, then Las Vegas offers many more choices."
2079,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is a great example of a mediocre restaurant. I am a huge breakfast fan. I had been recommended by several friends who raved. I was hardly impressed. It was diner like food, average service and steep prices. The decor and aesthetic was average, once again similar to a diner. The only thing I can rave about it the display of the chicken and waffles. However, the taste wasn't even worth raving."
2080,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here based on previous reviews. Thank goodness we did. The food was amazing and the portion sizes were ridiculously large. We went in for an early dinner and was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was fairly empty, however, it was midweek so we weren't concerned. We were a group of 7 and we each chose different entrees. Each were excellent choices. The only downside was the absence of a restroom. The restaurant is located upstairs from the casino at The Quad, even though the restroom is a short trip down the escalator it is still a bit inconvenient. I wish The Quad would've considered a small restroom for patrons. Nevertheless, that will not hinder me from returning!"
2081,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food isn't great, but the portion sizes overwhelm you. Must order the beef hash or the fried chicken / waffles"
2082,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Andys sage fried chicken was the best dish I've had in my entire life!! I'm happy to hear I have one close to home in Florida! Congratulations to Hash House to go go, for creating this amazing dish!"
2083,Hash House A Go Go,4,"For breakfast and lunch, there is a long line, but the wait isn't bad (approx. 15 minutes).  it's a spacious place - lots of tables and different rooms.

HUGE portions - beware!"
2084,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is a must when you come to Vegas!!!! We had a long wait to get seated but man was it worth the wait. The portions are awesome....my girlfriend and I shared chicken and waffles and it hit the spot!!!!! This place puts roscoes chicken and waffles to shame!!!!!
2085,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was super excited to try their chicken n waffles since it's so famous !! The portions were the biggest I've ever seen in my life(not really sure if it's a good or a bad thing). The flavor of the dish was great but the chicken was super dry and overlooked. My husband had pork Benedict and he said the meat was amazing but the Benedict looked like a hard boiled egg. The decor is super cool and inviting. So overall it was nice and tasty, but work on your temperatures , especially if you claim that you dish is one of the best in the country!!!!!"
2086,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Talk about heart attack on a plate. By far one of the best experiences I've had for a hearty meal. There is a good amount of items you can choose from and make sure you go with a big group of people. I really like this place and it is definitely a go back to restaurant if you ever come back to Vegas!

Located at the Quad, this place is pretty bombay. I always wanted to try it and finally we were able to! Just to let you know, a plate of this would probably feed a family of 4 and maybe more. The portions are gigantic and full of flavor. It is definitely not for you if you're on a no carb diet LOL. I ordered a burger and a since we went in a big group, we had the pork tenderloin cutlet, man v food sage chicken, chicken pot pie, and benedicts. Everything was delicious, but my suggestion is stay away from the burgers and try something new! The burger I had was a typical burger but it was huge. The tenderloin cutlet was delicious and will be ordering that next time I go to hash house! But yes guys, you have to try this place!"
2087,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This was the worst food and service I've experienced in a long, long time. It was so disappointing, especially since we were on vacation, and all the other restaurants we went to, were so good. I was there with my daughter; they lost my order, brought the food late. My salmon was severely overcooked, and topped the worst salad I ever got. The greens I received looked liked what they would throw away. The service was as dreadful as the food. The waiter's excuse for my late and very bad meal was that they were busy. Needless to say, we will never, ever go there again - and I will skip the Imperial Palace also - even though it is part of the Caesar's Palace group - of which I am a member."
2088,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came to Vegas for Super Bowl weekend a few years ago. Came her for breakfast definitely did not disappoint yes there's a line and a weight all the time. Going back for a friends bday and yes I'll be returning again. Amazing breakfast oh and yes I highly recommend the Bloody Mary
2089,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hash hash's portions are crazy huge!!! No one finished anything! So yummy tho!
2090,Hash House A Go Go,3,"A lot of hype about this place and the bachelor party that I was at decided to come make a stop at the famous Hash House A Go Go. Overall the food is very mediocre. I didn't really get why this place was so popular and so talked about.

The portions are huge, but in the end it doesn't really matter when all that food is average. You won't find yourself wanting to finish all the food because it doesn't taste that great... 

Really don't ever have to go back here and I feel like this is one of those places you go to simply tell your friends you've been."
2091,Hash House A Go Go,5,I ordered an avocado burger thing and I was in a food coma the whole day. The price is definitely worth the quantity and quality you get. It's a feast for your eyes and stomach. Some of the most amazing food on the strip after you go out and its open 24 hrs. Our waiter was top notch with his customer service bringing us all water before even asking what we wanted. I definitely loved that I wish more places did that. I'll definitely be back :)
2092,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Oh my.  Came here with some colleagues.  If you're looking for a circa 1988 eating experience the you'll love this place.  The seizure inducing menu has a wide range of options available many of which could be directly linked to chronic heart failure.  Portions are huge...  Like proper ""that's why Americans are fat"" portions.  The service was very good and a very attentive young lady waited on our group.  Cost wasn't bad, with the six of us coming in under $200.  This spot basically isn't for me... and the moral of the story is don't trust coworkers to pick restaurants, but I've certainly had worse."
2093,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I am not a fan of casino eatery places (aside from buffets) that are on upper floors of the buildings. I feel like they are almost always desolate (at least in my experiences) and are void of any and all character that it may have if it were in it's own separate location. And this particular place was of no exception. There were three other tables (the place was a really dull atmosphere- CMON, it's vegas people!). I perhaps saw my waitress three times-including bill drop-off and pick-up and the food was not on the cheap end of things. 
I ordered Andy's sage fried chicken benedict (w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs- I subbed grilled chicken in for the fried, not like that redeems calories or anything) and it was HUGE. And contrary to other reviews, DELICIOUS. The mimosa I ordered was really strong for such a little thing and had me kind of whirling out back into the casino. I ate off that thing for two days and will definitely get it again (at the other location) next time I'm there : )"
2094,Hash House A Go Go,5,Saw Hash a GoGo on TV years ago.  Every time i come to Vegas it's a must. I always come with my best and we spilt the chicken and waffles and it's a lot of food ! Today we ordered the 22 Oz mimosas!!! We were so shocked at the cup but it's so cute !
2095,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash house a go go is a place to eat in the LINQ hotel. The place is known to have big portions of food. 

They serve all kinds of fried food and the portions are big. Inside, it is noisy, free wifi and there are no restrooms. The place is packed on weekends but you get a seat within a few minutes. The service is fast and kind. There is a bar for people to drink too.

The prices are above $10, but you get big portions of food. I have only tried their fried chicken a couple of times as that is the highlight. (It is very tasty) On the menu, there are many different alcoholic drinks as well. 

 Overall, if you want big portions of food and fried chicken, this place has the goods. I expect to come back again in the near future. It is definitely a place to check out if you are in Vegas and can't decide where to eat."
2096,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was good, portion sizes were more than you can ever eat as a single person, highly recommend sharing unless you want to eat breakfast left overs all day. Service was great, attentive and fast, tables turned over quickly. Would come here again. Corned beef hash was well seasoned, pulled corned beef not canned chopped corned beef. Highly recommend getting a side of mashed potatoes, they were buttery and had little crispy pieces of potato in it. Amazing"
2097,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We ate here twice on our week long vacation in Vegas. The food is delicious and exciting!! A bit expensive for breakfast, but the portions are huge and shareable. But if you're not into sharing, the price is worth it! The atmosphere and employees make it a fun experience too. Wish we had one closer to home!!"
2098,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best breakfast I have ever had! The brown sugar banana flapjacks were like banana foster pancakes on steroids!
2099,Hash House A Go Go,4,I was not prepared for a large platter sized pancake.   The pancake was blueberry and lemon curd; very tasty.  I could only eat a fourth.  My husband ordered eggs and sausage... just be hungry when you come. Everything I tasted was yummy.  Enjoy
2100,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I wish I could give an accurate review of the food here, unfortunately, due to ridiculous additional ""to go"" fees, even though my dish ordered was ordered without meat, they were unwilling to wave said fees, even though the restaurant was incurring less cost.  so I cannot review the food, only warn fellow allergists and vegetarians that, even though the restaurant incurs less cost, they are more than willing to add more fees.  I'll take my business elsewhere."
2101,Hash House A Go Go,5,Omgness this place serves you so much food for the price and it was amazing! Service was great to!
2102,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Portion control is thrown out the window at Hash House, in fact I'm warning you now come hungry. 

This was probably one of our top eats in Vegas, not to mention one of the few times we woke up early enough to have breakfast, oh Vegas how you screw up schedules so. 

Small wait when we got there, but nothing horrible. The service was right on when we sat down to quickly take our drink order, Tangerine Mimosa, so delicious, and coffee (this was a must just cause I rose to the morning doesn't mean I'm not dragging). I wish I would have gotten our servers name her hair was super fun, perfect mohawk, and had great suggestions for our game of 20 questions at the Hash House! 

Ordered the Hash with fresh mushrooms, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, and fresh spinach $12.95. It came with a biscuit and wedge of watermelon, all served in a giant skillet. Food was excellent, and I fully stuffed to the brim. 

Side note: Make sure you try the in house apricot jam, my table cleaned it out, sure hope they refilled it for the next customers. 

The Hash House is probably the only reason to go to the Imperial Palace beyond that steer clear of the area, tons of construction going on currently, and its a bit of a pain to navigate the ""entrance"" and park."
2103,Hash House A Go Go,3,"One of my gfs recommended this place so we wanted to try it out. This is located upstairs of the Linq hotel, it seemed really packed when we got there but the wait was only about 10 mins before we got seated. Our server introduced herself and asked for our drinks and we ordered our food. I couldn't tell if she was having a bad day or she just hated her job but she just seemed to forget about us after that and didn't really smile. All 3 of us have been servers before so we understand how stressful it can get so we gave her the benefit of the doubt. I asked for extra plates 3 times from her as well as other things and we never received them :-). On top of that it was honestly not that busy for her to just forget. So we gave up and asked other servers for help.  What made me mad was the only time I saw her smile at us was when she dropped of the check saying ""thank you guys! Take your time."" As if that's going to change the horrible service we received our first visit here. 
Other than that i'll give this place 3/5 because the food was great. The portions here are huuge so be prepared! We ordered 2 plates and shared amongst 3 girls. And had lots of left overs."
2104,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Okay... This place is amazing! Went here two days in a row. I can't find it in myself to order anything but the fried chicken benedict. Griddled mozzarella, mashed potatoes, fried chicken, bacon, sliced juicy tomatoes and fresh spinach, over a biscuit... Topped with chipotle cream sauce. Excuse me, diet what? The portion is HUGE and it's impossible to eat all of it, but it is just too good not to order. Also tried the caramel mocha which was really tasty... Not a big fan of the BLT Bloody Mary. It was way too weak and not enough spice but to be honest, the food and service made it a perfect experience both times."
2105,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Tourists trap! I admit I got sucked in. All the reviews and great press from the tv show diners drive ins and dives drew us here. Yes the portions are huge, Yes the food is good, yes you will be paying through the nose and yes you will have have or more of your plate of food thrown out because the portions are GIANT. I recommend if you visit split one plate between 2 or 3. NO JOKE! It's that big. I felt bad throwing that food out. Being a visitor in LV I don't have any way to store the food at my hotel (mini fridge is filled with food and drinks if disturbed will charge) or even reheat it if I wanted. So food flavor gets 3 the presentation is nice 4, but price (overpriced) is a 2 for sure. So combined I guess that's a 3. Bloody Mary was $15.00 with up-charge for anything other than well, waitress neglected to mention. she just asked what vodka we preferred as she rattled off a few names."
2106,Hash House A Go Go,5,My honey is addicted to this place! Very good breakfast/brunch 24/7 Las Vegas style (over the top).  He ate here three days in a row when I was at a conference then when we came back with our sons brought them too.  They finally brought me and I really enjoyed it.  Be prepared for the massive size food!!
2107,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came here during my trip to Vegas! It's like diner food on STERIODS! I honestly cant remember what I had but all times I came I ordered something different and all times it was good! Also customer service was great! Definitely a go to spot when I return.
2108,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have had a few different hash dishes and the chicken and waffles. I have to say I have only been disappointed once, that was with the smoked salmon benedict hash. The fish was very dry and bland and it really did not add anything to the benedict portion of the dish.
In addition to awesome food, they also make pretty yummy drinks- massive bloody marys and delicious coffee. 
This is definitely a favorite of mine...and everyone else too, as evident by the super long wait they have all the time. It's worth it though."
2109,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You get a lot of food, so just be aware of that. Pretty good breakfast, I would go again next time I'm in Vegas. Decent prices."
2110,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We had breakfast this past weekend about 8am on Saturday, didn't wait at all (just two of us)
We had the Chorizo Hash and their Maple Bacon Flapjacks, both were delicious"
2111,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Horrible experience from the moment we got there to the last step out the restaurant. Had to wait one hour and when we returned after checking out some slots for about 50 minutes, we found out they called our name just a few minutes earlier. This resulted in about ANOTHER  35 minute wait. Ridiculous. Our waitress seemed nice at first and progressively got less and less helpful. Orders we taken wrong, eggs prepared the wrong way. We asked for a correction and the food had to literally be re- prepared from scratch. I asked the waitress if my meal would have the same amount of chicken as the other chicken dishes and she assured me they were the same. When my dish came out i was shocked at how little chicken was in the meal. I asked her about it and she said it was supposed to be that way. What was she talking about just a few moments earlier, then?! We even asked for the manager because the experience was just that bad. The manager came by asked what was wrong. Mumbled something about getting that issue taken care of. And never heard an apology from him or the waitress. In fact we hardly ever saw him or the waitress again. Not til the meal was over. Wow. We pretty much lost our appetite just from the service alone but the lack of taste and quality in the food didn't help either. Then to top it off, a huge gnat landed and was crawling around one of our biscuits. Yummy. Yeah it's safe to say I regretted going to this place. The food was bland, carb heavy and cold. I think even IHOP or Denny's wouldve tasted better at the same price. I'm sure this isn't going to deter or impact the demand since there are so many rave reviews but my experience does not reflect the majority, sadly. I will definitely be calling their customer satisfaction line if they have one. There are only a few times I've felt insulted and outright sad from poor food and service, and this is one that is high on my personal list. I won't be back here again."
2112,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Leave it to me to visit a famous brunch place like Hash House A Go Go and, amidst all the scrumptiously savory options, opt for...

Oatmeal.

Dude, it's Vegas. More specifically, it was EDC. Salt retains water and makes you bloat. Look it up if you don't believe me.

$8.75 for a huge bowl of STEEL-CUT OATMEAL topped with mixed fresh fruit (bananas, oranges, strawberries, watermelon, blackberries, blueberries), brown sugar, and milk, with soy milk substitute for $0.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=MvpCoCsWZOkCv1zg6Wsm_A#MvpCoCsWZOkCv1zg6Wsm_A). Though this menu item won't give your taste buds a wild time (don't worry, that's what the rest of Vegas is for), the portion is huge--'Murica size huge--and filling. You probs won't finish it all. But serious kudos if you do manage to finish it all in one sitting because it's a ton of oatmeal. Literally.

But really, what better to feed me than oatmeal for EDC ;)"
2113,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great place.  Huge portions my complaint would be that we received our food before the bloody Mary's we ordered before we ordered food.   Huge portions but you pay for it.  My first time. I'll be can. KORTNI was our server.  Super nice. Loved my dog mr chow
2114,Hash House A Go Go,5,Reviews of this place was great and it didn't disappoint. Food and drinks are all wonderful. And the blueberry pancake was huge!
2115,Hash House A Go Go,5,TOP 5 Best Brunch I've ever had! No seriously I'm not kidding. Those chicken and waffles are OUT OF THIS WORLD! Huge Portions so becareful. The chicken was so juicy and crispy at the same time. The syrup was unreal and it just made everything and all the flavors burst. MUST MUST TRY! If you plan on going most likely there will be a wait. So leave 30-45 min wait on the side ready depending on the weekend in Vegas. Enjoy :)
2116,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yes the line is long, but if you have a 7 Star card you get seated almost immediately. Yay! This place has it all and to everyone's liking. I always get the steak & egg's and surprisingly I actually finish the entire thing. It's that good and everything comes out perfectly. Service and staff are great too. Definitely worth the wait and a must try place!"
2117,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House a Go Go is located inside Imperial Palace - all the way in the end. I've been here a couple of times. I wanted to try a place similar to Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles & this did it for me.

I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Breast & Waffles. The waffles are nice and fluffy; airy as you bite it. The Fried Chicken is also nice and crispy. The portion is large for a tiny person to finish. I couldn't finish the whole dish & that's probably because of all the carbs in it.

The service is mediocre. I didn't think it was exemplary. The waitress hardly checked up on us to see how we're doing or if the food was good. The hostess was no help either. 

But if you're looking for break from all the Vegas Buffets, try this place. Great for big groups!"
2118,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love, Love, Love the Hash House!! Huge portions, chicken and waffles rock!!  Can't wait to visit the one at Mohegan Sun!!! Thanks for coming to the east coast!!"
2119,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is worth the wait!  I came here recently with my boyfriend.  We had the Pork Tenderloin Benedict and the Chorizo & Jalepeno Hash with a Bloody Mary and the Banana Latte (see my pics).  The Pork Tenderloin was pounded so thin and fried crispy, I could not stop eating it.  The chorizo and jalepeno hash was also good but I could not stay away from the pork tenderloin.  The banana latte was fantastic!!!  The bloody mary is a huge drink and could use a bit more tomato juice."
2120,Hash House A Go Go,4,A great affordable place to grab breakfast. The portions are huge!! They are open 24/7 another plus.
2121,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a breakfast platter of goodness! I didn't think breakfast can be done different but they are doing it here. Long wait, but worth it. I had the corned beef hash, different really goooood! Then the ""pancake"" singular because all you need is one they are big. I had the banana pancake and it really did not need syrup!"
2122,Hash House A Go Go,5,My mom and I came and stayed at the Plaza fir two nights. We had breakfast here both days. The food and service were amazing....Sausage Gravy to die for. Split at plate like we did plenty of food....
2123,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go was recommended to us by a friend. I'm glad we took his advice! The wait for seating was brief and comfortable (there's plenty to look at on the walls and around). We were seated at a small table, which is always a concern for us (people who order a lot of food to sample), but the table was large enough for our order. We ordered ""The Tractor Driver Combo"" (Buttermilk flapjack served with two eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes. You can make it a HH signature flapjack by adding $2 bucks. You can also substitute a waffle or French toast by adding $2 bucks (we substituted with the french toast and ordered eggs cooked over-hard with bacon) and ""The Big O Sage Fried Chicken and Waffle Tower"", (two Sage fried chicken breasts, smoked bacon waffle, hot maple reduction, fried leeks and served with two eggs.) My goodness, what a mountain of food! We couldn't possibly finish everything, but not for lack of trying. I can't express how large the portions were. It was absolutely the best breakfast we shared in Las Vegas and we will happily pass forward the recommendation."
2124,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Pros:
Large quantity
More carbs/less protein

Cons:
Lacks flavor
Long wait time 
Confusing menu
Tourist trap all the way !!"
2125,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portion size ain't no joke here! Huge plates with tons of food. It's best to share a plate with someone. I ordered the fried chicken Benedict and boy was it tasty! The mashed potatoes that came with it were so flavorful and soft.

Service was really great. The waitress forgot one of the meals at our table and was very apologetic and even brought over the manager to apologize to us, which I really didn't think was necessary, but she did comp us for that entree which was very nice of her. 

I would come here again. Just make sure you have a big appetite!"
2126,Hash House A Go Go,1,"If a place can get by from being on a Food Network show alone, this is it. The signature chicken blows. Why? Because rosemary doesn't pair well with chicken. And it needs to be crispy, not soggy. Same goes for the ""crispy"" potatoes; soggsville. The bacon was as limp as Don Rickles's dick. Not sure what would have happened if asked for crispy. Also, way overpriced. $3 for a cup of coffee that tastes like it was filtered through the tighty whiteys you wore on the plane to Vegas? No thanks. Finally, they couldn't even manage to get the dishes out together for a party of two. Come on; that's just lazy."
2127,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've heard a lot about Hash House from various food shows, so I decided to seek it out on my most recent trip to Vegas. The restaurant is located in the Quad (formerly Imperial Palace), which is currently under construction. What an endeavor to find this place! You certainly wouldn't just stumble upon it. We had to go down a ramp, past the hotel check-in, towards a small elevator. 
I glad we didn't give up. Our server was very friendly and enthusiastic. Sure enough, the portions were huge! I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was amazing! It was a huge tower of four waffles with strips of bacon in the middle, topped with two large chicken breasts. Like I said, the bacon waffle was filled with large pieces of real bacon. The coating on the chicken was really good, fried and sort of sweet and carmelized. The teriyaki sauce on the rim of the plate went really well with the chicken--I should have ordered more on the side.
Our meals were so good that we decided to return two days later. The food is a great value for the price, and everything is cooked really fresh. It's worth the maze to find this place. And it's open 24/7 


Visited June 2013"
2128,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My buddies and I were in Vegas to relax for a few days and wanted an honest breakfast. You can't go wrong with Hash House. The combination of great service, delicious food and huge man size portions for your money keep me coming back on every visit to town. 

I recommend the pancakes, chicken and waffles, omelettes and great coffee. A lot of Vegas restaurants on the strip are a rip off. Hash house is not. Stay true to your strategy and thanks."
2129,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you are craving some Chicken and Waffles this is the place to go. At $16.95 you get  two portions of white meat chicken and waffles with bacon strips sandwiched inside.

GOOD:
* SAGE FRIED CHICKEN WITH STACKED BACON WAFFLES (17):
   - You can taste the sage in the fried chicken and is best if you include a bite of the fried leeks that they scatter around the plate. The waffles are nice and thick with strips of bacon layered inside. Not like other places where they chop the bacon into bits and mix it into the batter. The only downer is that the waffles are a bit limp and has lost any ""crunch"" to the exterior. Which I have learned through America's Text Kitchen is because there is too much moister in the batter or maybe the steam from the bacon did it. For the price and the size its a nice brunch that will tide you over till dinner or snack time, which ever comes first.

OKAY:
* its hard to get to this place because it is inside Imperial Palace, which is undergoing a renovation.
* if you are slow to wake-up, then be ready to get more rest as you wait for a table to open up. They don't have enough staff for the number of customers who want in."
2130,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hash House is an extremely unique brunch spot. Before heading to Vegas, I researched all of the different places that I had to try and Hash House was at the top of my list. As they are famous for their ""Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict"" I knew that I had to order it. The portions were enormous and even though I was super hungry, I couldn't even make a dent in my meal. The flavors were unique. I tasted notes of sweet and savory but overall the meal was just OK. I love unusual variations of eggs benny but maybe this was just too far from the ""norm"" for me that it left a little to be desired. There were just too many competing flavors and textures in one dish. The mashed potatoes at the middle of dish were the star of the show but when eating eggs benny you want the meat, eggs, or sauce to shine."
2131,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food is pretty good but give me a f**king break. Unless at least 3 people are going to share a plate, you should feel guilty for eating here. Guilty for commiting the sin of gluttony, guilty for punishing your body, guilty for the toilets you will destroy later.  There is no reason a single human being should be consuming one portion of any dish here. 

If when you sit around the house, you actually sit around the house, then eat here.

If you sweat gravy, then eat here.

If you're so large you have your own area code, then eat here.  

If you order pigs in a blanket and the waitress bring over a snuggie and wraps you up in it, then eat here. 

Perfect for fat asses and people who desire to develop or augment health problems. Eat away fatty!!"
2132,Hash House A Go Go,4,"MMMM big portions of oily food!! It was good , but i suggest you share! Got the Chicken benedict. It was heavy and we did not finish it. nonetheless good for the price!"
2133,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was decent, wait was long, service was superb, price was spectacularly affordable and portions are large. If you have a large appetite and are willing to wait, this place is for you or I'd find something to do in the meantime if I were you. Btw, tmobile has no reception upstairs."
2134,Hash House A Go Go,4,Make sure you have a very big appetite! The portions here is huge! We ordered the chicken and waffles and scramble eggs with cheese and bacon! Chicken and waffles was delicious! The spicy Bloody Mary was a nice surprise- it came with a side toast and you pretty much make your own BLT! We will definitely come back again to try the eggs Benedict!
2135,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is ridiculous. Believe the hype! The portions are obviously enormous, and even the bloody marys are huge. Service was GREAT, but the ambience is a little chaotic. It's fun though! But expect some noise and fluorescent lighting. But that's the whole kitschy vibe of this place! I got the chorizo hash and it was outstanding. Everything was solid. Really enjoyed my time here!"
2136,Hash House A Go Go,3,"What I really admire about this place is the emphasis they put on making everything from scratch and using high quality ingredients. It's written in fine print on the bottom of their menu, along with a little notification that your food may take awhile to prepare because of it. (Our waiter quoted us 45 minutes for our food to be done after we ordered.)

As for the food though, I was pretty underwhelmed. We ordered the Chicken Benedict, Chicken and Waffles, a smoked salmon scramble and a chicken hash dish. The portions here are very large. Four dishes fed 7 girls, and we probably would have been just fine with 3 entrees instead of being greedy and adding the fourth.

The star of the show was the Chicken Benedict. Delish! The sauce and melted cheese... Mmm.. The flavor is different from your traditional Benedict with hollandaise sauce, and well worth your time. 

Everything else we ordered though kind of fell flat for me. Bland... Boring... A waste of my stomach space. I was looking forward to the chicken and waffles most but I had a few bites and abandoned it. 

The wait to be seated and the wait to get your food is a little unbearable, especially when you're hungover from your Vegas shenanigans the night prior. But I would come back just for that benedict!"
2137,Hash House A Go Go,5,Fun unique breakfast dishes!  Superior fried chicken and huge portions.  Excellent waitstaff!
2138,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place has gained so much Popularity that we felt guilty for not trying, so we made the reservation the day before and showed up on time.  The place was packed but they sat us down in less then five minutes, great deal.  First thing I noticed is that the music is too loud and everyone is screaming around you to carry a normal conversation.  We ordered almost right away and then it took 45 minutes to get the food.  The portions were huge, even the kids menu items.  Taste wise, everything was solid 3 stars but value is 5.  You could actually share a meal with another person and both be satisfied.  My honest opinion, a lot of hype not enough substance.  Another 45 minutes here and the noise would have driven me crazy.  See pics for the dishes we ordered."
2139,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Way way too long of waits to get brunch. SO many other places in Vegas you can get a good breakfast/brunch with half the wait time. The service was bad the food was okay, I did not like my food. But, I had bites of the other people in our group and their food wasn't bad. Although none of our food came out very hot. The bacon was good. I ordered an eggs benedict that had a marinara like sauce on it instead of hollandaise sauce, it was really gross!  We will not be back. It is a shame because we have a Hash House A go go in my area, San Diego and I will NOT try it because of the awful experience at the Vegas Strip location."
2140,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fried chicken and waffles were off the hook.  Dishes are definitely large enough to split.  Great food, beautifully presented, terrific service.  The wait is definitely worth it."
2141,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House is definitely something special! I went here after hearing that it was a Man VS Food favorite. I was very impressed with how the restaurant could serve ungodly portions, yet still give each dish unique touches that gave the presentation a touch of delicate class.

Not to mention my pancake was as big as my torso. Now that's worth at least 4 stars!"
2142,Hash House A Go Go,3,The portions are huge... I wanted a simple eggs benny but with no meat. I subbed meat for avocado which tasted amazing! I was very shocked at how large the portions are though... my eggs benny was on top of a massive pile of mashed potatoes. My biscuit kept getting lost in the potatoes which sucked since the biscuit was fluffy and delicious. I wouldn't go back just because the food was way too big.. my plate looked like it could feed 3 people. My drink was amazing and the waiter was very nice and hilarious.. good customer service
2143,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ok. This place lives up to the reviews. Great food huge portions. The bacon bacon bacon appetizer is a must!  We ended up splitting a chicken Benedict, ( I can't remember the exact name ). This was extraordinary!  Will definitely be back"
2144,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First of all, THANK YOU to the person on here who gave the tip about sitting at the bar. We didn't have to wait at all so that as great! We enjoyed our breakfasts, I had eggs, bacon and a huge pancake, hubby had an enormous ham and cheese omelet. The only bummer was that they were out of the tea I wanted so I ordered coffee then found out they don't have non-dairy creamer, boo, what about lactose intolerant people? It was pricey ($40 for 2 of us for breakfast) but I would go back."
2145,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I mean. 

If your goal is an Instagram-worthy photo of a plate of food the size of your head, this is your place. Big on portions, not so big on taste. I had the...whatever they said was their version of eggs benedict that was on Man vs. Food (I think?). There wasn't much eggs benedict-y about it, rather I assume they were like 'hey, what can we throw on a plate and see if it kills a person in one sitting?' Biscuits, fried chicken, chipotle cream sauce/Queso/something, bacon, fried cheese blanket of some sort, eggs...and spinach and tomatoes, because health. On a bed of potatoes. With a knife jammed through it just to really drive the point home. And some fried spaghetti garnish in the middle for no apparent reason whatsoever.

It didn't really meld well together, and the fried chicken was dry and kind of tasteless (WHITHER, SAGE?). I ended up poking around in it/deconstructing it and eating what was good (bacon, biscuits, potatoes, CHEESE BLANKET). It was honestly enough food for 3-4 people, but it wasn't great food. That fried cheese blanket was baller, though. 

Travis with the giant mohawk was our server and he was pretty good. He did bust my friend's chops for ordering 'just' the junior cheeseburger, and dudes: it was enough for a couple of people. Overall I guess what I'm saying is: maybe don't get sucked in. Unless you're super hungover and just need copious amounts of greasy food. And cheesey blankets."
2146,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Two times i go to this place different weeks and two times the same thing happens. 

I'm used to waiting at the HHAGG on Sahara - not a problem 30-40 minutes , maybe, i can live with it. So it came as no surprise when i tried the Imperial Palace i was told it was 40 minutes for a table. Not a problem. So i start walking around, checking out the restaurant, when i notice - THE PLACE IS LESS THAN 1/2 FULL. Okay, so i meander back up to the front - ask the guy , what gives, "" The kitchen is backed up . "" hmm, backed up, why ? the place ain't full ! so i wait a few another 10 minutes, no one is seated. Can't help myself, walk around again, EVERY TABLE HAS THEIR FOOD ! So again , i walk up to inquire, "" we're short on wait staff ."" i politely, ask to remove my name from the list. Later.... 

So wouldn't you know, I'm back again, this time gf has a comp, she wants a big 'ol pancake, i have my doubts , but let's try it again ....it's deja-frickin' vu all over again....same scene - 1/2 empty - 50 minute wait this time - f you very much ! 

and to think i used to recommend the Sahara location to others .......... F THAT !"
2147,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I agree with other Yelpers. This place was totally overrated. It wasn't bad but it was a huge amount of food that just made you feel sick at the end.  This place made Claim Jumper portions look like a joke.

Reservations - If you come at dinner, there is no wait. It's on the second floor, escalators in the back of the hotel will lead you up.

Service - Stellar

Price - Amazing for what you get.

Food - 
1. Biscuits - The biscuits are the size of your palm, drizzled in honey and with whipped butter.  Nice and flaky but a little dense.
2. Sage Fried Chicken with Waffles - DRY and boring.  The platter was big enough to fit a turkey on Thanksgiving.  You never taste the sage in the batter and the only sauce is the maple caramel reduction.  Four waffles, two huge boneless chicken breast and fried green leeks. I need some gravy!
3. Indiana Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin - Ok, I have to admit this was pretty good.  A huge flattened pork tenderloin, breaded and crispy on top of carmelized and melted cheesey mash with onions, mushrooms, spinach and tomato sauce.  The bbq cream added a slight richness but wasn't overpowering."
2148,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I, too, am confused about all the hype this place gets. Be fair warned...we waited 20-30 minutes on am early Friday morning to be seated. I wasn't prepared for the additional 20-30 minutes after we ordered to receive our food!!! If you're really hungry you'll have to wait - which may be good because their portions are huge. 

I made the mistake of ordering the side of egg and potatoes with my pancake. Trust me, the pancake alone is plenty big to satisfy your hunger. I ordered the blackberry granola pancake and liked it. My husband ordered the chicken. The biscuits are huge and tasty.

For the wait and quality of the food I don't understand the hype. Maybe it's the portion sizes? I found the food to taste right on par with other diner food that is cheaper elsewhere. But it stays packed with people!"
2149,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So our first stop was Hash House A Go Go, as seen on both Food Network (Chefs Vs. City) and Travel Channel (Man vs. Food and Food Paradise). We got the Sage fried Chicken and waffles. Just so we're clear, I totally forgot about this, but bacon is cooked into the waffle. I repeat the bacon is in the waffle. Four waffles piled on each other, with two pieces of fried chicken at the top skewered by a stick of sage, covered with fried leeks and drizzled with maple syrup (Don't worry syrup lovers, they also give you a little dish of more syrup). Fried Chicken and Waffles are my jam, I don't like eggs so I don't have a lot of breakfast foods I do like, but this combines the best of not just both worlds, but all worlds. The chicken was moist and juice, had a fantastic crisp noise when you broke into it. And the waffles, crisp enough with slabs of bacon just hanging out. All combined with maple syrup and you have a winning combination. We heeded many warnings and split it between two of us. Because of that we also allowed ourselves a side of crispy potatoes, which were good, just paled in comparison to whatever else we had going on on our tastebuds. It was all very intense, we got there around 9, just missing massive crowds, and we didn't eat again until dinner."
2150,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After a night of drinking and partying we came to the right place for brunch.  This is a ode to excess.  My husband and I decided to order two dishes and split them.  Well one would have been more than enough.  Don't get me wrong, the food was so delicious, but there was so much, I think we could have fed a small family.  We had Andy's sage fried chicken benedict and one brown sugar banana pancake.  The pancake was the size of big frisbee.  It was HUGE!!! Of course I had to have a mimosa, you know, hair of the dog, is that the saying???  We ended up leaving half of our meals, not because they were not delicious, but we were stuffed.  The fried chicken benedict was great, huge portion of fried chicken cooked to perfection.  I had this meal around noon and I didn't eat again until the next day.  Next time I am in Las Vegas, I will stop by here, there are still so many items I want to try."
2151,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Whats up with these portions?? I felt like a lil fat hungry kid at the table. My pancake was about a foot in diameter making the large sides of eggs and crispy potatoes looking miniature in comparison!! Glancing at the size of the meal i knew i wasn't going to be able to finish it all and thought ""something this big can't taste good??""...right?? Wrong, the food was great. I do recommend the french toast over the pancake but it was good, good enough to remove the hangover i had. Our server was chipper and she had lots of jokes which made the experience even better, i think her name was Denise?"
2152,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food, fantastic service, large portions! What more could you ask for? We went for breakfast and were not disappointed. The place was packed but our server (he has mohawk) was awesome, quick and took good care of us!"
2153,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here around 1am after some fun on the slots downstairs. Everyone we encountered, from host to wait staff, bussers and even the cook were incredibly friendly and helpful.
This was our first visit, so we had questions, and everyone was able to answer them in detail. As this is inside a resort, it seems staff are well prepared to handle varying levels of drunkenness. I was just silly, but we also got to witness some pretty belligerent patrons go from cranky to polite in no time with a couple conversations with Keith. 

All of the food, in its novelty giant portions, was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My husband and I each had one of their stuffed burgers, accompanied with sweet potato fries on mine and regular with his. I am a bottomless pit and was able to take down their mashed-potato-filled monstrosity, but my husband was defeated by their mushroom mountain of a burger. 
Their high standard for food continues into dessert. Yes I got dessert. 
And it was everything I had hoped it would be. 

I shared a picture of the perfect slab of cheesecake they served. I may just go back for that again, as that caramel beauty still visits my dreams."
2154,Hash House A Go Go,2,The cook couldn't make just regular dipped french toast.  My girlfriend's breakfast was simply bland.  But worst of all we waited over 10 minutes at our table to be acknowledged.   Waitress was MIA most of our visit.   Maybe the place was understaffed?  Although there were at least 5 or 6 hostesses standing around.   Won't visit again!
2155,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First time and will definitely have to go a 2nd time! While there were a lot of great things there were a few areas for improvement I identified.  Any place that has an assortment of mimosas flavors gets my vote I had the option of tangerine, pineapple, Apple and I can't even remember the rest I was pleasantly overwhelmed.  Speaking of overwhelmed the portion sizes here are out of this world you definitely get what you pay for here it's amazing to see what comes from the kitchen.  I only went to get a nibble so I got a couple of sides, a side of bacon, biscuits and gravy, and a side of crispy fried potatoes.  I like my bacon crispy not burnt a room for improvement include being able to decipher between the two while my bacon wasn't completely burned and edible it was crisper than I usually prefer. The biscuit was not as soft as I like and surprising as things normally smothered in a gravy such as biscuits and gravy tend to be on the soft side, but not mine. The crispy potatoes were awesome the only thing that could have made them top notch would have been to add onions and peppers to them. All in all the experience was great our server attentive and will receive a 2nd visit from me to get a true meal."
2156,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The three people that I went with thought the food was okay and the portions were huge. I ordered the corned beef hash and fried eggs over medium with a biscuit. What I got was two raw eggs and tiny strips of corned beef on top of hash browns and a biscuit with a small tree sticking out of it... no butter, no jelly! After eating a bite of eggs then realizing they were clear/uncooked inside. I returned them to the waiter asking for the whites to be cooked. TWENTY TWO minutes later I received two eggs fried completely hard... Needless to say, everyone was finished eating by then and we just paid the bill and left. I should have tried the pancakes... you cant really screw up a pancake."
2157,Hash House A Go Go,2,"As far as I'm concerned, Adam Richman can keep this place. I really was not impressed with hash house, I ordered their bacon, avacado, and swiss scramble along with crispy potatoes and a bisquit. The eggs were really runny and not appetizing, I love eggs and I was severely disappointed by this, the best part of them was the bacon mixed in, but even then it was overpowered by the eggy, soggy mass (needless to say, I didn't finish them) the potatoes were ok, but not memorable, the best part of the breakfast was the biscuit wich was very good, it was light on the inside with a crisp crust and had a hint of rosemary in it, delicious! i didn't need butter or jam with it. The other problem with hash house was the portions, they give you way too much on one trough sized plate, it's intimidating to see when it comes out, it makes you feel that every meal was an eating competition of it's own, no wonder man vs. food went there. Next time Adam Richman says to eat somewhere, do your own investigation and skip this place and go to Bobby Flay's MESA for their awesome brunch."
2158,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Be prepared to go home with leftovers! The portions are ridiculously large, which isn't a bad thing! My sister's pancake was the size of a hubcap, my other sister's fried chicken and waffles were a humongous tower, and my dad's chicken pot pie barely looked like he had touched it when he'd finished. Only issue was that the chicken pot pie really needed salt and pepper and was a bit dry so we ordered extra sauce for it. The favorite of the table was my sage fried chicken, which I also of course had to take to go. The complimentary biscuits served are softball sized (maybe bigger) and come with this really good honey butter, we also got homemade strawberry jam. Everything was so rich and delicious that we all left uncomfortably full. So make sure to pace yourself! 

Final Notes: The service on a Wednesday night at 7 was really quick for us. Our server was also funny which was a bonus. They have free WiFi since there's zero reception in the LINQ."
2159,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love this place!! If you are on a diet, don't come here. Large portions and great tasting food. The pancake was about the size of a hubcap... No joke !!"
2160,Hash House A Go Go,4,"In my short visit to Vegas, this place had a secure spot on my ""to-do/must-eat"" list. So for my first morning I headed over, sat at the bar and ordered the sage fried chicken (""featured on MvF!"").

Before I talk about the food itself, the staff there were fantastic, friendly and quick, and served with a smile and generous quick wit. That was certainly a pleasure! 

To go with my food, I had an apple juice and here they serve it unfiltered which is just the way I like it. When my (massive) meal arrived, it certainly looked very impressive with a tall sprig of thyme next to a steak knife impaling the food. The food itself, however, was on the bland side given the presentation (and my sky-high expectations I suppose). 

Don't get me wrong, it was all well-cooked and all but with the chicken and everything else drowned in the creamy sauce/gravy, there was not much going on.

I'm still awarding four stars to Hash House, for good service and presentation. Food-wise it's one star down but only based on one visit and only trying one dish. Everyone else there looked happy!"
2161,Hash House A Go Go,2,"If massive portions and long waits are your thing, then go for it. I had the fried chicken Benedict and while tasty it ultimately left me feeling messy and gross. I see the appeal, it's just too much for me.

The tangerine juice was aces, though."
2162,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portions were HUGE. Food was good but service was seriously lacking. I knew I couldn't eat enough to make it worth ordering a full meal. So I ordered an extra kids meal for my children and shared it with them. I was lectured about them not being able to accommodate that. Ultimately they did but not without making me uncomfortable and feeling less than warm. 

Will eat here again but will want a children's portion again I'm sure."
2163,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Excellent food, I had the blueberry pecan pancakes and enjoyed them but there's too much food to eat it all. The Bloody Mary is also excellent and has some spice. Service was VERY friendly and I'll be back here. I'm taking one star away because we had to wait 30 mins for breakfast on a weekday morning while over half of the restaurant was empty."
2164,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG amazing. I have lived in Vegas almost a year now and have been dying to try this place.

it totally met my expectations. The waiter was nice and friendly, the food was AMAZING and the atmosphere is great.

I went at 7 in the morning and the place was poppin already! Love it! I recommend the bacon waffle, so good."
2165,Hash House A Go Go,5,Really good! Huge portions that are so worth the wait in line (which can be up to an hour but is so worth it)! I come here whenever I come to Vegas for breakfast/brunch and sometimes even dinner!
2166,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're willing to wait 40-45 minutes during peak hours, it's an excellent place. Food servings are generous! Bring your appetite. Corned beef hash has always been my favorite at any diner and this place serves the best one yet"
2167,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food, great service, huge portions. Didn't love the Bloody Mary, but everything else was on point."
2168,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Waited a ridiculous amount of time to be seated, take our orders, and bring the food out. The wait for the food was the longest and we only had three people in our group. Didn't think the food was that great either. Sorry Hash House but I did not become a fan."
2169,Hash House A Go Go,4,I had the famous sage chicken and waffles. It was okay. I did like how they cooked the bacon inside the waffle but that's really it. The presentation was gorgeous! The taste is average just like chicken and waffles. Nothing special. The sage chicken Benedict was huge. Enough for 2 people. That was pretty good. The drink menu looked delicious.
2170,Hash House A Go Go,3,It was alright. Worth the wait and the excessive calories? That's up to you. For me... I've had better food and the staff are so stressed out likely from sooooooo many people that go there.
2171,Hash House A Go Go,3,Suck service. Good food. Look like people that work there just there for pay check. Food was really good
2172,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Awesome food.  Go with four people or less.  With a bigger party it will take too long to get seated.  A smaller group and you won't be able to try enough stuff.   Get some of the specialty cocktails, and the snickers pancake.  Thank me later....and walk back to your hotel to work off the calories."
2173,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've been wanting to try this place since I love potatoes and finally got to for breakfast on my last day in Vegas. Thanks to the hostess who seated us and told us that the portions are huge and big enough to share, A and I split the roasted chicken hash. I didn't like the chicken very much and the potatoes didn't have much flavor but we got a lot of food for what we paid so the value was definitely there. This is located in the LINQ hotel and was the cheapest meal we had. Aside from the food, the waitress was super nice but the ambiance was definitely overall super dark and a bit gloomy."
2174,Hash House A Go Go,5,If you are looking for fried Chechen waffle this is the place. They make the best of this kind and large portion and the price is great. There are multiple location if u don't want to wait on the strip. I love love this place and have to stop by every time. They have bacon pressed between the waffle... Inside of it... How genius.
2175,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Stayed at The Linq Hotel this past weekend during their official re-opening (formerly The Quad hotel) for my friend's Halloween Bachelorette Weekend...while my hotel stay was awful, Hash House A Go Go was probably the best part of my stay at The Linq! lol

After returning to my room from a night out and realizing that I was STARVING, I decided to head down to the lobby around 4am and see what was open and order food to bring back to the room. I was thrilled to see that the restaurant was open 24hrs and was directed to the bar to place my take out order. The restaurant itself didn't seem super large but had a cool, comfortable and casual vibe. 

The late night menu wasn't extensive, but it had just what I was in the mood for...Steak & Eggs! For about $15, the special came with a boneless Rib-Eye steak, Scrambled Eggs, Mashed Potatoes & Biscuit. I also ordered an Orange Jc which came out to like $6! If I had known, I probably would've skipped the juice. The wait was a bit long for my order, but when it arrived I remembered to ask for butter & A-1 sauce for my steak before I returned to my room to dive into my food. 

Of course I wasn't expecting the plating to be as beautiful as the pictures I've seen for the regular dishes served in the restaurant (lol), but when I opened my take out container I was NOT expecting that much food!!! LOL The portions are HUGE! Two people could've easily shared the meal for sure. 

First of all, my steak was perfectly cooked, flavorful and SO delicious. The scrambled eggs were large, fluffy folds and were really good. The mashed potatotes were thick, well seasoned, tasty and could probably feed an army. And the best thing next to the steak was the biscuit. The biscuit was BIG! It was soft and slightly doughy in the middle (but in a good way!)...it was so perfect with the whipped butter! I was in heaven and really glad that no one could witness me eating this amazing meal in my hotel bed! 

Looking forward to returning here and actually dining in the restaurant!"
2176,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Not sure when was it but I saw Hash House A Go Go's crazy waffle picture on Instagram and I told myself I need to visit Hash House A Go Go once in my life. Took a random trip to Vegas and was so hungry after I got off from the plane... opened my Yelp app and found Rodney H's review. Oh my, Hash House A Go Go in Vegas? Guess it was my lucky day!

...Or not so lucky because I was eating alone. I knew I wouldn't be able to finish a meal but I still order the famous Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. The portion... was huge and beyond, and this was the time I regret coming to Hash House A Go Go alone. The chicken was a bit dry than I expected, the waffle was good but didn't reach the crunchy-feel I was looking for -- that's alright, as long as it's not soggy -- Overall SFCW was amazing and it would definitely better for 2-3 people to share. 

I also got the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade with Vodka. It was very refreshing and I love how they snipped a piece of watermelon on the side. The color was very appetizing too.

The restaurant very roomy but very dark, it was hard to take good photos at my seating area. However it did fulfill my desire of chicken & waffle and most importantly, my hanger! I would suggest to come here with a group of friends and get a taste of everything!"
2177,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food at Hash House A Go Go was really good.

Unfortunately, we had to wait a really long time to get it. 

It's awesome when a place is popular, and I don't mind waiting if the expectations are set right. But the staff at Hash House A Go Go was severely underestimating wait times and discouraging people from leaving the lobby of the restaurant. This was undoubtedly costing revenue from the casino, where people might have entertained themselves while waiting. Perhaps a cell phone alert system would help Hash House A Go Go manage the wait?

Once we were seated, our excellent waiter promptly warned us that the kitchen was operating on a 45 minute delay. This was annoying, but since the waiter set those expectations, we were able to cope.

The food arrived and my God, these portion sizes were out of control. I could easily have shared my meal with 1.5, maybe 2 other people. There was so much food that I couldn't stop feeling guilty about the inevitable waste, because even if scrambled eggs reheated well, I had no place to refrigerate them in my hotel room. The pancakes were the size of vinyl records, and my biscuit was bigger than a regulation-sized softball. It was insane.

All that said, the food was delicious. Really good! My chicken hash was well-seasoned and the hash browns were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the huge side of fruit was fresh. My husband's bowl of oatmeal, aside from being giant, also came laden with tons of fresh fruit. We all liked our food.

If Hash House A Go Go got their queue style in order and reduced their portion sizes to something resembling a responsible serving, they'd easily earn 4 stars from me. As for now, this is place I'd enjoy going again but wouldn't bother waiting in that line for."
2178,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love everything about this place. The food and service were excellent and prices were reasonable. I would definitely love to go back to try out other menu items. The only con is that they would not let me customize my eggs. I wanted egg whites instead of the whole eggs, but apparently that is not allowed."
2179,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is a go to for us every time that we are in Las Vegas!  Each meal is so large that two can share.  Chicken and waffles are awesome!
2180,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Had the experience to visit the talked about place. My experience was awful the hostesses were unprofessional.  It was an hour forty minute wait - which at the time wasn't a problem, but once our name was called my friend  went down to the casino while we waiting.  I tell her she's on her way and she goes to tell we can be seat until all parties are available.  It was only two of us. Within five minute my friend was back upstairs - we finally get seated, our waiter comes introduced himself, take our order, bring our drinks never asked did we want water.  It was every bit of forty five minutes before our food came and guess what it took another twenty minute for my Hash Cobb salad to arrive, by that time I didn't want the salad I want to go our waiter never came over or nothing until I sent back the late salad.  My overall experience was horrible and the manager and staff was just disrespectful."
2181,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are insane! I made the mistake of thinking I could eat the burger and red velvet pancake!!! 

I gave it my best try but omg it was too much. Although they are known for their breakfast, their burgers are totally legit. I had the number 5 which had 3 patties OMG!!!

Do yourself a favor, get a red velvet pancake with extra topping, you will be speechless."
2182,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and service! Better show up hungry!

We had breakfast on Saturday 10/17/17. Place was very busy but staff was awesome! 

Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed."
2183,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My daughter, my friend, and I ate here three weeks ago. The food was delicious, our server wasn't so great, (which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5) and the wait seem like forever,  it was actually a little over an hour. Yes, it was worth it! Everything is cook per order and the portion are OVERSIZE. There's no way you can watch your weight eating here. lol. Overall I adore this little gem in Imperial Palace. Although the waiter wasn't great, I still left him a hefty tip. Maybe he was stress, from the morning chaos. :)"
2184,Hash House A Go Go,1,Quality of food has dramatically gone down. Been here 2 times in the last 3 months and was deeply dissapointed...have in mind that you make line for an hour and then another 45-60 mins for the food. They wont quote that when you give your name. And sadly you cant get any appetizers or any food because they go in order of ticket. Wint be back.
2185,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love 24 hours of food! Yes, you got that right, 24 hours.  I luckily had the pleasure of being in close proximity to the location at the Quad without even knowing.  So glad I was. I experienced the early morning crowd (I'm not sure how people get up for breakfast in Vegas, I just happened to be waiting for my hotel room to be ready) and  the late night I should eat a lot of food before I make it back to my hotel room at 4am.  

It's a ton of food, it's all good.  Also, the alcoholic drinks are amazing at any time of day. It's fairly large,but wait times can be really long.  I noticed in the morning it's good to get there before 9:30am, the rush comes about then.  Late night, no worries, you'll be fine.

I could tell you what I ate, but it really doesn't matter, it was good.  That's all you need to know.  Go there pick something interesting and eat it.  Your mouth will thank you."
2186,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Awesome portion. Staff there is very helpful and friendly. However the salmon Benedict is not what I'm looking for. BTW, the chicken waffle is a must!"
2187,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food looks appealing, big portions and i was so excited to try it.
Sadly huge disappointment, in order to make their portions big they use a lot of smashed potatoes with no taste at all, that dries up the entire portion.
I have ordered the fried chicken Benedict and they served scrambled egg with a little hollandai sauce which was total disappointing 
If you wanna take pictures try this place but don't expect a tasty dish"
2188,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My cousins have been here, and we almost went one time while in Vegas.  The wait was too long, so we never went.  

On a trip to Vegas during the week, my boyfriend and I decided to go and try it out.  We walked in, no wait, PERFECT.  Our server was Josh.  He was super friendly and great.  We had the 100oz of Fat Tuesday's, and he talked to us for a while about it and helped me with transferring some into a different container.  

We went for lunch and ordered the Sage Fried Chicken with the bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks and Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs.  They came out with the quickness, but then again they weren't all too busy.

Both were amazing!!!! Try them.  The only thing I didn't like as much was the chipotle cream.  It was too thick.  Prices were also reasonable for the portions.  I'll definitely come back. :) Thank you Josh"
2189,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Some travelers get their kicks from group tours and antiquing.  I get mine from finding great places to eat breakfast.  I'm not really sure how I began my love affair with artery-clogging hash browns and German chocolate pancakes, but I don't forsee it ending any time soon.  I'm of the opinion that the very best breakfasts weigh down your tummy like a bowling ball made of sausage, which is probably why I had such a blast at Hash House-A-Go-Go.

On the recommendation of a friend who used to live in Vegas, my girlfriend and I ate at Hash House on the second day of our recent vacation.  I ordered eggs mixed with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes and (I believe) basil, served with a homemade biscuit and fried mashed potatoes.  I've had goat cheese and sundried tomatoes together on pizza but never mixed in eggs.  The combination was every bit as tasty as I'd hoped it would be.  The fried mashed potatoes took me back to the pre-microwave days of my childhood, when my mom would reheat the mashed potatoes she'd made the day before in a pan filled with melted butter.  The biscuit, which was significantly denser than I'd thought it would be, felt like it weighed half a pound.  If I'd eaten it with butter and jelly, I might not have felt very fondly about it.  However, on our table was a small metal tin filled with delicious jellied peaches, which turned out to be the perfect topping for Hash House's ridiculously heavy pastries.

Hash-House-A-Go-Go offers friendly service and excellent breakfast food served at reasonable prices.  For me, the best part of my Hash House experience was watching my tiny girlfriend try to eat a giant pancake that was at least 18"" in diameter.  She literally begged me to help her finish it but I was halfway to a food coma myself.  You win this round, breakfast!  But I'll be back.  Sooner or later, I'm always back for more."
2190,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Picture it ( Sophia from Golden Girls voice) Thursday morning, 11AM. Line out the door to the escalators. Friendgirl wanted to go here, so that's where we ended up. I honestly think that there is so much good food and new places to explore while in Vegas, why go back to the same places unless you go to Vegas all the time (4+ year or more)?! Anyhoo. We had a looooong wait. At least 50 minutes. The time went by quickly as there was a lot of to keep my eyeballs entertained. Finally we embark upon the table. We decided to get the chicken and waffles. Not really what I wanted by my friend loves chicken and waffles anywhere and we already knew that it comes in a jumbo size and she didn't want to carry leftovers around all day. DEEP SIGH. So they were good. I liked the fact that the chicken didn't have a bone in it, but my chicken could have been seasoned a wee bit more. The waffles have bacon bits in the batter and they were delicious! Service was fast as all of the waitstaff hustles."
2191,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You have to go there because it's an institution, you just have to.  I normally don't eat fried chicken, but that was the most amazing fried chicken ever.  the waffles had bacon in them too, yum.  However, this is not a place to go if you are looking for a small portion.  Although it was good, I think of it as a once in a lifetime splurge that I never need to have again because it was sinfully delicious!  My husband had the biscuit thing, that was really good too."
2192,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Still not a huge fan of Hash House a Go Go, but this is a convenient location and it's usually pretty popping. 

I typically order breakfast, as I do at the rest of the Hash Houses and it's really not a bad price. The service is good and the portions are enormous. That's what they're known for. My favorite part about Hash House is their biscuits and jam. Honey's good too. I can never seem to get enough. I always think about just ordering a biscuit as my meal, it's filling enough. 

Definitely a good alternative for a meal that's relatively budget conscious on the strip."
2193,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place rocks! One thing I noticed though was you get completely enveloped by the size that in a way the food is not that amazing.

tweet about this place and you get a free drink of the day"
2194,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Being a chicken & waffle connoisseur, it was a given that we were going to partake of Hash House's fare. And after perusing their menu, the mouth-watering descriptions of their food certainly fired up my imagination. I could barely wait to see what exactly they would serve up. We showed up to the Quad, and saw the line was already building even at the early hour we arrived. We were quoted a 40 minute wait, and waited exactly that long.

We were seated quickly, and our server was friendly. I ordered the chicken & waffles, and she ordered the fried chicken benedict. For some reason, our server warned us saying it would take upwards of 30 minutes to produce my dish. Not sure why -- she said it was busy. But come on -- it's fried chicken. Doesn't take that long to cook, and if a freaking Vegas restaurant that specializes in the stuff doesn't have it dropping in the fryer every minute, well shoot. 

Thirty minutes pass, and our server produces two massively towering plates of food. Four waffles (with bacon in between), two chicken breasts, stabbed with a knife to hold it all together. Lots of sage garnish (of course, sage-fried chicken and all). It looked impressive. Unfortunately, the impressions ended there. Mediocre waffles -- even the bacon couldn't save them. Even more mediocre chicken -- flavorful and seasoned, for sure, but undercooked. Not raw undercooked, but rather, the breading was still doughy and not fully crisp. It was fine and all, but considering I paid $20 freaking dollars for it, totally underwhelming. I spent the entire time looking on at her dish, which looked and tasted considerably better than mine.

If you're a fan of Roscoe's and the like, don't expect the same here. It's all glamor and glitz, and no substance at all. If the dish were half the size and minus all the garnish, it could've actually been decent. Even more so if it didn't take so freaking long to serve. If you like long waits, high prices, and deeply mediocre southern-style grub, then sure, come on down."
2195,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Was here 3/7/12

It was awesome!  My wife had the Chicken and Waffles.  Chicken and Waffles def took the blue ribbon!  Waay better than Roscoes.  The waitress was AMAZING!!  I wish I remembered her name, young white girl with dark slick hair, calls you ""Hun"".  She treated us like Royalty.  She is a perfect example of how a waiter should treat their customers.  If I had the money I would have tipped her $100.  They accepted our discount ""Bite Card"" and took off 25% from our bill.  The Kiwi Pomegranete lemonade the waiter recommended was pretty awesome!  I would def come back again."
2196,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wait time is the only reason for the one less star and the waitress wasn't the best.. But the food portions are HUGE and taste very well seasoned. I like the themes of the place and it seems very well ran. Good food, just try and go on a slow time (if there is one) lol"
2197,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of the best places to eat in all of Las Vegas in terms of everything from food to service to price. Huge serving that can feed anyone for a price that could be doubled and style worth it. And the staff was very friendly and welcoming, an all around good atmosphere to enjoy a good meal. The whole menu looks amazing and the biscuits and gravy were just delicious."
2198,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Upstairs at Imperial Palace, the digs aren't quite as funky (in a good way) as the location on Sahara, but the food is great.  Sage Fried  Cicken Benedict starts with a fluffy biscuit then layers on mashed potatoes, fried eggs, bacon, and sage fried chicken and then tops it all off with chipotle sauce for an outstanding meal that, in this case, served three easily when accompanied by a banana brown sugar pancake that was at least 12 inches in diameter.  But first things first... Start the meal with one of their famous and fabulous bloody Marys or a house tangerine mimosa to get off on the right foot.  This is a great place for an unusual breakfast or brunch.  Beware!  All meal portions are huge."
2199,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Fun food. Be prepared for a big meal, splitting is extra (or was the last time we eat there). The vibe is laid back, sort of an upscale Denny's but with better food."
2200,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Read some reviews for a good breadkfast place to eat. Came across this place and wanted to try it. Came here yesterday, Sunday around 12pm. Very packed. Sign that it's the place to be... Ordered a Bloody Mary while we waited.. Spicy but delicious! Food was good. I had the famous Bacon Waffles & Sage Fried Chicken. It was amazing! The presentation was the best part They stack your waffles & stack your chicken on top with a knife thru it.. Outstanding service as well. Can't wait to go back and try other stuff :)"
2201,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Bottom Line:  It's PACKED  - on a Monday at 11:30 am! If you can find a spot at the bar - check it out!

So..... there is a HHAGG right near me in Orlando.  I just finished begging my nephew and/or son to go with me and both let me down.
Then 3 days later ....I'm in Vegas with some of my Flight Attendant friends and one of them says she is on her way to HHAGG!  YOU KNOW I invited myself!
I couldn't believe the line - people were everywhere waiting to be seated.
My friend had been there a week before and sat at the bar.  She said it was perfect and there was this great guy behind the bar named Gary.
It's my triple Lucky Day!  I find someone to go to HHAGG with, there are 2 seats opening up at the bar just as we walk up AND Gary is behind the bar!
There was 4 of us and incredibly enough 2 more seats opened up and one lady was nice enough to move over so we could all fit.
Gary recognized my friend right away (OK - she's one of those that no guy would forget - I guess that makes my day 4x Lucky!) and we are on our way to a great morning.  Gary made a few drink suggestions and I wound up with the Watermelon drink.  I'm not going to post a pic because there are already plenty of pics.  Let's just say it hit the spot.  One friend had a Bloody Mary that was perfectly spiced and another friend had a Pineapple concoction that was delicious - not too sweet either.
We only had 2 food orders, I had the basic breakfast of bacon, eggs, hash browns and a biscuit.  The biscuit satisfied every carb craving I had.  And Gary brought out a homemade jam that was the perfect topping.
My friend had the waffle with eggs and bacon.  Gary noticed right away that the waffle was just a tinge overcooked and asked her if she preferred it lighter.  She said yes and he had a new one in front of her in a blink of an eye. Great Customer Service. It's always nice to have someone that is watching out for you when you are spending money.  Gary was very busy - running behind that bar and getting drinks for the restaurant as well but we never felt like we had to flag him down or hope to get his attention.  He was on top of things!
My breakfast was only $11 which I thought was very reasonable - especially considering the size of that biscuit.  Plus I had cantaloupe and an orange slice on my plate.  I was stuffed!


Would I go back?  Well, I'm turning right back around and doing the same trip - so I'll take my chances and check it out and see if there is a spot open at the bar - and hopefully Gary will be there again.  If not - I will make a plan to go to the one in Orlando and hopefully get an order of that Chicken and Waffles I keep ogling!!"
2202,Hash House A Go Go,5,"SHARE SHARE SHARE! All the dishes are HUGE! One dish was plenty for the two of us & we have enough leftovers for lunch. Andrew D was nice & provided quick service. To go boxes are shabby, broke as we were putting leftovers into the box at the table."
2203,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Place has the weirdest foods which makes it harder to order something DECENT. And the lady that calls up the party's for their table is one of those very rude employees that scream in a rude tone. And on the way out I within a couple feet and she screamed ""mike party for 5"" and I almost went deaf. And floor is oldish and weird decor."
2204,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Loved this place! The portions are huge and the boyfriend and I don't always like the same foods. Needless to say, we had a lot of food left over but it was sooooo good. I had the famous sage fried chicken and bacon waffles and he had the garlic chicken and avocado hash. Both were amazing! Service was great and fast too. Will def come again on the next visit."
2205,Hash House A Go Go,4,Walked about 15-20 mins down the strip to try something new this time. The food was worth the walk. Everything came out nicely prepared on the plates and cooked great. Props to the chef. My only bad thing would be that it was crazy busy and took a while to get our food out. We'll come back next time and give it another try.
2206,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The rosemary fried chicken and waffles. Omg. It's tasty. It's HUGE. Nobody finishes it in one sitting (read: share). The sage and rosemary flavor is delish!

I've been to Hash House a Go Go in both SD and Vegas and both are great. 

Man vs Food has been here. The meals are all too big to finish, so either plan on boxing up and eating it at 4am when you're done with partying, or just order 1 entree per 2 people. But get the fried chicken waffle."
2207,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It really is as good as it gets. Amazing food...tons of it, too....chicken and waffles....I just can't even describe....the chicken was moist and delicious and full of flavor...the waffles actually are cooked with bacon in them...i could only eat so much, but it was worth it...we lucked out and didn't have to wait, but on the weekends...expect to wait...it is so worth it. Our waitress was so nice and energetic. I wish I would have gotten her name. Just a great experience all the way around!"
2208,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great place for breakfast. The portion size are huge. I recommend sharing. The wait is a little long, but definitely worth it."
2209,Hash House A Go Go,5,Omg this place is BOMB!!! I was hungover (of course it's Vegas lol). I had The BEST Bloody Mary EVER! I also got the fried chicken Benedict and it was AMAZING. It's a MUST when in Vegas.
2210,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My husband and I heard rumors that a Hash House a Go Go was put inside of the Imperial Palace and were eager to try it out. We liked it but would definitely share portions next time. This was a little insane, even when you're hungry! 

The biscuits are a sure thing. Go for it.

Read our blog for pictures if you want."
2211,Hash House A Go Go,5,Stumbled upon this restaurant twice - once on Fremont for breakfast & once on the Strip for dinner. Both times simply amazing. The scrambled eggs were packed with ingredients & biscuit with jam all homemade. The dinner had massive proportions & just amazing flavor - from the burger to crab cake to pot pie & Mac & cheese. Bloody Mary was very tasty. Server Nelson went way above & beyond. Only thing I would change is that it was cold in the restaurant. We will be back. Simply some of the best food with amazing prices.
2212,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food! Big plates and did i say Amazing.ya its real good.I had the Stuffed Meatloaf OMG the best...We ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning..We as in my boyfriend and I..The plates are huge..He had the Sage fried chicken with Pasta and Green Beans.Btw we still had his leftovers couldnt eat that had to save for later..think the kids ate it..The honey bisquits are amazing but we only ate the top..i know but the sweet honey flavor was so good.So we shared as we usually do.That way we get to try more than one item..Otherwise seriously we could have just shared a plate noone needs to eat an entire plate of food here...Its just so much..I loved it.Cant wait to come again..Next time breakfast and Im having the Bacon stuffed Waffles and Sage chicken...HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE....Thankyou P.J.  you were a good server , there when we needed you and not bugging us when we didnt, loved that you warned us about the large plates..Thankyou......I fricken love your food..The only bad thing..It was so damn hot in there.....Will definately return hopefully you get your own air conditioning or fans ..lol"
2213,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The line was an hour long but we got called a bit sooner. The food came out within 10 minutes and the portion was amazingly hugeeee. We ordered the chicken and waffle, chicken pot, Andy's fried chicken, the potatoes and chorizo dish. The chicken was boned in so I like that touch. But overall, the dish was a little bit dry and lacked some flavor. The waffle were just normal waffles., nothing special, the chorizo and potatoes were good and I enjoyed the spicyness. The chicken pot pie was not good in my opionion. I would not come back, considering the wait and the food quality, there's much better food options in Vegas."
2214,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is the best restaurant in Vegas for breakfast!  If you don't get there early you'll have to wait, but the food is definitely worth it!!!  Loved the pancake and next time want to come back for lunch and try their burgers.  Saw the people next to us eating them and they are HUGE and look amazing!"
2215,Hash House A Go Go,5,Very very good! It was plenty of food so either come hungry or share! Service was awesome. Thank you for a great meal in Vegas
2216,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My new favorite breakfast place.  Had the corned beef hash, the kids got the waffles with bacon in the middle.  The yummiest part was the espresso with a scoop of ice-cream.  Love it here, a good treat once in a while!"
2217,Hash House A Go Go,1,Zero star not worth the 2 hour wait. The service was really poor. I made eye contact so many times because the food took so long about 30 mins. The chicken and waffles were really floury. This place is overrated. They advertise with yelp. Why would a good restaurant pay for yelp?
2218,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We have a HHAGG in San Diego, but we were starving and didn't want to tear ourselves away from the black jack tables. We split a corn beef hash with poached eggs and the snickers pancake. The pancake was humongous! we couldn't even eat a quarter of it after devouring the cornbeef hash. Everything was good. Service was a little slow- it took 15 minutes to get our check. This is probably the best part of the IP."
2219,Hash House A Go Go,5,"great food great presentation very big serving you can divide it with 2 or 3 people my family keeps on coming back to this restaurant, plus it's open 24/7!"
2220,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food here is amazing. The wait staff left a little to be desired though. They were very slow and mixed up my tables order a few times. They were quick to try to correct all issues. I recommend you come hungry ad the plates are huge but delicious. Also there is usually a 30-45 minute wait for a table do be prepared.
2221,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is great for breakfast and you get plenty of food! I had the chicken & waffles and really enjoyed it.
2222,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're starving RIGHT NOW, this is a bad choice. I waited for an hour and a half on a Wednesday morning around 10:40. I eventually gave up & went to the bar with another server's help- he saw I was waiting for forever & scouted me a seat. That was nice. 

The Corned Beef hash was pretty darn good with an egg over easy. I recommend ordering a side of the chipotle cream sauce to dip or drizzle on to this yum-o skillet. The biscuit is heavenly with the daily fresh made strawberry preserves. 

From the time I was seated, it took 35 minutes to receive my food. That provided me tons of time to check out the fast paced employees running amuk to do their jobs. Next time, I'm getting a pancake for sure. Those looked incredible. 

Worth the visit!"
2223,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Pro: AMAZING FOOD

Con: SLOW SERVICE, HORRIBLE LONG WAIT! 

Me and my friend shared the infamous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict shown from Man vs. Food.  and omg... it was AMAZING!!! Soo delicious, it had chicken, bacon, spinach, biscuits, eggs, and this deliciouss sauce all meshed into one bite of awesomenesssss.  The portion was big enough for us to share, but we had to buy a side dish or he would've charged us more to share since the portions are so massive at this place.  

The ONLY bad thing about this place (which is a pretty bad thing that I knocked it down 2 stars), was the wait. Holy moly.  We waited like 45 minutes for us to get seats.  When we finally got called, the restaurant was EMPTY!! Wtf.  Why were we waiting that long for a place that isn't even busy?! THEN, we waited another 45 minutes for the food! Keep in mind, we came here at 2pm, partied out all night the night before, and haven't even anything since before we partied! At 3:30pm, my friend was so hungry she ate a spoon of ketchup LOL.  They didn't even let us order appetizers ""because they don't do appetizers.""  -__-  

so yeah.  Delicious food, horrible wait.

Solution?

Try Hash House somewhere else.  NOT the strip. You don't want to waste all your vacation time in Vegas with these lazy slow servers."
2224,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Unbelievably delicious.
So convenient for our crew too because we stayed in The Quad for our Vegas trip, AND Hash House is open 24 hours!! The wait was a little long for us (but we were also a party of 12) but it was worth it. 

I ordered the ham, spinach and cheddar scramble. Now if you like omelets, the scramble is the way to go. It was delicious! SUCH HUGE PORTIONS TOO!!! *see picture below* 

It is definitely a good amount of food for the price you pay. I was also told the chicken and waffles was insanely good too."
2225,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food here tasted great!  Large portions, but tasty.  If it weren't for the long wait, we'd probably never venture in here.  But my aunt was able to get us in here, w/a reasonable wait time and we weren't disappointed w/the food.  Had the sage chicken and waffles which had bacon in the waffles.  Super tasty.  The chocolate chip pancakes was surprisingly good and I'm not a pancake person. Customer service was top-notch as well.  I'd love to be back here!"
2226,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Went with my man for a late night meal. Maybe we ordered the wrong pancake. Yeah, I am pretty sure, I ordered the wrong pancake since my man tried the Pumpkin one a couple of years ago and really loved it. OY VEY!

He ordered a basic breakfast meal, which included 2 eggs and a CHOICE (yeah, not multiple) of sausage, ham, bacon, or potatoes, plus a Flapjack. Usually places include potatoes because they are ridiculously cheap to produce. Tsk, tsk HH (which I kept thinking meant Happy Hour). 

My man ordered 2 medium eggs and potatoes and I choose the Banana and Brown Sugar Flapjack because I thought that ""flavor"" sounded good-WRONG! To add insult to injury, they charged +$1 for this flavored pancake, ugh. 

The decor is country chic, meaning they have elegant cow-hide chairs they were trying to preserve by seating everyone in the plain Jane black leather seating to the right of the entrance. 

The pancake was a monstrosity. Maybe a 10"" diameter, not sure, but it was ginormous and not a very pretty pancake. I did not like the brown sugar, which caused one side to form a weird crust. Then part of the banana tasted artificial. That is a no-no Hash House A Go Go, a huge NO NO! My man said the small portion of potatoes and eggs were decent. 

At around $16, I still felt kind of ripped off, but at least we were stuffed. Tip, do not order the Banana and Brown Sugar Flapjack, it will not please you.   

HH, you should really prohibit smoking in the restaurant, it felt barbaric smelling smoke and I loathed eating in a smoked filled room. People, it is rude for anyone to light up in a restaurant (some people have no home training), we are not at your house."
2227,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Heard so much about this place!  Everytime people come here I see beautiful plated food w/ HUGE portions.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  Very pretty, stacked high.   Waffles had bacon and chives in it.  Personally, I felt the waffles tasted too much of chives.  The batter for waffles wasn't crispy and lacked something, wasted sure what.  Fried chicken was hot, moist, and crispy.  It's enough for probably two people.  Next time, I'll be coming here to try the desserts!"
2228,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go at the Imperial Palace.  I had a $25.00 certificate from restaurant.com. (dinner).  Went about 5:30pm since we were starving, hardly anyone in the place.  Interesting dÃ©cor with a lot of aluminum, including the tables.  Had the BEST waitress.  Hubby had the 1 pound stuffed burger (roasted peppers & mozzarella), BFF the Blue Crab (with linguine) appetizer (meal sized) and I had the stuffed meatloaf (roasted peppers, fresh spinach, mozzarella).  Drinks were just iced tea.  The food was wonderful and of course WAY, WAY too much of it.  HH adds the 18% tip on the bill when using the certificates, the whole bill came to $34.20 - what a deal!  5 stars

This location at the Imperial Palace menu is not quite the same as on HH's website.  For a true menu, look at the one posted for HH on restaurant.com"
2229,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Twisted farm food is right. 

This place is so TWISTED! We showed up on New Years Day, and I'm sure they were running low on staff. Still.

The Rose Bowl was on and they couldn't switch the TV from Judge Judy for the entire breakfast because nobody knew how...(?)

We asked them to split the bill ($150 total), and they swiped 2 cards for $114 each.

Skip the BLT Bloody Mary--it's basically a glorified Bloody Mary with Wonder Bread and limp, pre-cooked piece of bacon."
2230,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place has HUGE portions. Most dishes could be shared by 2 people. I ordered the House Favorite Scramble with salmon. It was pretty good. My friend didn't like hers at all. The waiter replaced it with crispy potatoes with no charge for the Scramble. My mimosa was warm. I was with a big party, but the waiter made us feel rushed. If I travel back to Vegas, I probably wouldn't go back unless I was extremely hungry."
2231,Hash House A Go Go,5,The wait was long but WORTH IT!! I had the kiwi watermelon lemonade and it was amazing. I also had the roast chicken hash and it was to die for. I would go back and wait again because that meal was absolutely wonderful. Oh and despite the wait the servers were just awesome.
2232,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait was not bad for Las Vegas.  20 minutes for party of 2. Order the BLT Bloody Mary, spicy and amazing.  Entree was Bacon waffles and they too were amazing.  The service was great. Maria was our server and we never had an empty glass. The pricing was GREAT for breakfast in Las Vegas. We stop here again on next trip to Nevada.  Very satisfied! !!!"
2233,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Good food.  Huge portions but split the food. Music is to loud.
We were with another couple & they received their food first. We had to wait 20 minutes for our food."
2234,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My girlfriend and I just recently visited this place multiple times over our week-long stay at the Quad Hotel and it hit the mark every time.  Pretty much everything you could realistically want form a solid breakfast/brunch heavy place.  It's fantastic that they serve a certain amount (quite a lot actually) of their breakfast menu all day, and that they are available in the hotel as the room service option.  In addition to the great food, the portions are insanely generous creating a great value for the customer.  Finally, our server, Krystie, was pretty fantastic the whole time and took great care of us...I highly recommend getting sat in her section!"
2235,Hash House A Go Go,3,"restaurant is the least fav location as its so dark and depressing. The service was ok, long wait as its on the strip. The food was average, big quantities of average food. I've had a better experience at their other location"
2236,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge tasty good food!  
Get there early, there is always a wait."
2237,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was one of my favorite places to eat and drink on the strip. We first stopped by for breakfast, the wait was 25 minutes which is a bit long but understandable for a popular restaurant. We put our name in and went down to the casino to gamble a bit. We came back and we're sat within minutes. Our server Alonzo was helpful with directing us through the menu because I was very indecisive. I wish he warned us about portion size, had we know how big the plates were, we would have split an order. We went from starving to uncomfortable full with less than half the plate eaten.
We also came back at 2 am because the place is 24hours. We ordered this particular bartenders signature margaritas and were not disappointed. The drink was made well and made this light-weight pretty drunk."
2238,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is fantastic. Big portions that you can share. The wait wasn't too long-maybe about 15 min when we got there at 11ish. Then we waited for about 20-25 min for our food. They make everything fresh. We ordered the sage chicken and waffle and the tractor combo. The sage chicken and waffle- chicken was made perfect, flavorful and very crispy, the waffle was a bacon waffle - it was alright. Didn't care for it.
Will definitely come back again and this place is 24hrs"
2239,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our last day in Vegas...so we needed a great farewell meal. We found it here. Below I listed everything we ordered...all of it comes highly recommended.

Service was also fabulous! And the prices were very reasonable, especially since the meals are HUGE!

*I went with the BBBLT sandwich. One word...BACON! I loved this sandwich...fabulous bread too. 
*My boyfriend decided on the Chicken and waffles. It was literally a stack of fried chicken breasts and waffles (which had bacon baked into them). Yum!
*The Tractor Driver Combo - this comes with 2 eggs with bacon or sausage. You also get either one pancake, waffle or french toast. The person I was with went with the fren ch toast (she added brown sugar bananas on top). She was VERY happy!
*BLT Bloody Mary. This is basically a normal, spicy BM, but it comes with a few slices of bacon inside, a thick slice of tomato and a piece of buttered toast on the side. 

Note...this place is very popular, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 during normal breakfast/brunch times. It's worth the wait though.

Overall...if you're looking for a breakfast/brunch/lunch joint to knock your socks off...here you go!"
2240,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very taste. Huge portions. The bacon waffles were amazing and hit the spot. The sage chicken was a little weird. The chicken itself was bland, but the fried skin had a strong sage flavor. I'm sure a lot of people like that, but it wasn't for me."
2241,Hash House A Go Go,2,"My experience wasn't the best we went in to get take out and I ordered the chicken and waffles which I heard so much about and was excited to finally try it.....  I made the take out order and said numerous times I don't want Bacon in the waffles because I don't eat Bacon so we get back to the Villa and I'm ready to grub heated up the food and everything and something told me to flip the waffles over and long and behold Bacon I was so pissed cause once my food order is wrong my whole eating experience is ruined.. But I did eat the chicken and they give u 2 nice big pieces and it taste good too bad I didn't get the whole chicken & waffle experience though.... 

P.s. it wasn't the bartender who took the order fault that Bacon was in the waffle because he put it on the order even said it was on receipt but I guess someone in the kitchen was being fast and didn't read the order"
2242,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Go here! I ordered the salmon omelet and my buddy ordered the red velvet waffle. Both were excellent. We stuck with water since we didn't want to pay for drinks, but their drink menu looked good. The biscuit that came with the omelet was HUGE! The portions here are big and tasty. I'd definitely come back"
2243,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We love hash house!! We have been to the one in sand Diego so it's already our favorite so we were very happy to see they have one in vegas! The portions are still big but the food is smaller then the one in San Diego! Not that we eat more just something we noticed! 
What we did love about this place is that it's open 24/7 so there wasn't a wait to be seated and it wasn't crowded so we were able to get served quickly!"
2244,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ok, the douche-bag next to me complained about the 20mn delay before receiving his breakfast... Ok, the nice lady on my right started to wonder if she will get hers at some point during the day... In spite of this bad karma, I decided to give it a try and ordered a basic breakfast. There were two waitresses. One was stressed out because of the douche-bag's attitude, the other was handling business in a kind of too relaxed way. In any case, both were friendly and professionals! When my plate arrived, I was agreeably surprised by the generous portions and the awesome presentation. Each bite was a pure delight. Certainly one of the best breakfasts I have had in Vegas! So why not 5 stars? Only because of the delay (for me over 15mn). I will definitely come back though!"
2245,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We had a wait as it was busy. But also had a time frame since we had to be somewhere later. The initial host was very polite, although I was getting a bit tense given our time frame.

He then was shifted to sitting people and another young lady replaced him. Now I am not sure who made this decision, but when you have contact with the public, someone with people skills who does not have a chip on their shoulder is generally a good idea.

She was terrible. Rude, and did not care about the concern of the customers (who by the way pay the bills). 

Once we were seated, the food was good, waitress very good and the original host was very good too.

The hostess though ruined it for me and as a group, we steered clear of the restaurant."
2246,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious!! I loved this place. I was recommended by my manager and I was not disappointed at all. Service was great, wait time was amazing, and the food WOW. We ordered the sage chicken so delicious. It had a great amount of spice. Huge portion, my boyfriend and I shared it and there was still left overs."
2247,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing place if you are looking for a cheap breakfast that fills you up! Portions are nothing short of HUGE. Staff is very courteous. I will be going back on my trips to Las Vegas.
2248,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We came here because man v food was loving it and so were my friends. 
I want my money back. 

The server was nice. The biscuits are delicious but that's where it ends. 

I ordered the basic breakfast. Simple right? Nope. I wanted cheese on my eggs and I asked for biscuit rather than toast. I got Cold eggs with no cheese and got wheat toast instead of the biscuit I had asked for. I wanted to get it re-done but the server never came back! I ate maybe 1/3 of my ""obese lady special plate"", the thing was freaking huge. 
My boyfriend's dish was runny and he couldn't eat the eggs.
I paid 30 bucks for pure crap. I really would have had a better meal at mcdonalds. 
If you're a fat bastard who likes cold plates, messed up orders and no service, by all means, the hash house is your palace."
2249,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Only negative I have was waiting because I've been wanting to eat at a Hash Has A Go Go for years! There was a long list of people waiting but the wait was not long (15 minutes). I was surprised when I went inside how large the restaurant actually is. My girl and I shared our food. Here's what we got: Snickers pancake, vanilla waffle with a side of over easy eggs and seasoned potatoes. The Snickers pancake was awesome. It had A LOT of Snickers pieces baked in! The over easy eggs were well made and the potatoes were very good. The vanilla waffle was also really good. Would definitely go back!"
2250,Hash House A Go Go,1,"What a terrible experience! Let me start with the food and make this a short -lived  misery. 
They are famous for the Chicken and bacon waffle tower. It looks impressive and that's all!!!!! The chicken breast was moist, but bland. The breading crusting the chicken was so hard it was inedible. The best thing was the bacon slices in the waffle- that was the highlight of this place. 
The mimosa was orange juice and zero bubbly! Pay extra for nothing.
We waited for over an hour to receive our food and they still forgot to bring one meal out and forgot two drinks?! 
This place is highly overrated with subpar food! 
Totally underwhelmed! 
If there was a zero star, that's what they would be getting.  This location is inside the Linq and service to start with was awful.  We were 8 ladies going for brunch, one had to dip out to the restroom and that's when they called us up, but since all 8 of us were not there they wouldn't seat us, this was after an hour wait - and they did Not tell us this ahead of time! Needless to say the atmosphere was cold as ice and everything else just went downhill! We could have gone to McDonalds and received better service and food. 
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME going here!"
2251,Hash House A Go Go,5,The bloody Mary's are off the chain. Everything is huge from the resteraunt. So b prepared for large portions. So good! You can't go wrong here
2252,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yum! So good! It's a good thing that you have to walk a lot on The Strip or else it's easy to gain 10 lbs. from this place!
2253,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Soooo I really wanted to go here for breakfast. I drooled over photos on yelp before my trip and bookmarked it.  However, we ended up here in the evening at about 9 pm, so they didn't have their breakfast in full force. They had some, but not anything I was especially interested in. The whole menu is centered on gluttony, and I am a fat kid at heart, so I was in my element. However, I had already eaten 3 donuts that day in addition to a buffet and many many drinks, so I didn't want to go overboard and ended up ordering a chicken breast thing. My bf ordered some kind of corned beef sandwich. 

Food took FOREVER and we were starving. When the food came out, my chicken breasts were on bones (ewwww, I can't handle meat on a bone) so I switched back into gluttony mode and asked if I could order a burger instead. Server was very quick to whisk away the boned food and my burger came out fast. It was a FULL POUND LUCY STUFFED BURGER with mozzarella and red peppers inside.  Sounds amazing, right?! It was just okay. The burger was actually very bland and I had to put a bunch of salt and pepper on it. I got it with a salad to redeem myself a little bit. They also gave me fries too. Fries were okay. Salad was fine. I did manage to eat almost the whole burger. I would have definitely liked to come back for breakfast and plan to if I am ever back.

TIP: There's no cell service, and the wifi sucked."
2254,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place for breakfast, brunch, lunch; one order will cover all meals.
BIG portions, shareable, good price for big entrees.
I hardly drink iced tea, their combo tea/lemonade is perfect hardly sweet.
Need to come in early for breakfast, waiting time is at least an hour, so don't go HANGRY cuz you have to wait.
Great servers, very helpful and pleasant."
2255,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My friends and I ate here while in Vegas for my bachelorette. UH-MA-ZING!!!! We ordered a few entrees to share, but it was the chicken fried steak that really hit the spot. It had a chipotle gravy on it that was out of this world!!!!! Our whole experience from start to finish was wonderful. Drinks and food arrived quickly and service was great. I cannot wait to return!!!!"
2256,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A definite to go to! This place has both the flavor and big portions! (Depending on what you order) The wait is long but hey it's Vegas. The smaller your group is, the faster you get in. Good customer service. 

If you don't know what to get, try the Texas Ranchero or the Chicken & Waffles. 

Definitely recommend."
2257,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The formula: Pack all the fat, grease, carbs, bacon you can on a plate, then give humongous portions, then be featured on a travel show, then people will flock there.
I fell for it. I wish I hadn't. 
I ordered the fried chicken eggs benedict. They stay true to the fat/grease/carbs/bacon formula. This behemoth has a bed of grilled mashed potatoes topped with dry biscuits, layered with the slimiest, uncrispiest bacon, topped with flavorless fried chicken, then finally over-sauced with a bland chipotle cream sauce. 
As you can tell from my description. I hated this dish. That is putting it mildly. This dish has never heard of contrasting textures. This dish has one texture, which is MUSH. Everything is mushy and dry. The bacon might've been crisp before, but when sandwiched between biscuit and chicken it just got slimy. It was almost the texture of raw bacon. You want the crunch of fried chicken? Not here. The Chicken is just over smothered in the chipotle sauce and just makes the breading soft and mushy. 
The portion was huge. Don't even think about taking the rest to your hotel room unless you have a fridge. This thing spoils with a quickness. I got hungry and desperate later on the day, then I took one spoiled bite...that was it for my foodie vacation. I couldn't eat for 5 days. Not Hash house's fault I decided to eat spoiled food, but what do they expect you to do with their mammoth portions that spoil too quickly.
The service was bad. I am a Vegas early bird so I ate alone. They sat me at the counter. They said the bartender would take my order. I tried to order, but he ignored me and went in the kitchen to make someone's fancy barista coffee. That took 10 minutes. I tapped my fingers on the table and finally a waitress decided to take my order. Also, at the counter was a display of all the front-of-the-house problems and arguments for all to see. I could not relax with all their bickering, eye-rolling, and hustle and bustle. I don't think anyone liked each other. I don't think anyone liked working there. If you are dining solo, never ever let them sit you at the bar.
Bad Mushy food. Bad service. In this round of Man vs. Food...EVERYONE LOST."
2258,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, which was highly recommended here on Yelp and was featured on Man vs. Food and boy it did not fail to deliver! Soo delicious - wish I could have eaten it all, but sadly there was just so much food and there was no fridge or microwave in our hotel. :( The giant serving comes with a huge piece of fried chicken breast with egg, tomato, bacon, spinach, and mashed potatoes all topped with a slightly spicy house bechamel sauce. If you get it to go, the sauce comes on the side, which is a nice touch and allowed me to adjust the amount of sauce I wanted (so you might want to ask for it on the side as well judging by how much sauce comes on it otherwise). The only thing I wish was that sage flavor on the chicken came through a little more. Not too pricey given the portion size. I came here around 7 am on a Saturday so it was not very full (there were maybe 4 parties are so sitting). My take out order came out in less than 10 minutes, which was certainly impressive. The restaurant is pretty small overall though so I can see how it gets insanely packed. My advice, come early. You won't regret it."
2259,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here 2 times over the past weekend.  Both times I tried 2 salads.  One was the chicken ceaser & I forget what the other one was called. Both salads were GREAT.  Served in very large bowl like plate w/ a big homemade biscuit.  The biscuit was soft and tasted very good. The salad dressing to both salads tasted very unique, different than the usual run of the mill salad dressings.  It was not that expensive for two lunches/brunch and a drink, under $50.  The alcoholic drinks left a little to be desired.  I had a pink lemonade margarita.  It tasted sweet, sort of watered down.  Not that great & it took too long to get our drinks when the place wasn't full at the time me & my husband went. The food came almost at the same time as the drinks even thou we had ordered the drinks first. In my opinion they need to get more experienced, seasoned bartenders.  From what I saw they have young girls making drinks that don't look that serious about how to make a good drink. Seems they rather chit chat with their fellow servers then learn to make a good drink.  If the place wants eye candy as their bartenders, they should train them right. Otherwise I think this place was great."
2260,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was recommended by a coworker and a friend... it did not disappoint!!!   

Food portions are HUGE but, more importantly, the TASTE was amazing!   The pricing is not bad at all especially, for Vegas.  Most meals and sandwiches, ranged between $12 - $20.  

I would definitely go again!"
2261,Hash House A Go Go,5,Delicious!!!!! We had chicken with asparagus and the scrambled eggs are amazing!!!! Hot chocolate with marshmallows all that for $30 great food great price the wait time we use in the casino to play crabs:)
2262,Hash House A Go Go,5,"YUM!  A little tricky to find, but well worth it.  There was a 5 minute wait at 7AM on a Sunday, not bad!  We were seated with courtesy, and handed a menu with plenty of options.  I had the salmon scramble, which was great.  My family split the pancakes and French toast which were off the charts as well.  I will say, the server gave us no guidance on portion sizes and allowed us to order food for twice as many people as in our party, which was disappointing.  At $62 for breakfast, it was pricey, but it is Vegas after all.  No more $0.99 buffets in this town."
2263,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is awesome! Chicken and waffles! Yummy!!! PJ is awesome! Will be back next time!
2264,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We went to sahara location in this morning.( Andy T, Jieun L, Oliver, Nino and myself) Menu has lots of variety.
Yes portion was HUGE, but taste was so so.
The service was good. New Trainer did good job. He checked us oftenly and asked refill my coffee from time to time.
Their one of drink Lomonade Mimosa was pretty good.
I ordered The Tractor Driver Combo. I got two eggs and bacons, and waffle. I chose Granola waffle and this one was tooooooo chewey.
Even I couldn't cut  well with my knife. So I barely finished 4/1 peice.
I poured syrup on top of waffle but it dosn't work well.
I made to go for that leftover waffle.I guess I'm not going to finish left over. It will be more chewey tommorrow."
2265,Hash House A Go Go,5,"By far the best money on food during our Vegas trip. We had a great time enjoying some amazing flavors and enough food left over to cover us for dinner time later in the day. We enjoyed the meal that Adam Savage devoured on Man vs Food, the adam sage. This was fantastically paired with a massive banana walnut pancake. This satisfied our hunger and need for a sweet and savory combo. Great service throughout! We are definitely coming back here in the future!"
2266,Hash House A Go Go,4,Cool breakfast spot in LINQ hotel. Prices weren't too bad and the wait time for a table for fairly short. Food portion was HUGE and the prices were average.
2267,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had the Sage Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, that's it. Reviews over. This meal is to breakfast and my Yelp review what Mike Tyson was to boxing. 12 seconds. First round. Over. Or-der it. 

Try it or Diet Final Word

""Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the mouth."" --Mike Tyson"
2268,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge portions, not enough flavor.  This ""Man v Food"" is really tempting my husband to go to all these places, even when I say it doesn't even look good, we still go!

Waited 20 minutes for a table, the host greeted us, he was very polite.  Our waitress seemed high energy.  I start with a latte, they don't have nonfat milk just so you know, it was alright.  I ordered the salmon hash.  I do ask the crazy questions before ordering like substituting whites for full eggs, no cheese etc.  I've turned to a calorie counter so this is important.  He orders the Fried chicken benedict, no substitutions, as is.  Thirty minutes later, two people have to bring out our food because the benedict requires to hands, one for the plate and one to support the benedict so it doesn't fall down.  The benedict consisted of a split chicken breast fried, 2 biscuits split in half, at least a pound of mashed potatoes, fried cheese, spinach, tomatoes topped with a hollandaise sauce.  He ordered with the pistachio mocha which tasted like hersheys chocolate and pistachio extract, I would pass on that drink and it cost about $6.
So the benedict, he ended up picking out the chicken and some potatoes and the spinach, the rest was just too mediocre.  It could feed at least 4 people.

My meal, which cost extra mind you because of my substitutions didn't come out right, they had to have been a half pound of brie cheese, though I said no cheese.  The waitress did ask if I wanted a new one, but I was disappointed with the flavors anyways, why wait another half hour?  So the waitstaff is a 5, but the food is pushing a 2/3.  Not very cheap.  And I still had to pay for my meal with the substitutions. With it being in Vegas, I would try another place."
2269,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Forget the hash, you HAVE TO try the burgers. Oh my. We split a burger with cheese, avocado, and some other yummy stuff. Huge, with lots of flavor. And great fries. It was definitely one of the best burgers ever and you really can feed two people on one burger."
2270,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash Hash came recommended in addition to catching my eye from all the reviews.  All I can say is go here!  Do not miss the opportunity to have breakfast, lunch, or Dinner at this place.  My wife and I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and damn it is plenty of food to split!  The freaking waffles come stuffed with bacon too!  We loved our experience and will come back again."
2271,Hash House A Go Go,3,Overrated. What really ruined the meal was the sage - they use it as a garnish.  Weird choice as sage has a super strong taste and overpowers the meal.  Saving grace was the Bloody Mary. Fantastic drink. Service was also very good. But doesn't make up for the lackluster food.
2272,Hash House A Go Go,5,i think i could eat here everyday and never get over it. The food is from Heaven and the portions can feed a Lion.  Even the drinks are unique. A+ service also
2273,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Got a small $3 coffee to go. $3 coffee tastes the same as $1 coffee. 

MIGHT come back for food."
2274,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Have to agree with the large portions!

We stopped in at 5:30 pm on a Tuesday and were seated immediately.  By the time we were leaving the people were starting to pack in. We had the Chicken and waffles and the ribs.  Everything was delicious and well presented. If I were getting the chicken and waffles again I would have omitted the bacon in the waffles just so I could get more waffles in.

The bread with dinner service was a huge biscuit smothered in honey. Delicious.  

Service was quick and friendly and we enjoyed our server Kae.

You have to us stairs or escalator for access.  The restrooms are located back on the main casino floor.  The down escalator was out of service.  That could be an issue for those with mobility issues. 

Would return for sure."
2275,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had the vanilla waffle, which was delicious. Warning: biggest, most absurd portion sizes you've ever seen. OJ is overpriced. Scrambled eggs and bacon are average. Go early on a Sunday if you want to avoid the ridiculous line. Also slightly annoying that the restrooms are downstairs. Great service, friendly staff, and casual environment. Go with 2-3 other people to split your meal with!"
2276,Hash House A Go Go,5,Everything here is delicious! The waitstaff was incredibly nice. It is sort of a long wait but I'm not sure what great breakfast places aren't. I would highly suggest the green fried tomatoes!! They are something else.
2277,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First trip to Las Vegas and Hash a go go was on my to go list. This place is really good! I ordered the sage chicken, which was really good and flavorful, it was huge enough to to share with my friend. The sage chicken sits on a bed of mashed potatoes, and a biscuit, topped with melted cheese over bacon. I also ordered the kiwi watermelon spiked lemonade. Which was very refreshing however it tasted like it wasn't spike at all. In fact I believe I got a regulator kiwi watermelon lemonade. Wait time was about 25 minutes for a party of 5. Bathrooms are downstairs, which sucks. Wait Staff is pretty friendly. I will try again when I come back to vegas!"
2278,Hash House A Go Go,4,This was a awesome breakfast place. We ordered the chicken and waffles and it was huge!!!!! It can easily be shared among 3 people! The waffles was infused with bacon which is heaven and the chicken was fried to perfection. Service was decent as well. Wish I can order more dishes but I'm sooooo full from just this one dish!
2279,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash house is the definition of over the top! The food is amazing, the portions are insane, and the value is unbeatable. I had one of their ""favorite"" scrambles (roasted chicken, corn, mozzarella) and it was fantastic. The crispy potatoes are not to be missed. Definitely check out this spot when you are in Vegas."
2280,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Soooo good!!! Big portions!! Staff was great!! 
I read the reviews before I came in and I must say that this place is as good as people say it is."
2281,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is always a must when I'm in town. The food is great, large portions and amazing flavor. I have eaten here several times and never been disappointed. Make reservations though or expect to wait awhile! The old school hot chocolate is my favorite drink! Always friendly and helpful staff. The flapjacks are huge!"
2282,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love me a banana brown sugar flapjack! It is seriously to die for! 

This place is ALWAYS packed so get total rewards platinum/diamond status or just plan on waiting.  It really is worth it!"
2283,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Tried five dishes and the only thing good here were the chicken and waffles. HUGE portions. SUPER CHEAP. 

Service for us was meh. We asked for the entree without meat and they brought it with meat. We told them about their error and they simply scraped off the meat and returned the plate back to use :/ was a little bummed that they did that, but we ate it anyway."
2284,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are HUGE. Better to plan going there to share because you will not be eating anything else the rest of the day if you finish your entire plate. Also, the cocktails are very thoughtful!"
2285,Hash House A Go Go,3,I've been here several times and brought several people here. They give you really large portions but I thought it was some odd combinations that didn't always mix well. I don't like being given so much potatoes that I cannot eat and feel stuffed. It's really just a filler.
2286,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Portions are out of control, but you're in Vegas, go big or go home. 

We always get the chicken and waffles and then we always try something else. This latest time I got the Boston Scramble. I would recommend they put this on the regular menu. Delicious!! 

I would HIGHLY recommend has house to anyone looking for a unique dining experience in Vegas. ;-)"
2287,Hash House A Go Go,4,Love this place. Nothing like a 24hr diner with large portions right on the strip. Bartender was nice and food was amazing. Kitchen was backed up so there was a long wait on food. Only come when you have time to spare.
2288,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Okay I did not actually love what I ordered but I'l take the blame on that one. I knew the food was different and was it ever! Just know that everything seems to come with a boatload of home style mashed potatoes under it! Everything! At first I thought it was a colossal waste of food, but quickly realized you could take the leftovers home and eat for days. So if you're a local (or a visitor with a fridge) and want a down home dining experience at a decent price this is the place for you. The food was good. I am an eggs Benedict fan so if you're looking for traditional this is not the place. My dish was slathered in a reddish orange creamy bell pepper sauce. However the only thing I can't stand are bell peppers. The waitress did tell me. The eggs and the bacon sans sauce were delish though. The mashed potatoes were overkill but cool at the same time. WE HAD THE BEST WAITRESS EVER. My coffee came up right away even before we ordered! She was leaning over all four corners of the booth, out of the blue to refill our cups, excellent service. Again prices were reasonable, especially for Vegas."
2289,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So good! I just recently went to Vegas for the first time ever and Hash House was one of those places that kept popping up when I was doing research. After seeing some of the menu and seeing the reviews I knew I had to go.

I got the chicken and waffles because I just had to. They were amazing. One of the best meals I've ever had. My friend got a banana and brown sugar pancakes that was 2xs the size of her head and loved it.

This place was so good we ended up going twice. We want to go to Vegas more often and if we do we will end up at Hash House during every visit. 

Side note: the wait early during the day is a longer one at this location. 100% worth the wait. We went to the location near Fremont St during the night the day after and had zero wait."
2290,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What great fun and amazing food.   The portions?  Enough for two, but be selfish and have everyone order their own!

The chicken was fab!  The pancake? Ginormous!

You can't go wrong here!"
2291,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've been stalking this place for at least 3 years! So glad I finally got to eat here! We landed at 6:50am, dropped our luggage off at the hotel and headed straight for Hash House A Go Go! There were no lines this early, but boy did one form shortly after our arrival. 

I knew from stalking the menu what I wanted. I ordered the tractor driver combo with French toast. It was absolutely delicious! You can taste the bananas and cinnamon in the toast itself, but the caramelized bananas on top were even better. I seriously couldn't stop eating. I was also very happy they offered turkey sausage. I don't eat pork and that's all most breakfast spots offer. They don't even charge you extra for it. The coffee was good and my eggs were perfectly scrambled. This was my favorite meal during my trip and I can't wait to come back."
2292,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Although this isn't the original one in Las Vegas it is my favorite.  It's located in the Linq right in the main area of Las Vegas blvd.  The food is amazing along with the service.  The food does come in large portions so come hungry.  They also have great drinks too.  

There  are a few of these restraints but you have to come to this location.  Very cool."
2293,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had andy's sage fried chicken and bacon waffle Benedict....OMG the most delicious combo I have ever eaten. It's a huge pile of everything you could possibly want- waffles, mashed potatoes, gravy, fried chicken breast, bacon, eggs over easy, tomatoes, spinach, hollandaise sauce, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something. The flavors complement each other perfectly. The portion is HUGE. My boyfriend and I split it and still had leftovers. One tiny complaint-the chicken was a tad dried out. I will definitely be coming here again. I want to try one of their other dishes but it's going to be hard not to get this again."
2294,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've become a big fan. Food portions are huge and quality is also decent. Each dish can easily be shared between 2 (or 3!) .
Wait time is long (can take up to 1-2 hours for bigger parties)
I will recommend this place to everyone who hasn't tried it yet."
2295,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I love the SD location and have been numerous times so was excited to check out the Vegas version. We were anticipating a long wait but it wasn't bad at all.. was told 25 mins but was really more like 10. 

I was immediately disappointed with the look and feel of the place. It is not as cute or kitschy as one in SD, and actually feel like a giant cafeteria. It occurred to me during my meal that I've been to this space before when it was the Imperial Palace Buffett.. and it still feels/looks like exactly like it. Hence, the cafeteria ambiance. 

The service was good and food was still good although my friend said his chicken benedict was lacking something from the SD version but he couldn't quite place it. My sausage gravy biscuits were good but I was a little annoyed because they had bell peppers all over the top when the menu didn't say it had them.. also my gravy was only lukewarm which was a bit of turnoff. The food is usually served hot with hot plates at the SD location.  Ugh.. 

Not sure if I'd come back to this location.. think I'll reserve my HHAGOGO cravings for the SD location. ;-) 

Note: The IP is being converted to a new hotel, The Quad so you have to walk thru a maze of construction to get to the HHAGOGO. It's a little annoying but not as bad as it seems."
2296,Hash House A Go Go,4,"it's better than many other options if you don't end up being in the line for hours. If you could manage to go with a Diamond member, then it's not too bad... Even after sitting down, It takes time to get your food or find ur server for something extra. The food options and quality are good."
2297,Hash House A Go Go,4,"2 words: portion size

Or lack thereof. Seriously, the plates here are massive and are sure to leave you feeling full. There were 8 of us and we ordered 4 dishes, which were perfect and left us all feeling satisfied. 

The blackberry pancakes were a huge hit and are different from the traditional buttermilk ones. The fried chicken and chorizo hash were also flavorful. They also have a variety of mimosas, including a 22 oz. one served in a vessel in the shape of a shapely fishnet-donned leg. Nice. Overall, tasty food although nothing overly fancy. Our party of 8 waited about 15 minutes for a table during a busy brunch and John, our server, was friendly and super helpful."
2298,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We decided to grab brunch before we headed back to Phoenix-- so glad that we did! I suggested this place to my husband and when he heard about some of the foods they offer up, he agreed to walk 2 miles up the strip from the Luxor to grab a meal before we left for home. 
We waited about 15-20 minutes a little before noon on a Monday. Not bad. Our waiter Nathaniel was really friendly, and let us know that the portions a big and it's okay to share. I love that they don't charge a split plate fee- I don't like restaurants that do. However, we decided to both get a meal so we could try more things. My husband went with the chicken and waffles, and I had the french toast with eggs and bacon on the side. Everything was so yummy!! We had left overs, so yes, you really can share and be plenty full. The prices were good, and brunch ran us $35 plus tip."
2299,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge huge portion sizes - can easily split a meal. Tried the chicken and waffles. Oddly delicious.  Friend tried the brown sugar banana pancake. Biggest pancake I've ever seen.  Definite stop when in Vegas.
2300,Hash House A Go Go,4,Was here 12/8/11 boyfriend had the meatloaf I was jealous I didn't order the same thing it was very well seasoned &moist the mash potatoes were cheesy goodness he said the veggies were tasty too the meatloaf is good! I had the chicken sandwich it wasn't seasoned that well type bland it was a large portion. My boyfriend also said the bartender made a good tasting long island ice tea the food also had a cute presentation and was well priced for so much food thumbs up hash house was the best food we had in Vegas and we ate at the cosmopolitan & bellagio
2301,Hash House A Go Go,2,Overrated. We had chicken and bacon waffles. It was so messy. All that extra garnish on the plate is ridiculous. Nothing special about the food in my opinion. It's just meh. You do get a lot of food. However it's pricey. We had alot of take home food to go. This food is not next day friendly. So it went right in the trash. A waste. Mom had cornbeef hash. It was ok. The child's French toast was a hit with my son. I've been and now I don't have to go back. I didn't see anything else I wanted to try.
2302,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We shared a GREAT meatloaf scramble with mashed taters...enough for 4 people. .Steven, our server, was always there with fresh brewed.  Just a yummy fun time...we come here on every visit to Lost Wages."
2303,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We ate here 2 times during our visit and it was so good. The first day my husband and I split the French toast and it was AMAZING. I don't think I've ever had French toast that good in my life. The second day we split the Andys chicken and a red velvet waffle which we had high hopes for. Unfortunately it just didn't compare to the French toast. The red velvet waffle was good but we were crazy about the chicken dish. 

I do give them a 4 star because the French toast and the prices are unbeatable. There were tons of other things on the menu that looked amazing as well so we will definitely go back and try others."
2304,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Meh...was crowded.  Food may have been fresh at some time, but did not come through that way.  Parts of my eggs were a bit tough.  Had to use a knife to cut my waffle (yes really). 

The staff was friendly and it was a lively environment.  

Wouldn't go out of my way to go back."
2305,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions, delicious food and great service. If you happen to be on the Vegas strip and want a great meal definitely make a stop here.  Also my Wife had a hot chocolate that she can't stop raving about."
2306,Hash House A Go Go,4,Thus place worked us out for breakfast on our last day of a bachelorette party. Bypass the line for a table and head for the bar. Jason is the bomb and he will not steer you wrong on what to order. He recommended the best orange/ tangerine/ champagne cocktail ever followed by the best breakfast we've ever had in Vegas. This place is not to be missed. I had a pancake that was bigger than a tractor tire!!!
2307,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We walked into Hash House expecting greatness based on the reviews we read here and for the first 15 minutes or so we weren't disappointed.  The place wasnt too busy so we were seated and attended to without delay. I ordered the crab cake with pasta salad appetizer, my husband ordered the fried chicken with biscuits and gravy, and our friend ordered the chicken and waffles. It seemed like all was going well but we couldn't have been more wrong. 

My husbands food came, and my food came, but our friends was nowhere to be seen. Our waiter came back and made a joke about the cook having just caught the chicken and assured us it would be right out so we waited, And waited, Annnnnnnnnd waited. Finally our friend encouraged us to go on without him so we dug in. We each gave him a bite of our food to be polite and tried each others. We agreed that both dishes were tasty but the chicken and biscuits was the winner hands down. In fact it was so tasty we decided then and there to round up the other 8 people in our group to return for breakfast the next morning for biscuits and gravy . Hubby and I nibbled slowly because we just knew that chicken and waffles plate would show up any minute now. Little did we know it wouldn't make an appearance for nearly 30 more minutes.  

We arrived together, ordered together, and ended up with two of us sitting back watching our friend eat his dinner while we twiddled our thumbs. That's just not the way I like to spend an evening dining out. After the raves and comparisons to Roscoes. the fact that he found the chicken to be edible but nothing special just put an extra twist on the knife of disappointment. To add insult to injury, the check arrived without any offer of a free dessert, small percentage off or anything. We decided to pass on breakfast after all. We definitely wont be going back to Hash House again."
2308,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Snickers Flapjack!!! 

Being from Britain, we have a slightly different take on flapjacks, they are oaty cereal type bars... after ordering the Snickers flapjack and seeing it arrive at my table I was very pleasantly surprised!! 

The snickers flapjack is basically a HUGE pancake which has been stuffed with pieces of Snickers chocolate bar. The combination is to die for! What's not to like about pancakes and Snickers!! 

The portion size is ridiculous! I'd say this dish is for at least two people, although I certainly have no complaints about this ;) I managed to save this for lunch and dinner! 

The prices are great for the size of portions you get! 

The only downside is the wait time! It wasn't a big problem for us because we got our ticket in the queue/line and went down to the casino area and played blackjack and roulette for 45mins while we waited for our number to be called. We did makesure we came back to the hash house before our number was called as there was no way of hearing your number being called in the casino area. 

All in all I'd give this place a 5 for the food but a 3 for the waiting system. It could be improved!"
2309,Hash House A Go Go,3,The portions are very generous and the food was pretty good but the place was super noisy and it was difficult to have a conversation.
2310,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I don't know if it's because this place is newer than the older LV location, and not polished yet but execution was poor...

I had the Sage Chicken Benny, or thought I did... the first time they brought it out without the chicken... presentation was nice and flavors were great.

My friend, had a egg dish and asked for whites... but they messed that one up too...

My other friend had the banana and brown sugar pancake, and it was marvelous! You don't even need the syrup!

The food was awesome overall.

The biscuits were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend noticed a little metal jar, next to the sugar, salt and pepper shakers, and discovered a wonderful blackberry chutney (jam) and it accompanied the biscuit wonderfully! Would've been nice if the waitress mentioned it...

The mashed potatos with skin were great as well, perfectly seasoned, we didn't have to add anything to it.

The sage chicken is OMG good, although I would probably go with the chicken and waffles next time, cause I think the sauce on the benny, although good, was overwhelming... maybe if they used half the amount, I would've ate the whole thing.

The amount of food they give you is like ""hungry man"" portions, and value, is well worth every penny! The only other complaint I have, other than the miscommunication between the order and chef was the feel of being hurried in a sense...
The portions are huge, so the group had about half of their dish left. Every 3 mins, it seemed one staff member or another lliked to come by and ask if we were done... let me tell, I was chewing my food still!!! also instead of asking us, if we wanted to-go boxes, they just took it away, when we said we were done... Now, perhaps it was our fault that we didnt say anything, but I thought it would've been courteous and nice to have been asked...

So, I would give this place 5 stars for the food, when they get it right, and minus 2 stars when they are off, and in this visit they were off."
2311,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was expected to be wowed by Hash House A Go Go, especially it being a classic Las Vegas restaurant. They were very busy even for a Monday but we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table for two. 

I was originally going to order the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles because it looked absolutely delicious but decided to order the Andy's Famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I wish I had ordered the former. This Chicken Benedict is extremely huge, and could probably be shared by three people. I felt like there was too much going on - the mashed potatoes right next to the biscuits, swimming in sauce. It is definitely too heavy to eat for brunch. The best part about this dish is the fried chicken itself. It was crispy and tasty. It wasn't for me but I'm sure other people would enjoy it. 

Our server was top notch! I would definitely be back to order something else."
2312,Hash House A Go Go,4,It's great but takes absolutely forever to get a table. You're better off taking a cab to Rio and eating at the location there.
2313,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Hash House a No No!

We put out names on the list and came back 30 minutes later as instructed only to find that they lost our names on the list! We had to argue with the hostess insisting that we had put our names down and eventually they just decided to seat us. 

We all ordered there Basic Breakfast with eggs, toasts, sausage, and potatoes. Sounds impossible to mess up right? Nope.

My mother had to send back her eggs because they were cold, rubbery, and very overcooked. Personally my breakfast was decent, but not better than something I could get at a Denny's.

This place's claim to fame is their chicken and waffles and huge heart-attack inducing portions. In my opinion, for a restaurant to be noteworthy, all of their menu items should be delicious, not just their signature item.

This palace is also EXTREMELY loud. You will have to yell at the top of your lungs to be heard by someone sitting directly next to you. 

Overall, the incompetent host staff, mediocre food, and irritatingly loud atmosphere definitely do not warrant a return visit to this joint. You'll get the same breakfast quality at a Denny's or Chompies at a much better price."
2314,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is delicious !!! The coffee was very strong and good. The service was 10/10. The portions are huge so I would recommend sharing with someone if you have a small appetite .
2315,Hash House A Go Go,4,"AMBIENCE: A little hectic, especially when you first get off the escalator. You walk straight into a crowd and it's not clear where to go to get your name on the list (hint: it's on the right). 

SERVICE: Friendly and patient while I pored over the tantalizing menu, asking repeatedly for a couple more minutes. Even though the waitress was clearly busy, she kept checking on us. 

FOOD: I got talked out of ordering the (gigantic) blueberry pancakes and went with the chicken and waffles instead. It comes with 4 big waffle squares and 2 large fried chicken breasts. Definitely too much for one person. If the chicken fried steak is on the menu when you're there, you have to get it. It was enormous. 

VALUE: Excellent. Especially for being on the strip. You may want to split an entree. 

DRAWBACK: The wait can be super long. We actually got on the list, went up to our hotel room for 45 min, came back, and then waited another 15 minutes before we were called. Then we waited another 10 minutes before actually being seated. The food/value make this place worth the wait though."
2316,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I can see why this place has so many great reviews. The big portions are a novelty, yes, but they also taste delicious. I ordered the quesadilla on top of a bed of mashed potatoes and I was not at all disappointed. I could barely eat 1/3 of it but it was very satisfying. 

The wait time was less than they predicted for us and our food felt very fresh as well. The server was nice and very prompt despite the busy atmosphere. 

Yes it is pricey but it's a good dining experience!"
2317,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Whenever we are in Las Vegas this is a must eat for  breakfast/brunch. Here's my review:

 1) SERVICE - 3 stars. It's my first time to dine in this location and it was packed! Waited for 30 mins to be seated and another 30 mins for the food. Our waitress was nice and deliver our drinks as fast as possible. 

2) FOOD - 5 stars. For the price and the portion of the food that you get its so worth it! We ordered only 2 entrees for a group of 4. We all shared it and left the restaurant pretty stuffed! My favorite is the Sage Chicken with Waffles! The chicken is crispy on the outside, soft and juicy in the inside, and then you drizzled it with the maple syrup that comes with it and it's HEAVEN!  We also ordered the Original Benedict, it's loaded with carbs (biscuits on top of mashed potatoes), tomatoes, spinach and bacon. In case you were wondering the red strings that they put in a every dish is a deep fried angel hair pasta. Not sure if it's just for decoration but it gives a nice crunch to the dish.

3) AMBIENCE - 3 stars - Nice atmosphere for breakfast and the place looks clean."
2318,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After much hype from the Man Vs Food episode with Adam Richman, Hash House A Go Go  opened a 2nd location at the Imperial Palace on the STRIP.

HHAGG is known for their Enormous portions of farm fresh food with a twist and we have been to the Sahara location several times including the Man v Food shooting so we were hoping to see the SAME food,service and atmosphere as the original.

The entry/waiting area has a wall of photographs of celebrities who have visited. The dining room is typical with boothes along the walls and tables filling in between. A few TV's i n the center hanging from the the ceiling a small bar along one wall.

When we arrived there was NO line so we were seated immediately but don't surprised if you have to wait 30-45 minutes when it gets busy. This place is well staffed so they keep it moving.

We ordered drinks-coffee and soda then our meal-I got the fried pork tenderloin sandwich & fries and My son @milesdavisvegas got the Farmer's Daughter-French Toast w/bacon & eggs.

It took awhile for the food to come out -I had 3 cups of coffee waiting but the place really got busy after we arrived and Our waiter was NEW,actually his 1st day on the job.

The pork tenderloin was FANTAsTIC-thin & crispy-pickles onion and ketchup!!

The french toast was great-thick cinnamony with strawberries and banana,the bacon was crisp and the eggs cooked PERFECTLY over-easy lots of yolk no runny whites!!

I'm a little biased towards this place because its 1/2 places in Las Vegas that serve a tenderloin sandwich so I don't really explore the menu -just burgers,breakfast & the tenderloin BUT I see lots of people trying the chicken & waffles really killin them:)

I see the Reviews on YELP really rip this location but that wasn't my experience. The service was good, the food was good and it has the same feel as the original location minus the long wait.

My only knock on this place is the prices but that's just me-because-I mean the biggest thing about a midwest menu is that it's  simple & CHEAP!!!"
2319,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Horrible experience here. Came in with my husband to get some breakfast. The waitress(Tina) came over and didn't even greet us just rudely took our order. She served us our food and barely like 2 bites into it, she walks by doesn't even say anything and just leaves the bill there. After that she never bothered to come by and check up on us. I had to ask another waiter for a box. And this guy never came back with the box either so I had to go hunt down our waitress to ask her for a box. But sadly their rude employees wasn't the worse part... about half way through my meal I noticed a hair in my food. Worse restaurant experience ever."
2320,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Brown sugar banana pancake was huge! Probably 10 inches in diameter, and delicious! The warm bananas were scrumptious and the brown sugar partially caramelized giving it a nice crisp. Our server Travis was excellent: quick with the coffee refills and when my husband tried to order the most basic breakfast on the menu he encouraged him to branch out & try something new. Excellent chow, highly recommend!"
2321,Hash House A Go Go,4,My highest rating for a breakfast venue ever !
2322,Hash House A Go Go,4,"What a great place, went there after reading reviews on Yelp and seeing it on Man vs. Food.  Adam went for the Sage Fried Chicken Waffles and so did someone in our party. 

We went there with eleven (11) people over the Memorial Day weekend, it's located in the shabby Imperial Palace hotel full of smoke on the first floor, but when you go up to the second floor where it's located, it's not that bad. There are definitely some folks that should not be eating at a place like this, but who am I to judge. We waited about 45 minutes even though they said it would be 30....I think the key here is to come in the early afternoon instead of at peak times around 10-11 AM. 

The food was served on serving platters instead of plates, yes it was that big. Check out some of the photos.  We ordered everything from the Sage Fried Chicken Waffles to the Salmon Sandwich and Meatloaf special.  I would say the meatloaf and the sage fried chicken dishes were the best. Service can be hit or miss, but they kept the coffee and the water flowing so we didn't dehydrate and had liquid to keep things washed down. 

Overall a great place to eat and you get through it with drinks for about $20 a person, this is a better experience than eating at a breakfast buffet for the same price."
2323,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fun, Awesome, Wonderful Staff - the portions are HUGE. 4 people could literally share one meal. I loved it all!"
2324,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So much food!! Featured on Man vs Food, Hash House already has the notoriety of celebrities and tourists alike. The food is unforgettable and your jaw drops when you see it before you. The portion sizes will make you challenge you friends and family to simply finish your plate. Overall, I would recommend it to everyone and anyone, especially if your visiting Vegas for only a few days. Oh and don't order two pancakes. Trust me."
2325,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is pretty awesome! 3stars because i'm more of a health freak and i wanted some healthier options. overall, the portions are HUUGE,  I tried the Corned beef sandwich, onions were sweet, the beef was tender and juicy, the bread was lightly buttered, and the cucumber dressing on the salad was creamy and flavorful. Perfect complement considering it was 2am in the morning. on a separate visit, i had the salmon omlette which wasn't that great and was more on the fishy side and oily side(it was drenched with olive oil to cook the fish)  overall its a pretty awesome place. 
btw. the chairs suck .. they've been ruined by fat butts, so you tend to sink into them in an uncomfortable way where your arms are a bit elevated ... (mind you, i'm 5'7)"
2326,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our first morning in Vegas we woke up early and were hungry so a quick check of Yelp led us to picking Hash House A Go Go. We arrived, gave our name and were seated within minutes but when we left we saw people piled into the waiting area. 

I was tempted by the chicken and waffles and the BLT, but after talking to Michael our server I went with the flapjack, bacon and eggs because when he said it was one flapjack the size of a medium size pizza, I wanted to see it! It was definitely large and perfectly made, but as someone who only likes to eat the middle of a pancake after it's been soaked with butter and syrup there was plenty of real estate to cover! The bacon was crispy as requested and the scrambled eggs weren't dry or overcooked.

If you're in the area and have an appetite for breakfast, go but be prepared to wait if you're going closer to brunch hours."
2327,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food and drinks here were so good and worth the 1 hour wait. We had a party of 8 and we all had something different everyone loved everything.
2328,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Alt for store portioner, jeg savnede min Lurpak smÃ¸r pÃ¥ min vaffel, fik sgu kvalme af det margarine de bruger herovre 

Men vaflen smagte ganske glimrende og personalet var meget venligt"
2329,Hash House A Go Go,3,The first time we came here the service and food was amazing--we had a few different things but the most memorable was the chicken and waffles and the giant banana pancake. Came back again 2 years later and the food was just okay and the service was lack luster. There is always a wait to get in yet it took us about 20 minutes to get the check! Absolutely loved it the first time though so may just depend on the day!
2330,Hash House A Go Go,5,Their portions are massive so you will need a to go box.  Every dish has a unique twist to your traditional favorites.  Sage chicken Benedict and chicken and waffles are two amazing dishes and the server was great.  Great place to go
2331,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My friends and I were looking for dinner options, and since we were already staying in the LINQ hotel, we figured this was a good place to go! When people say the portions are big here, they mean that they are HUGE. I consider myself to have a pretty big appetite, and I could barely finish my meal. 

We all ordered some type of burger, and I got the fresh mushroom and swiss. Our food took a while to come out, but that may have been because of our larger party. It was worth the wait though, because my burger was delicious! The mushrooms were perfect and the patty was huge and juicy! By the time I finished it, I could barely eat any fries. At least half of my friends had to take their food to-go because they were stuffed! Next time I'm here, I might have to consider splitting a dish, haha. Prices weren't too bad either, considering we were in Vegas. I would definitely recommend this place and might be back in the future myself :)"
2332,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Start with the Bloody Mary while you wait. Vanilla Latte (better than the Honey Vanilla latte I just had last night only because it is less sweet. Watermelon ""something"" yes I have a pic.  Corn bread (you can see the corn). ... Best strategy might be to share.  but here is what I tried that was good. They are HUGE.  Milford Fried Chicken Sandwich. Sage Fried Chicken & waffles.   Hard to find, Quad .. down the hall ... up the elevator , then really crowded. :)"
2333,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food, but service was SLOW!! Split meals for sure!  Pork tenderloin was terrific."
2334,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is absolutely phenomenal. The service is excellent everyone really does seem like they enjoy their jobs there, so that always helps make the overall vibe/ feel a lot better. Drink selections  were very wide which is always a perk. Lots of juices housemaid drinks and plenty of alcohol. But the thing that I was thoroughly impressed with was the great selection of delicious foods that were in the buffet. You get everything from pan Thai noodles, blue cheese stuffed tortellini with pork sausage,or even get pan seared salmon. Now it's one thing to have a wide selection of great foods but it's another for them to taste good as well because sometimes when you get quantity you really sacrifice quality. And this place break that rule there's a wide variety of things you can get, and each of them taste like he was personally made for you!"
2335,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow! Great Service! The portions are HUGE! I didn't go with any of the gimmick menu items. I just had ""The Basic."" Two eggs, hash browns and bacon. It was only *$8.99 and it was just the right size for one person."
2336,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My fiance and I went there last week while we were in Vegas for our birthdays, and the service was amazing, especially given we came in around 8pm on a Wednesday night. My fiance got the chicken and waffles (a must if it's your first time here), which are always fabulous, and I got the Crab Cake Benedict, but they were awful: the saucy was too heavy on the dish, to the point where you couldn't even taste the egg in between the sauce and the crab cake... Plus, the mashed potatoes underneath the biscuit made zero sense.

Don't get me wrong, this place has great food, but I think I just chose their worse dish they have to offer, which is why I knocked off two stars."
2337,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had breakfast here on a quick trip to Vegas recently. We were extremely lucky to get in on a Tuesday at 9:30 am. No line at that time. I had the Corned Beef Hash scramble and my girlfriend had the Bacon grilled cheese sandwich. She liked the food but thought the bacon was too strong smoke flavor. I really enjoyed the the Hash but the didn't enjoy the sides as much. Overall, it as great and would definitely go back."
2338,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I finally got to try this brunch spot after late night clubbing in Vegas. Definitely worth going after along night of dancing and for late night cravings. Hash house is open 24hrs in the LinQ hotel.
I came with a group of 5, around 430AM and we were seated within 15 mins. We ordered 3 plates total to share- the breakfast hash, burger with fries, and chicken & waffles. The portion sizes were so large and we could barely finish our meal (plus take some to go). Would definitely recommend checking this place out as one of the top late night Vegas eats. 

Pic features: chicken and waffles"
2339,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had my first fried chicken and waffles ($17.50) so good! The sage chicken was delicious: extra crispy yet so moist. I recommend breaking down the tower when it comes to the table (after taking a photo to savor it for later) to prevent the bottom two bacon waffles from getting all soggy. Also, if you go make sure to bring a friend or two. No matter what you order, there's enough to feed 2-3 people...unless you're a Polynesian linebacker :D

When you get there, be prepared to wait. They have some interesting things to look at and they have wifi, but seating is at a limited supply. Also, use the bathroom before you go up the stairs...I don't think they have one up there."
2340,Hash House A Go Go,5,First time in Vegas and this was the first stop. Huge portions of great food and great staff to give us pointers on the sights and sounds of the strip. Definitely a must try!
2341,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I would categorize this as a ""must"" for breakfast while in Vegas. A lot of people feel the same way because there was a wait at 8:30 that continued growing throughout the morning. The restaurant is really unique and funky. I haven't been anywhere like it. This would be the perfect spot to cure a hangover because the portions are gigantic. Whatever you think of as a large portion, double that. No one in our group was able to finish their meal. Plus, the prices are very reasonable by Vegas standards... $15-$20 for an enormous plate of food. 

But being a good value isn't enough to earn a high rating from me; the food has to be good. I was half expecting the food to be more show than substance, but I was mistaken. The food at Hash House is excellent. I had the Tractor Driver combo with bacon, scrambled eggs with goat cheese, and the banana brown sugar pancake. Everything was fantastic. The bacon and scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly. The pancake was deliciously sweet. I wanted to gobble it all up, but the pancake was the size of Texas. 

On top of that, the service was great. Timely and friendly. Our server had spiked green hair and was super cool. She was helpful with giving suggestions. She allowed us time when needed but we were never waiting when we didn't want to be. 

I will definitely return here on future trips to Vegas. Amazing food at reasonable prices accompanied by good service. Doesn't take much more than that trifecta to make me happy."
2342,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here this past weekend for Brunch. i am SOOOO glad our friends told me & my bf to split a plate because of the huge portions because i probably would have ended up puking from trying to finish it all. 

the bf & i split the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. the order came with 2 BIG pieces of chicken & 4 waffles. 

the waffles had bacon INSIDE them!! as good as that was i still dont know how i feel about the bacon being inside them as i found myself picked apart the waffles just so i could have a strip of bacon. the waffle & syrup just kind of over powered the taste of the bacon & as a bacon lover i do NOT want that.
the chicken was delicious, nice & crispy & very tasty when added syrup to it.

i took of one star because of the service. Our waitress was really nice & all but i think we were there for a total of 2 maybe even 2&ahalf hours because of how long it took for them to take our oder, get our food out, bring us the check, & give us back our change. we got our food brought to us last because they said that the chicken & waffles took longer to make, which i really dont understand why because i know how to make fried chicken & it does not take an 45 mins to fry 2 pieces, even if you double fry them, which HHAGG's did not seem double fried. but other than the wait i really cant complain. i am not as impatient as some people

for the price of the food & the portions you really cant beat it, i might come back if someone else in our group wants to & if we arent too hungry to wait a while before we eat. but id really rather explore what else vegas has to offer for breakfast/brunch"
2343,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Not too bad, but not amazing. We came here early on a Friday and waited for a while to get a seat. We ordered Andy's sage fried chicken and the veggie hash. 

Andy's fried chicken: The sauce was pretty tasty, but it was mostly cream. It was some kind of hollandaise sauce. I liked this better than the hash. Chicken and biscuits tasted good. Overall, I'd probably order this again. The portion is also humongous and can be shared between 3-4 people, so it's a pretty good deal for the price. 

Veggie hash: pretty bad. The potatoes were soggy and the seasoning was subpar. Don't be fooled that you'll get a crispy hashbrown-like dish. The potatoes are in cubes. 

Overall, I don't mind giving this place another shot or coming here with friends if we want breakfast or late night dinner on the strip. It's a better choice than I-HOP or Denny's."
2344,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The portions here are absolutely huge when I when I ordered the mash potato burger which was absolutely amazing and giant, and my mom ordered the chicken pot pie which was not only the biggest she's ever had but it also was the best and she went to the Cordon Bleu to be a chef for a living! The portion size and food quality had my family who is visiting not only laughing because it was so awesome but they couldn't stop eating because it was so good! If you are visiting this place is a must! My mom's chicken Popeye was seriously so big she could've put the pastry on her head as a hat if that gives you an idea haha"
2345,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Portions are huge and can definitely be shared. But the food is so good you will not want to share. The sage fried chicken, and biscuits and gravy were amazing. Miss this place already"
2346,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing and creative breakfast!  We will make it required stop every trip to Vegas!
2347,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was in Vegas last weekend and, in my quest for a unique breakfast, stumbled upon this place. First, let me say that this restaurant proudly represents what Vegas stands for. The food is big..Huge... And ultra...  I mean ULTRA tasty. When I draft a review, I comment on 3 areas: Food, service, and price. 

The service was decent... Above average, but not over the top. The servers we experienced were attentive and friendly. Some were rather unique looking but hey, that's Vegas. One thing I liked was that everyone we talked to acted as if they were happy and proud to work there. I like that! The atmosphere was very casual and the place was a bustling with activity. I was happy and comfortable.

The food....WOW...the food.  OK, it took me quite some time to decide what to order.  Everything on the menu looked good!  So did the plates of food I saw passing by!  I ended up ordering the fried chicken benedict...a Man vs. Food favorite.  It did not disappoint.  In one word: Unbelievable.  This place prides themselves on twisted farm food.  The portions were HUGE and the taste was outstanding!  My girl ordered the brown sugar and banana pancake.  It was the size of a medium pizza!  It tasted so good that you would need to sit down to eat it.  This is simply no joke.  My only regret is that I didn't get to try other things on the menu.  If you are in a party of 4, I would highly recommend ordering 3 totally different breakfasts and then sharing them.  This would allow you to try different things and you would in no way be short on food.  This restaurant definitely did deliver in every sense of the word.  BOOYAH!

The price was amazingly reasonable for Vegas.  It was priced similar to IHOP but with all the huge portions and pizazz of a meal you cant get just anywhere.  For the two of us it was 28 dollars with drinks!  We did order too much food though as neither of us could finish.  My taste buds wanted more but my stomach simply couldn't handle another bite!

I just love this place.  I am glad we found it and I cant wait to go back the next time I visit Las Vegas."
2348,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is fat guy food, through and through.

The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, as seen on Man vs. Food. Like fuck off this shit is too good get out of here I hate you.

The Famous Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits was also amazing and I love me some biscuits and gravy. Hash House has some of the best."
2349,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh. MY. GOD! This place is delicious. The food is so good they could of had terrible service (which they didn't) and I'd still give them 5 stars. The meals are very large. One dish is enough for 3 people. And did I mention it was delicious?!!!! Reminds me of Big Pinks back home. 

One of my new favorites. I wish I had 2 stomachs just for this place!"
2350,Hash House A Go Go,5,Delicious to say the least. OMG the portions here are enough to feed a family of 4. Totally recommended as a MUST go place when visiting Vegas.
2351,Hash House A Go Go,3,Very large portions. Easy for couples to share. The lemonade mimosa is flavorful. Don't arrive hungry in May be a long wait. You have to order sage  chicken and waffles.
2352,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was amazing. Our waiter Brian was awesome. The food Great. This is a place we definitely will be going to again.  I love the fact that they are open 24/7 and Brian had some great suggestions. My husband got the sage fried chicken and waffles and I got the French toast with bananas and pecans. We also started with the ""bacon, bacon, bacon"" aka Bacon Crack. Bacon will never be the same.  We each had leftovers of course and this morning it's a whole other meal. Still as good as the last night. Make sure you also try the kiwi watermelon lemonade. You get to keep the glass and it tasted great! Yummmmm."
2353,Hash House A Go Go,5,Delicious!!! The Best Thing I Ever Ate..Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict! Everything Is Fresh and good! If Come To Vegas You Have To Eat Here!!!
2354,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Assolutamente da provare, ma solo se veramente affamati: le porzioni sono enormi! !!! SpecialitÃ  Pollo fritto alla benedict: man Vs food non sbaglia mai!!!!"
2355,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Underwhelmed.  Waited for about an hour just to be seated.  We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and honestly, it was pretty mediocre.  The chicken was solid (crispy skin, white meat, good flavor) but the waffles were horrible.  Absolutely no flavor.

Honestly, it didn't live up to the hype."
2356,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome food!  Tremendous portions!  I highly recommend stopping and grabbing anything from the menu to eat.
2357,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The service sucks,  and the food was so gross that my husband and I had to cancel our check.  Never again going there."
2358,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I realize that this place is known from it's appearance on the show Man vs. Food and that  other reviewers have rated it positively, but don't believe the hype! Perhaps the target clientele (extremely drunk people) are easily impressed with the theatrical food. On the other hand, anyone who values their time and money shouldn't bother.
We visited HHAGG at about 4:00 A.M. on a Saturday. We waited 15-20 minutes to be seated. We all ordered ASAP but the first wave of food took 35 minutes and the second took an additional 10-15 minutes. The entire time, people arriving and ordering after us received their food before we saw our waitress again. Also during this time, the ""security guard"" had nothing better to do than to wait for quiet, non-belligerent drunk people to look sleepy and wake them up. Ok sure, but what about the incredibly loud and annoying drunk people a booth over? Nope, they're fine, he'll leave them be.  The food finally arrived and looked impressive, especially for the price- huge portions, lots of color, etc. Disappointment was quick to follow.
What we ordered:
1. Swiss and mushroom burger (just ok, she was not impressed) and sweet potato fries (these were actually enjoyed)
2. Ham, egg, and cheddar burger (also just ok), french fries (crispy and pretty good) and a chocolate milk (just a large glass of milk with Hershey's sauce on the inside of the glass like some kind of ""deconstructed chocolate milk""; she spent 5 minutes scraping the chocolate from the sides and mixing it in)
3. Farm scrabble (which she enjoyed) with ""crispy"" potatoes (mushy, bland potatoes) and a biscuit (huge and tasted ok but had a shell hard enough to play hockey with)
4. ""The Basic"": eggs (which he liked) and the same gross potatoes and mediocre biscuit with a ridiculous sprig of rosemary sticking out the top
5. The Hash: not quite ""hash"" really but tasted good, bland eggs, and those potatoes and biscuit
It then took another 20+ minutes to get the check after we asked. 

Basically, if you're drunk or easily impressed by large herbs,you might actually like this place and if not, eat literally anywhere else."
2359,Hash House A Go Go,5,"AMAZING FOOD!!! Huge portions, I ordered the Chorizo, so good, a little spicy if you like spicy foods. Real deal Chorizo, not no fake stuff. My mother had the corn beef, it was also excellent. Real deal corn beef as well! Atmosphere is great, our waiter was also great!"
2360,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Way over-rated.  After a 25 minute wait in the lobby, we had another 20 minute wait at the table.   Watching the huge portions march by, made me h-angry.

Once we did order, it was another 50 minute to wait for the grub.  When I asked the waitress about our delay, she said it's normal to be 45 minutes.   So normal means this is a 2 hour breakfast.  But you do need your appetite because the portions are big enough for 3 people.

The eggs benedict dish was just ok.   The massive pancake was supposed to be off the hook, but was just another pancake as far as I'm concerned.     

Too much to do on the strip to waste 2 hours for mediocre breakfast."
2361,Hash House A Go Go,2,"If you're very hungry, I recommend coming here. Portions are very large. Even when we asked for extra plates for sharing, they were the same size as the ones that the food came out on.

The most famous dish they are known for is the Sage Fried Chicken Waffles, which is basically their specialty chicken on top of a stack of bacon waffles. If you're with someone, I really encourage you to share, unless you can take a large amount of food. 

The rest of their food is also well known, for example their Buttermilk Flapjack, a VERY large pancake w/butter and syrup. If you want a full breakfast, you can get the Tractor Driver Combo (two eggs w/choice of bacon, sausage, ham, or potatoes, w/1 buttermilk flapjack). The House Hashes were pretty good too."
2362,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came here for an early weekend lunch, there was a bit of a wait but it moved quickly and we were seated in about 15 minutes. The restaurant itself didn't stand out much in any way to me - just a typical looking place. After looking over the large menu, we decided to stick with what they are named for - Hash.  The portion was large and the food was tasty. My only compliant was that mine needed some sort of sauce as it was a bit dry. Don't get me wrong - it was good but not something I will dream of eating again if you know what I mean. My favorite thing was the biscuit - it was huge and served with a homemade-like strawberry jam. Very good! I also splurged on a hot chocolate which was more like a bowl of hot cocoa then a cup! It was yummy. :)"
2363,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place is pretty good. Warning huge portions!!!!  There was slight problems with the escalators leading to the restaurant. And then with the bathrooms. You had to head back down to the main area to use the bathroom there. Then walk back up again. The seating staff person I found rude. But the rest of the staff were amazing. Assisting with ordering and recommendations. Very impressed. The food was delicious and did not disappoint.
2364,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Quantity is not alway better then quality and I think that is what is lacking here. I get and appreciate the effort they try to make with the ""farm to table"" aspect they are trying to go for but this is in a huge hotel where it gets lost it is over eager to please and the food while plentiful and humungous in size it doent deliver on tatse it is missing something, like restraint and finesse. The wait staff get points for personality and knowledge of the menu and its offerings but they cannot over come the fact that it is all show and  no substance. I would prefer if they had the left the Red Cup Cafe in here it's food was superior and it was quaint and unassuming."
2365,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The legendary Hash House A Go Go located in The Linq! I was pretty excited to try this place out and already knew what I wanted to order before I even stepped in to the hotel. We got the chicken and waffles. Duh. Get there early (like before 9 am), because lines start forming and this place gets packed! Obviously they are known for gigantic portions here, so definitely get a dish to split between two or even three people! The waffles were a bit dry, and the chicken needed salting, but it was pretty good. And certainly impressive; someone at the table next to me even asked if they could take a photo. My boyfriend and I also got 2 mimosas and the total for our meal was $50. 

The next time we went (yes, in the same visit), we got Andy's benedict, which is a ridiculous behemoth of a dish that includes mashed potatoes, two biscuits, two fried chicken breasts, a thick blanket of crunchy cheese, bacon, and chipotle cream sauce. Unghghhhh it was so much food but I powered through and was able to finish most of my half (except for the biscuit... I don't really like biscuits. And these were pretty dry). 

The server we had on our first visit was awesome - super friendly, helpful, attentive and nice without being annoying or overbearing. He was also quick and we never had to ask him for anything. My boyfriend and I both commented that this guy is like the gold standard for servers. 

Overall I don't think I'd visit again, now that I've been twice. It's pretty gimmicky and ridiculous with the amount of food you get, and the food is decent but nothing amazing, to-die for. If you like pancakes, check this place out. They are basically the size of manhole covers."
2366,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We had been told by many a people that we just HAD to go here. So after a late night of gambling and some sleep we trudged over to Linq to have chicken and waffles. 

When we entered we knew we were going to be in for some good food. There was a line out the door and a 20 minute wait. Luckily we were well prepared and enjoy people watching. 

We each ordered mimosas and split the sage chicken and waffles. THEY. WERE. AMAZING. And the plate was absolutely gigantic. I'm so glad we chose to share. It was the perfect meal and kept us full for most of the day. I'm a sucker for bloddy mary's and wish i would have gotten the BLT mary. I saw another table ordered a round and I plan on getting one next time we are in vegas. Tomato slice, piece of lettuce, bacon and a side of toast. 

Beyond the food, the service was prompt and impeccable. We watched all the waiters whip back and forth with huge smiles. The bussers were right on the empty tables and the turn around time was impressive. 

This is a must go to, as in the name a go go. We will be back."
2367,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh my!!! Best breakfast place ever!! You need to come here if you are coming to Vegas! But make sure to come when you are STARVING! The plates and even drinks are gigantic! I ordered a breakfast quesadilla with chorizo that was perfect, all the flavors of the cheese, jalapeÃ±o, chirizo, mashed potatoes, and red sauce blended in so perfectly. My boyfriend ordered Andy's fried chicken Benedict. HUGE! He eats ALOT, yet he could not even finish half of his plate. The sauce and the fried chicken was the best part. Oh and the drinks!! I ordered the a caramel all over Mocha coffee...HUGE! Lol the cup was larger than the cup you get for soft drinks at any restaurant, plus it was topped with a whole bunch of whip cream with hot fudge and caramel syrup."
2368,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place gets two stars from me for being open 24 hours and a third star for good service. However, just based on quality of the food, I'd say, one star. Portions are huge but the food has no taste. May be they figured the ""late late night"" diners don't care. I had a bacon/avocado scramble. It was very bland and felt like someone threw in all the leftovers into the pan. My husband ordered a Benedict. And wow, we were speechless. This mess of a plate had a biscuit, scramble, deep fried battered chicken, and mashed potatoes.  It was nowhere near a Benedict and was disgusting. Even the parts of the dish alone were not that good. I guess this dish's big claim to fame is that it was featured on Man vs. Food. I'd say you are better off eating at a fast food place."
2369,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Come Hungry! 

Upstairs hidden in Linq Hotel you'll find Hash Has A Go Go. A few friends had recommended checking this hidden gem out and we were not disappointed.'

I ordered the Tractor (Pancake and Eggs) and my husband ordered Chicken & Biscuits. The menu did not due the portions justice as they were ridiculously large! 

I would highly recommend ordering one meal to be split and an appetizer. We ended up taking boxes of food back to the room and had left overs for 2 Days!"
2370,Hash House A Go Go,4,"WOW! DELICIOUS!!! I am convinced there are giants cooking in the kitchen. The serving sizes are HUGE. The prices were great, considering how much food you are getting. Two people can easily share one meal. 

We were a party of four. We went during the week, Wednesday, September 4th. We got there just in time to beat the rush, and we still had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. It was SO worth it.
I ordered the sage chicken with maple reduction, served with eggs and mashed potatoes. INCREDIBLE!
Mom ordered the ""basic"" breakfast and LOVED it. 
Friend ordered biscuits and gravy with side of bacon....yum!
Fiance ordered eggs with mango, coconut flapjack. The flapjack was HUGE...I mean, seriously, the size of  a large skillet. 
Over all, GREAT experience. The server was on top of things, though they did have to correct a couple of minor things with our order. (mom asked for a biscuit, but got toast; fiance got sausage but asked for ham)."
2371,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Definitely gimmicky. Don't get me wrong, the food is good but not amazing, yes the portions are enormous, what this place is all about and it ""looks"" great but that is pretty much where it ends. I ordered the Meatloaf skillet (pictures included). The meatloaf was lacking any ""homemade"" flavor and was fairly bland. The potatoes had a good crisp to them and the eggs were cooked well. 
The one great compliment I will give as always is the biscuits. Huge, warm and tasty and don't forget the strawberry jam that is in the little metal dish, center table. 

Service was quick, was there a little after opening. 
2nd time visit to this location in Imperial Palace(the parking is a maze, be prepared)"
2372,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Not sure if this place rates 3.5 or 4 stars just because it's tucked way back inside the Linq Casino, up some stairs and, at least the morning we went on a Thursday, demands a 30 - 40 minute wait.  Had a similar experience at the one in Summerlin so it's probably just an indicator of the service and the FOOD.  

It was so packed it was hard to see much except the crowd and the aforementioned wait had us edgy to get going on our drive back to LA, so I didn't have much time to take in the decor.  Corrugated chrome and a farm gone slightly off seem to be the main theme.  They even have a kiosk that lets you take a selfie to prove you waited a long time for breakfast in there.  For such a high turnover of customers the serving staff are on fire.  They keep your water and coffee full and they tell you they don't keep anything under heat lamps so your food comes out hot and fresh though all in all, I don't think we were waiting very long.  Maybe 10 minutes tops?  

The ""off"" theme, now that I consider it, must have something to do with aliens or government experiments with growth serums.  The food portions are not generous.  They're off the wall ENORMOUS!  I knew this going in, so I suggested we split an entree.  However, he wanted a pancake so we ordered a single blueberry pancake to go with the Fried Chicken and Eggs.  Even so, the healthy sized chunk of fried chicken breast (their batter is SO good - didn't like it as much at Summerlin location), the pile of rich mashed potatoes over bacon, perfect over medium eggs and fluffy awesome biscuit had to be mostly transferred into a styrofoam box at meal's end along with half of the 16"" x 2"" blueberry pancake they amusingly call a side.  Roughly $30 pays for about 5 - 6 meals!"
2373,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HHAGG was soooooo good!!! Came around 1am on a Friday night and was told there was a 10 minute wait  however I saw a ton of empty seats lol not sure what that was all about but that was my only complaint! Now let's get to this amazing food they have! I ordered the chicken and biscuits, talk about blow your socks off deliciousness!!!! The portions are literally as big as my head and enough to satisfy two ppl. They say go hard or go home, and this place definitely goes hard! The chicken was tender and juicy, the biscuit was hot and fresh and that gravy they use is outta this world good. When you marry all those powerful flavors together it packs a mighty punch! Definitely will be back next time I am in Vegas!!"
2374,Hash House A Go Go,3,Heard about this place from a friend...he said it was great so I decided to try it I'm happy I did! The food was good the presentation of the food was cool I liked  it. They give you so much food you won't be able to finish it by yourself I wish I would have shared with a friend. I tried the chicken and waffles stuffed with bacon.
2375,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I liked the vibe, my waiter was cool, and they give large portions!  I got a BLT so I can't really judge the food taste but I'd def go back. My favorite part of the restaurant was the music, I was in shock at all the great songs I heard...from Al green to singles off TLC's crazy sexy cool...i loved it!"
2376,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Waited about 20 minutes for a table, as we waited, the line behind us got bigger. Food made fresh when you order it with not much of a wait, big portions, great for people sharing, the pancake was a bit crispy (hard), but overall, everything tasted pretty good, one of the best crispy potatoes I've ever had. Staff were friendly and attentive."
2377,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best breakfast food place to eat in Vegas. I wanted something with eggs and my friend was craving for biscuits and gravy. I ordered the chorizo hash and he ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage. Their portions are huge! one order can feed two people. The has was excellent filled me up and my friend had to take his to go because his was a lot more than he could handle. Great place for when you and your friends are really hungry after a drunken night of partying and gambling.
2378,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went for breakfast and we just happen to time it right because tons of people came in right after us so it appears the wait can vary.  We got the mashed potatoes over biscuits and gravy and an omelet type thing but with so much more in them than what it sounds.  Everything has like a slightly added flavor and taste that the menu describes best as a little southwestern ingredients.  The amount of food for the money is plentiful it seems the drinks are high priced (or maybe on par for the strip).
Our server was really good until we were waiting a while for our check, but it was likely because so many people were seated after us.  This is a really tasty, unique, and fun food experience."
2379,Hash House A Go Go,3,Awesome portions but some of the dishes are bland. The pan cake was delicious and their bisket and gravy.
2380,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A work of art on a plate! 
My husband and I came to this restaurant on a Friday morning for breakfast at 8 am,and our wait was about 20 minutes. This restaurant was featured on Man vs. Food, so we had to try it!
There is no cell service in the restaurant which I thought was interesting.
The restaurant itself is very loud, it was hard to hold a conversation without yelling at each other. The decor had a diner like quality and the prices were very reasonable.
My husband had the avocado scramble, with a biscuit and hash browns. I would recommend this to the everyday customer, it was delicious.
I had the signature dish of chicken and waffles. It was roughly five waffles with bacon inside the waffle & 2 pieces of chicken topped with rosemary. There were dots of what seemed to be teriyaki sauce that decorated the edges of the plate. It had a very savory flavor and was way too much for one person to eat. I actually took a to go box with me and gave it to a homeless guy outside because I didn't want the meal to go to waste.
The meal itself was almost too pretty to eat. I don't think that I would ever order this again, but I had to try this just once. The flavors were just not my cup of tea.
I also ordered the house mimosa with tangerine and Asti champagne, which was delicious.
Our service from our waiter Rick was flawless.
Overall it is a good breakfast spot. I would come here again and the next time I would order a pancake! They were HUGE!!"
2381,Hash House A Go Go,3,This place is really busy and the wait can be lengthy. The food was good its more quantity than quality I would say. Service is lacking but possibly because its so busy.
2382,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Amid all the buffets is Hash House a Go Go, a fun, delicious, and affordable option in Vegas. This location is open 24 hours (not sure if all locations are) and is a great brunch option. We put our name on the list and was told the wait would be about 45 minutes. We weren't worried about the wait because there is stuff to do in the casino but do plan accordingly. The line never seemed to die down while we were there. 

We were given a booth in under the time they predicted. The menu is American food but many options. Disclaimer, the portions are huge and everything is under 20 bucks. Awesome deal in vegas. I ordered a pineapple mimosa (it was brunch after all) to start with while perusing the menu. I decided on the sage fried chicken with grilled mashed potatoes topped with bacon, eggs, and a biscuit. 

Like I said the portions are huge- I probably could have shared my dish (we all could have) but we decided to each get our own portion. The food was delicious. The chicken was moist, crispy, and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were on point (it was really like a mountain it was so much). The biscuit was delicious and I love a good biscuit. 

Highly recommend a visit at Hash House a Go Go! Staff was friendly and helpful, which is always a plus."
2383,Hash House A Go Go,5,The breakfast here is awesome!! The huge portions are fun and presentation and service were too notch!! I recommend the brown sugar banana pancake!!
2384,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Nostalgic diner style restaurant with humongous portions and good dishes. 

I read most of the Yelp review for this restaurant and knew I had to have breakfast here during my stay in Vegas

It was worth the walk from the Elara. 

Our waiter was good too. He opened with a warning that many of the servings are large portions (so says Yelpers too). I asked about the hash and was told it was a house specialty. The restaurant pulls fresh corned beef and cooks it in a skillet. That with two pouched eggs made for a wonderful breakfast . 

The interior is a blend of stainless and glass. It reminds me of the old dinners I used to frequent in upstate NY. 

My cappuccino was ok, not their best. I'm told the brewed coffee here is really good. Next time. 

The plate was served with a big ole biscuit and fresh strawberry jam. That was nice. 

While I was relaxing in the booth I overheard the tables next to me telling their waiter/waitress that this was their 5th or 7th time eating here. I believe it. I'm coming back too!"
2385,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The first attempt at visiting Hash House was at brunch time on a Saturday. Huge mistake. The line was about a 2 hour wait. My party and I decided to forego our original plan and instead come back after club shenanigans. 

We came back at around 4am, and huzzah, no line! We got seated right away. The atmosphere is a very casual ""farm diner"" theme.

I got Andy's Sage Chicken & Waffle Tower. The presentation was delectable. The chicken was sooo tender and the breading on it was DELICIOUS and crispy. The waffles were pressed with bacon inside of the batter. To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan. This technique was unique but left the bacon a bit soggy and chewy. The waffles were also soggy being the foundation of the heavy fried chicken. I would come back and just get the fried chicken."
2386,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG!!  The 40 min wait was SO WORTH it!!  They do not kid about LARGE PORTIONS but it's even more about EXCELLENT FLAVORS and DELICIOUSNESS in BIG PORTIONS! :)

There was four of us girls - enjoying our girls weekend in Vegas and my girlfriend said we absolutely had to try this place... knowing about the large portions - we figured we'd share - order 3 dishes for the  4 of us!

Wow - I think we should've stuck to 2 dishes for 4 of us but actually it didn't matter because we got to try their DELICIOUS and the BEST EVER Chicken and Waffles; along with their brown sugar banana pancake and their meatloaf hash...  a ""little"" of everything! :)

First - let me tell you - the Chicken and Waffles - while HUGE was truly the BEST I've ever had... and I've had plenty...  this is by far even better than Roscoe's or our local TOWN restaurant...  the chicken was juicy, crunchy with that SAGE flavor - OMG... add that to the light fluffy waffles... you absolutely had the best of sweet and FLAVORED savory...  a MUST try dish FOR SURE!!!

The meat loaf has was EXCELLENT - lots of bits of delicious meatloaf with veggies and potatoes - but I will admit the chicken and waffles definitely was our #1 choice...

Their brown sugar banana pancake was absolutely a great way to end the meal - wish we got it at the end versus at the same time as everything because I think HOT would've been even better...  they had so much bananas in there made the inside of the pancake gooey which is more like a dessert than a traditional pancake.... so we're not complaining! :)

Because their portions are so big - so hard to try different things - so I guess we'll just have to keep coming back to try different dishes!!

OH - and our server - wish I caught his name... was a HOOT - and so patient with us as one of the girls likes her coffee HOT... so he heated up her cup and poured fresh HOT coffee each time! :)

Loved this place -  now I understand the wait - and highly recommend for folks to try this place when in town!"
2387,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Took some friends here for breakfast since I came to their other location outside of The Strip once before with family and enjoyed it. Sadly, I couldn't say the same this time for this location. Both the service and the food ended up being more lackluster than what I remembered it to be from the other location we visited in the past. 

We came on a Wednesday morning and it was decently busy but not too crowded; we were seated within 20 minutes for four. However, we waited for what felt like nearly another 20 minutes before our server even came to greet us for the first time when we were already ready to order and eat. Afterwards, the wait for the food also felt incredibly long which we weren't too grumpy about since they did have a lot of customers. I was just disappointed that our server was often nowhere in sight. 

The food came in huge portions which is what they're known for. I got the Texas Ranchero Benedict and tried some of my friend's Meatloaf Hash as well. Definitely preferred the hash over the benedict - note that they serve their benedicts with scrambled eggs instead of poached. I didn't really like the Texas Ranchero since it felt like there were maybe four spoonfuls of chorizo along with bits of eggs here and there. It was full of crispy fried chips more than anything. The hash was a much better mix of meat, veggies, and eggs. 

I think the food really depends on what you get, the Sage Fried Chicken options are usually pretty good and the hashes as well. I personally don't think I would get a benedict from here again if I do come back since I love poached eggs in benedicts and the scrambled eggs kind of ruined the magic for me."
2388,Hash House A Go Go,3,Last two times I went to Vegas I came here. Both times it took forever to get our food. The waiter kept on disappearing on us. The Chicken fried eggs Benedict is worth the wait and a huge plate too. Both times I had to share with someone or I would have been in a food coma. It has a good crunch and spice mixture.
2389,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is HUGE! I recommend sharing a plate, Believe me when I say it's big enough for 3 people a plate. We tried the chicken Benedict and chicken and waffles and both were delicious but very heavy. 
The service was great, our waitress was very quick and kind. Just be prepared it is always packed and always busy. We waited 40 min to be seated but it was worth the experience. You"
2390,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have been here half a dozen times and the only complaint i have is that the restaurant was short staffed twice when we went, causing a long wait at the bar even though we were the only ones sitting at it. However, they had this one server that was an absolute rockstar and always took great care of us, while juggling so many other tables. I wish i knew his name bc we Will be back to see if he's working when we visit this weekend! This restaurant was the only enjoyable part of our stay at the linq. My favorite dish so far is their super huge pancake with apples baked into it!! I dare you to try and eat a whole one... :)"
2391,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really great food, 
Would have given 5 stars but the hostess was a little confused to say the least. We stood and waited a good 10 min before we were even greeted.  
 A couple employees walked by in that time and didn't say anything or seem to care they had guests waiting. 
There was 4 groups waiting for hostess. 
 The waitress also seemed to be pre occupied she was very nice and polite.  I felt rushed when ordering.  Over all a very good atmosphere and experience. The food was really good.  If it wasn't for a coupon my wife and I would have split her meatloaf there is so much food !!

My wife had the stuffed meatloaf and I had a burger. I don't remember what it was called. 
We took pictures if I can figure out how to post I will."
2392,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were on vacation with friends and this was our last morning to eat something other than a buffet.  We were told about this place by a friend in California and boy were we glad.  It was a wonderful breakfast dining experience.  The food was very good, huge portions and the waitress was EXCELLENT (I forgot her name though).  She was fun and knowledgeable and there for our every need.  All four of us were happy were our selections.  I ordered the Hash spinach mushroom scramble, which was a little dry, but when I ordered a side of the Chipotle sauce from the Andy's Man vs food dish it was perfect.  I asked for just a little bit of the sauce because it was a little dry, but they still charged extra for the sauce.  We also ordered the ""Andy's Man Vs Food"" breakfast which was delish, although crazy carb loaded with biscuits, mashed potatoes, angel hair pasta, fried chicken, bacon and more.  Our friends got the Mango Coconut pancake and also the French toast and they absolutely loved both dishes.  The coffee was hot and very good and constantly refilled as it should be at breakfast time.  I think everything was definitely a bit overpriced for breakfast with drink, tax and tip probably around $16-20 per person.  I will definitely eat here again the next time I come to Las Vegas, but next time I will share a dish with someone."
2393,Hash House A Go Go,4,"L and I were partying like rock stars on the strip.  Then all of a sudden midnight hunger pains began.  Of course, Yelp HELP!  The portions are HUGE, so L and I split a ham, spinach & cheddar farm scramble (scrambled eggs, ham, spinach, & cheddar cheese served with roasted potatoes and fresh fruit).  The server was awesome."
2394,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So, this is one in the series of reviews I'm throwing up there during my #transient-week adventure thru Southern Nevada and Arizona. There were several casualties.

The only casualty that came out of this place was my appetite. We came here after a pretty rough night of gambling and drinking and wanted a bomb place to grub on some food - so we came here on a recommendation of a friend that assured me this place was the shit. Let me tell you, if all his recommendations were this spot on, I maybe forced to push thru legalizing gay marriages. The portions were huge, so big in fact that I literally took half of it in a to-go box and munch on it while traveling to Phoenix. Not only are the portions are huge, but they're f***ing fantastic. My breakfast was absolutely to die for. Just as if all that wasn't enough, the culinary geniuses behind the counter made the presentations gorgeous - I mean, i almost didn't want to eat my breakfast, it was that perdy! I guess my only real beef with this place is after managing to pick ourselves off the floor and actually manage to get into the joint for breakfast, was that the place was packed. I mean, ridiculously stupid long wait packed. We ended up lounging around by the bar and tiger pounced on seats as they came open.

Sorry to the couple that we elbowed to the face to get those seats. This boy came hungry! Hope your chin heals."
2395,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is over sized so make sure you share with someone. Food is great and not greasy
2396,Hash House A Go Go,5,Delicious. .. but huge portions.  Share them.  I had waffles with bacon. So good.  Friends had scramble with potatos....excellent!  The other had sage chicken man v food. It was huge!  Had a little kick to it. .. but really good.  Get there early. ... there was a huge line to get in.
2397,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great Food w a lots of flavor and a excellent service. ..Kye did great ...first time here but definitely not the last one
2398,Hash House A Go Go,4,"As I was researching breakfast places prior to a Vegas trip, Hash House A Go Go came up plenty of times, so we gave it a try for a Friday morning breakfast.  They're located on the 2nd floor of the Linq, just off the casino floor.  It can get really crowded - we made it over for a (relatively) early breakfast, maybe around 8:30 or so and only had to wait a few minutes before being seated, but on our way out the entrance to the restaurant was packed with people waiting for the next table.

3 of us split the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and a hash with mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes and spinach.  The chicken was a little on the dry side by itself, though it was great once the maple syrup was added, and the bacon waffles were delicious.  I really liked the hash too, the ingredients were tasty and the potatoes were cooked perfectly.  Portion sizes were huge, the three of us were stuffed, and the total bill came out to just over $30 - not unreasonable for a good breakfast anywhere, and a particularly good deal for a place in the middle of the Strip.

Hash House a Go Go was a great place for breakfast - decent food and ginormous serving sizes coupled with good service.  Go early or be prepared for a wait, but the food is definitely worth it."
2399,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash house a go go is my FAVORITE place for breakfast.  I deducted one star because I hold the one in SD as the benchmark and this place does not live up to SD.  The food, of course, is delicious.  The ambiance, however, is not as fun/decorative and the location is in dingy Imperial Palace with no cell service.  Realistically I say, 4.5 stars, rounded down.

Andy's sage fried chicken is large enough to share, however there is a sharing fee of $3!  We ordered a side of eggs to avoid the sharing fee.  Also, Christine K had the smart idea of ordering the chipotle sauce on the side and it made the meal taste that much lighter.  YUMMY!"
2400,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House has my favorite breakfast dish in town! It's the sage fried chicken benedict, and it's amazing. I get it with extra creamy chipotle sauce. I love this restaurant. The farmhouse decor is roomy and fun, and the service is always friendly and very accommodating."
2401,Hash House A Go Go,1,This place is terrible. The only reason why we came was b/c it was the only thing that was still opened and yelp gave it 4 stars. I'm not sure if those reviewers were all drunk or what. But we had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was completely tasteless. We had the #5 burger and it was just bad. The waitress was nice but we only saw her twice. Overall. We wish we had subway instead of this place. Do not come here.
2402,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best breakfast we had this week. Should have done it at the start of the trip... the size of the food is insane... probably could have eaten from it all week. And i would have enjoyed eating the rosemary benny all week.  Our waitress Kye was awesome.
2403,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Even though they were very busy (Sunday @11:30 AM) we were seated in 5-7 minutes. Granted we were a party of two. Drink order was taken right away and drinks came shortly after.  I had the sage chicken and waffles, it was more than enough food for 2-3 people. I am not much of a sage person, so the chicken was ok to me. If someone enjoys sage, you may like the chicken more than I did. Waffles had bacon in it, not bits but actual strips! The waitress was nice enough, but was very busy. Be prepared it does get noisy in here."
2404,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Horrible food!!!! Good to look at because of the large portions & the presentation but the food itself is discusting!!! Had a party of 11.....everyone was unimpressed!! One of my friends even referred to the chicken and waffles dish as ""gentrification chicken""!!! It was HORRIBLE. Not seasoned at all, but the little seasoning it did have was Rosemary & sage......lol....on FRIED CHICKEN!! Please stop!!! It was not AT ALL worth the hour wait!!"
2405,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Fantastic food! The only reason I'm giving a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because it took a long time to get our food. The restaurant was super busy, but we waited for over 45 min for our food. Once we got our food, it was wonderful! Not to mention the biggest plates of food we've seen! I definitely recommend sharing a dish!"
2406,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'm so basic and choose quality over quantity, so this place wasn't for me... but the rest of my party enjoyed their meal. We tried the chorizo plate, oatmeal, and the tractor breakfast with the huge buttermilk pancake. Ordered an orange juice and it was not very good, but the Bloody Mary was decent. The scrambled eggs were more watery than my preference and bland in flavor. Sausage was ok. 
I wish I would've just tried the chicken and waffles speciality since I probably won't willingly return again, but I'm glad we at least gave the place a shot. 

Service was friendly and quick. They have plenty of drink specialties which looks fun if you like trying different concoctions. Lots of energy in the large rooms and we were happy to be seated quicker with our diamond card service."
2407,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Been here before and loved it but today, I can't say the same. The food was okay. I got the chicken and waffles, the chicken was cooked well but the coating was soggy and falling off of it. The waffles were not crispy, delicious as I remember. My husband got burger #5 and it was good but again, buns didn't hold well. Service (Abby) was good, fast and fresh orange juice was fresh and yummy. I most likely wont be back next time I'm in town."
2408,Hash House A Go Go,2,Heard so many great things about this place. First stop for lunch decided to go to Hash house. It was really busy as expected. Only waited 15 minute to be seated but 30 min before we go our food. I ordered the chicken and waffles it came with a huge portion enough for two people but they give you one tiny thing of maple syrup. The guy who dropped off our food said we have to ask our waiter for more that he can't get it. After ten minutes we can't find out waiter I wave and ask a busser he looks at me ignores me and walks away. I let the host know and he said he's a busser he can't help. I didn't know that means ignore the customers Kirk you don't see them when I just needed maple syrup. Eventually I was able to get some syrup form the host but it was tinnier then the portion that came with it. Although my food was good my experience was so so I will not be returning back to this property.
2409,Hash House A Go Go,5,I don't have any complaints about this place. Food was perfect. The service was great. Drinks were tasty. The price was very generous considering the amount of food they serve. Me and my friend split the Sage Fried chicken Benedict (I posted a picture up) and we were beyond full. Two of the dishes the had were on Man vs Food and he wasn't lying. The dishes were perfect. Everyone should visit this place.
2410,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food huge portions easily shareable between 2 very hungry people or 3 moderately hungry people. I had the crab cake sandwich the flavor was amazing between the sweetness of the crab cake and the spiciness of the sauce. I wish for the price they had some lump crab meat in it instead of it being an obliterated breaded patty, but the flavor is definitely there. The service was awesome and the servers are really friendly it made the wait easier because they were packed and there was a bit of a wait for seating. From order to food being served was about 20min. They do have take out just call ahead and pick up in the bar."
2411,Hash House A Go Go,1,Overrated. Long lines. Long wait. Shoddy service. Food wasn't properly made. Not satisfied. Manager was nice. One waiter forgot his name was great the other one wasn't. I really think people should think long and hard before waiting in that line for mediocre food and service. Had to return two dishes how bad the food was. This was on a Sunday afternoon.
2412,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This was ok, I was a bit let down, wanted to like it more based on the reviews here, but just didn't feel it.  Maybe I was disappointed in what I ordered, biscuits and gravy.  My lady had the chorizo/jalapeno scrambler and that was better.  I don't know man, something about the food, looked industrial or processed to me.  Like they hit and button and GLOP it appeared on the plate.  Just didn't look very appetizing to me, even in the pictures here on Yelp.  A very loud place, but we were seated pretty quick for a party of four.  Drink orders took a long time, but our server was very nice and helpful, got no gripe there at all.  Very reasonably priced for Vegas and the portions are rather large, someone told me to split the portions, but my lady and I are tough, we can handle it! Think our tab was about 52 bucks for both meals and three drinks.  I might go back and try something different next time, just sorta average to be honest."
2413,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food and drinks....everything is massive!  They are the room service for the hotel as well.  The BBBBLT was perfect for refueling around 10PM.
2414,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Total insult to human, if u r a pig go there, food is served like you are a pig and your last meal on earth. What is the point of the giant size and no taste? Portions are gigaNtic, more than 3 people can  eat it . 
Food quality    Is zero , only the size is the drive. Go to a normal place to eat normal food that has food flavors, this is just multiple dishes on top of each other and zero quality. 
Total dissapointment."
2415,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First off, let's start with the location. This restaurant is located inside The Quad which smells like an ash tray and feels like a sauna. My contacts burned and dried out upon just walking to the elevator to get to the restaurant. 

Once we got inside, I was glad that the restaurant wasn't like the casino. While it was a little hot inside, it was nowhere near the level of stuffiness and humidity that the casino was on. We came around 6-7 o'clock and there was no wait at all. We were promptly seated and the server gave us good recommendations on what to get because it was our first time. 

The food came out and like everyone said the portions were huge! The plate was bigger than my head! I got the meatloaf and it was amazing! My other friends got the chicken benedict which they liked as well while my other friends got the Chicken & Waffles which they thought was a little dry. 

All in all, I'll definitely come back again! It's totally worth the money!"
2416,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Man the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. Fried perfect, a great flakey crust and the waffle had such a great flavor. The fried green tomatoes were spot on and I highly recommend getting the chicken salad added to them.. It was so flavorful"
2417,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Customer Service on point! Waitresses was super friendly and checked up on us every so often. Food was delicious and portion is enormous!!!! 

The chicken and bacon waffles is a MUST TRY!! Soooooo goooood."
2418,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The best and bigger burger i have ever ate. Great service, fresh meat, nice place. Greatest."
2419,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Where to start, I never heard of this place. I did not know it was famous. We arrived to Vegas early and a cousin wanted to go there. They arrived before us thus cutting down the hour wait time. The food is served in LARGE portions. I wish I knew this my children could never eat one pancake. I ordered the salmon scramble. I should have asked questions first I expected the salmon to be on the side but it was miniature bits in scrambled eggs. I had the mashed potatoes with it which was good vs. the has browns others had which were frozen potato squares. Now the husband ordered the fried chicken tower. He said the waffle with bacon cooked in it was amazing the chicken could have used some additional flavor."
2420,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The LINQ Hotel and Casino has Hash House a Go Go!!!  This is the place to go for a great breakfast.  The reasons for the full five stars?  We got seated quickly (because the place is pretty big), the two of us got one of those corner round super booths (great for people and food watching), our waiter was the best waiter that I had in quite a while.  He was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  After I ordered the ""Andy's sage fried chicken eggs Benedict""... our waiter said... ""Stop ordering right there... I'll bring an extra plate... ordering any more for you two would be a waste"".  Super value and it is fantastic seeing all these plates come out in prehistoric Fred Flintstones portions!!!  Let's be honest... not great for your waistline, but I can't deny the great taste of something when someone pulls out all the stops.  Even if you are not a big eater... come here to get a cup of coffee just to see some of the plates that come out.  We had a very good time here, left a hefty tip, and took a long walk afterwards."
2421,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was good. The Bloody Mary was delicious! There was a very long wait after we ordered.  The thing that was kind of weird, I noticed no one in the restaurant was eating.  We had all ordered and waiting for our food. Then after about ten more minutes the food was coming out quickly. All of the staff was bringing food. The only thing I could think of was possibly a cook/chef was late or missing.  It was all good. Our waiter was very nice. Kind of memorable. :)"
2422,Hash House A Go Go,5,Party in my mouth is how would describe the French toast. I died a little with each bite. It was THAT good!
2423,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is a good place to share a dish. Portions are ginormous and the service entertaining. Can be a huge wait on weekends but usually not a problem on weekdays. The sage chicken and waffles are satisfying, but left unfinished despite a two person assault."
2424,Hash House A Go Go,5,"All I can say is WOW!! 
The food was great very LARGE portions and it was very tasty food!! We enjoyed it for visiting Las Vegas! awesome job here"
2425,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Everything was great here. The service, the atmosphere, the time it took to get our food, the temperature of the food and especially the food itself."
2426,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Our experience here was very average. We had come here years ago and really enjoyed it but things have changed. We came here with some friends yesterday. We got the grilled cheese, BBBLT, ribs and crab cake sandwich. PORTIONS ARE HUGE!!
Our server was very nice! He gave us some recommendations on the food to try and was very helpful when we asked questions. Although, during the meal we didn't see him very much.
Our friends got the grilled cheese and the ribs. They said the grill cheese was good, the french fries were really good. Nice and crispy! But, the ribs were horrible.  The meet was very fatty and extremely tough. 
I had the BBBLT and my husband had the crab cake sandwich. The crab cake was very good and had great flavor. It was quite large and had a great crust.  The BBBLT had a ton of great bacon. The bread was so good! Except, it was so thick I couldn't even bite into it I had to take one of the pieces off. 
Presentation was nice. But I don't think we would be going back. It was lackluster compared to out prior experience."
2427,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My favorite kind of restaurant is one that takes something familiar and pumps up the flavor profile in a unique way, while still keeping the vibe casual and comfortable. Chego in Los Angeles is my favorite restaurant in the world for this reason, and what it does for Korean food, Hash House A Go Go does for breakfast staples.

Take whatever it is you enjoy for breakfast. They have a fresh twist on it that adds lots more flavor, and they give you a gigantic portion too. I got the corned beef hash - it came out with larger chunks of quality corned beef (instead of mushed together scraps), with swiss cheese to make it a combination of the usual breakfast staple with a Reuben twist. My wife got the Pecan blueberry pancake, and said it was the best pancake she's ever had.

Highest recommendation to go. I find it hard to believe a human being could walk away from here unhappy. One tip though - this location is at the Imperial Palace, so we went because it was on the strip. But if you have a car, or the means to get off the strip, go to another location if you can. The Imperial Palace is one of the more crowded, smoky, noisy, run down and depressing hotels you'll visit. The restaurant is still worth the trip if this is your only option (heck, I did it myself), but knowing better next time, I'll make the drive to the other location."
2428,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG,  unbelievable delicious.  Their chicken and waffles was the best ever. PS one will serve two people with left overs. Can't say enough.  Very eye appealing too. We will be back!!!  A+++"
2429,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Just had a plain Waffle, mushy in the middle, wasn't hot, pretty sure it was pre made. Couldn't finish it. Butter, syrup and coffee was good. I'll never go back there for breakfast."
2430,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had a very sweet waitress yesterday by the name of Abbie. She was very kind and explained and answered any of our questions about the menu. She was very straight forward about the portions size and my goodness I am still stuffed. Lol. The food was great, but the next time I go I will ask for Abbie to be my server. She is such a breath of fresh air. I think that anyone that can make you feel loved without knowing you, has a special gift. We will for sure be back."
2431,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great service and not too long of a wait. They told us the portions were big and they weren't lying! We got the sage fried chicken and another breakfast entree. Both were full of flavor and came in a timely manner. Their huge buttered biscuits with homemade jam and bacon waffles were my favorite parts of the meal. Looking forward to come back and try more bacon!
2432,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I will miss you Hash House a go go.  Our time was short, but well spent.  And now all i have is pictures to drool over.

Before eating here I read the review that keith a. did.  I noticed the waits are long. So when we got to Vegas and were planning everything out, I called down and spoke with someone about best times to come in.  He asked if I was going to be around mid-week and I said, ""Yep! Till Thursday!""  He said, ""Any day mid-week after 10:30 is generally no wait at all.""

I Called AGAIN on Wednesday morning to double check and the gentleman said there's no wait at all.  We got down there about 45 minutes later, and as said, we were promptly seated with no wait.  Our server was a really nice guy who was on top of his game.  Polite, Kind, and Friendly.  Three things most servers should practice!

My wife ordered a egg scramble that was decent sized, it came with a biscuit and she ordered a mimosa and said that all of it tasted really good.  I tasted the scramble, it had chicken, corn, eggs and cheese.  Maybe a few other things I cant remember but it tasted really fresh!

I got the Fried Chicken Bene!!! My eyes were HUGE with amazement at this insane looking mound of food that was put on my table.  I stared at it wondering how the hell do you eat this thing!?!?  After simply ""diving in"", I had a system going and it was going well!!! So many flavors colliding that I was very impressed.  The chipotle topping was a nice flavor added to everything else.  I saved some for that night being I was so stuffed and It was gone!!!  

If eating at this location, give them a call and see what the wait is, it'll help decided if you wanna come or not."
2433,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Definitely an experience I'm glad I had, but I gotta say the food was just average.  This restaurant is an advertisement for something like thisiswhyyourefat.com - portions are huge, the food is rich, but the ambiance is great and service was very attentive.  We went for dinner because when we came by for brunch, the line was down the long escalator that leads to this place

The biscuits we were greeted with at the beginning of our meal was probably the best thing we ate all night.  I had the grilled chicken and my friend had the chicken and waffles.  As you'd expect, both portions were huge.  My grilled chicken had the best flavor out of both dishes and was solid.  Unfortunately, the chicken to vegetable ratio was very off and in 3 bites, I had consumed all the vegetables on my plate.  But then again, you're not going to HHAGG to eat healthy!

My friend's chicken and waffles was disappointing.  The waffles were boring and the chicken dry.  We were really expecting more from one of their signature dishes.  

Bottom line, go and go hungry.  It's an experience.  Expect a crazy wait for brunch.  Eat an extra biscuit.  I might be back out of convenience as I have no real objection to this place, but probably won't go seeking it out."
2434,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Excellent choice for a birthday breakfast or a celebration or really any day of the week for that matter. At the recommendation of fellow Yelper, Sik. L. I checked out Hash House A Go Go. I went here on my birthday for breakfast and the food here is really good. Keep in mind that  the portions are insanely large, so you could potentially share a meal. I did not know this going in and I was totally shocked. My hubs and I both ordered waffle breakfasts. It ends up being a better deal in the end than getting items a la cart. 

We had a short wait of about 30 minutes on a early Wednesday afternoon. We were probably seated sooner than the in total time that we were actually quoted which is always great. If you haven't been to this specific location, it has a couple of separate dining areas and has a somewhat rustic feel. We were seated on the second area. This restaurant is located inside the casino so there is no natural lighting.

If you are in Vegas this is a great way to begin your day by getting  a good meal in your belly before partying. Can't wait to go back!"
2435,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place was our first stop after arriving in Vegas. My brother-in-law saw Adam Richman do a Man vs. Food challenge here.  Even that cue didn't prepare us from the mammoth meal we were about to have.

After about a 30-minute wait...this place had a line for days...we got a table in an empty party of the restaurant. They warned us that portions were big, but they were actually huge. I ordered the meatloaf hash which was pretty tasty, but I wasn't able to finish even half of it. I got a BLT Bloody Mary to go with it which was quite nice...never had bacon in my bloody mary before. This I highly recommend.

In total, there were 9 of us at the table that morning. I don't recall anyone finishing their meal. I asked the waiter what percentage of the patrons actually finished their plate of food. He said 1%. Freaking 1%.

This bothered me a bit. I understand the novelty with the huge portions, but we wasted a ton of food...and so did others at the tables around us.  

When you eat here, plan to share...and I'm not just talking two per entree...I'm talking 3-4...unless you can really put it away.

It's a fun place, the food is good, and service was attentive. But be sure to come hungry. In this case, food definitely won vs. me."
2436,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HOLY GIANT PANCAKE!!!
So delicious though!!

This is by far the best thing about the IP"
2437,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG!! Portions can get insane depending on what you get! My boyfriend and I had breakfast here before we left to head home to the Bay Area. He ordered the chicken pot pie and I had french toast. The chicken pot pie was enormous. He couldn't even finish it halfway. That's rare for him! I barely finished my french toast. My french toast wasn't huge, it just had a lot of sides. Service was great, although for breakfast you would have to wait about 30 min because it gets pretty packed. But if you can get in a lot sooner than that, that's even better! I want to come back and try their lunch menu next time."
2438,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place serves large portions of food. The quality of the food I had in my particular order was just so-so. The others I ate with seemed underwhelmed by their food also. It is a very busy and noisy place to dine with a semi-long hike to the nearest rest room. The wait staff was fine. Might be worth another look sometime but maybe pick a less busy and less noisy time of day, whenever that would be in Vegas."
2439,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Second time my husband and I have eaten at Hash House at the Quad and it was excellent!  We had breakfast the first time and the garlic mashed potatoes were amazing.  I'm a vegetarian and there were lots of choices on the menus, my husband is not and he as well had an abundance of choices! 

This time we went for dinner and again they didn't disappoint!  I had the squash risotto and my husband had the HH meat loaf. Everything was delicious as well as the tangerine mimosa and my husband's Bloody Mary was perfection! 

Now, I really want to commend our excellent server Scott!  Let me tell you that young man deserves a raise!!  He was so knowledgeable about the menu and all things Hash House and that's because he's been a long time and loyal employee!!  He was so friendly attending to our table and really made the second time there our favorite!  

Give that young man a raise Hash House A Go Go he is an asset to your restaurant!!"
2440,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One of the most popular restaurant in Las Vegas for breakfast options, Hash House A Go Go is open 24/7. It's a carbs wonderland because the portions are HUGE. I recommend sharing with a friend because you will most likely not be able to finish a plate in one sitting. 

The wait time for seating is exceptionally long during morning hours, so go later on in the day if you want to avoid the lines. I went at 2am and, while it was still popping, (Vegas never sleeps) there was no wait at all. 

I got the Farm Scrambles with bacon, avocado, onion and swiss. The food was delicious, the scrambled eggs and mashed potatoes were great and full of flavor. Fresh fruits and a biscuit with strawberry jam are also included.

Prices are $$ because, Vegas. However, their portions makes it worthwhile, you'll definitely be stuffed here! If you're in Vegas, Hash House A Go Go is one of the top places for a foodie to try."
2441,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow!  Heard about it!  Couldn't believe it! Experienced it!  It's all true!  

Let's start off by,  no wait at all. As we walked in we noticed the variety of food & the huge portions.

We both were hungry, and not vegan sad face.  We tried & we couldn't, any how! Twisted farm house here! 

I ordered the recommended fried chicken Benedict.  First off this particular meal can easily feed two people.  

The chicken breast was tender, was on top of a fresh biscuit, hearth bacon, omg amazing mash Parmesan potatoes & scrambled eggs.  The sauce had a slight spiced taste. This meal was amazing! 

The spouse settled on a basic breakfast & was not disappointed. Not to mention he also ate my chicken. 

Loved the mimosa in the leg lampshade.  Great souvenir.  I especially loved the Carmel macchiato, with Baileys.  

I can not say enough nice things about the food or service. 

Tawney our waitress had the best attitude, smile, tips & service. We never had to ask for refills!

You definitely do not want to skip this place!"
2442,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This was my second time here and I got to say, it changed my mind. Considering one was for dinner and the other for breakfast, it really didn't matter. Good is good and I want to go again. It loses a star because our food arrived Luke warm so it was a bit of a let down. Other then that I was happy with the place and will get a return visit in the near future."
2443,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After reading all of the wonderful reviews for Hash House a Go Go, this was first on our list for Las Vegas. We were staying at the MGM Grand, and it looked like this was about a mile down the strip so we chose to walk. 

The weather was grand, and the walk nice. We stopped along the way to do some shopping and eventually ended up at the restaurant. I had the Roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary. The portions are large. Of the various ingredients, the asparagus was outstanding. The rest was fair.

Service was excellent, although the server seemed a little contrived and over the top. But, she was nice. 

We tried it, they just opened one in Chicago, but I think that I was not impressed enough to go out of my way to try the one here. Sorry."
2444,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yummy eggs with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes and basil. Their biscuits were surprisingly good for being away from the south. The guys in our group loved the beer in a bag and bacon combo. The place was quite busy but everyone enjoyed their meals overall."
2445,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was insane. My compadre got a MASSIVE sage fried chicken and waffles.....biggest I've ever seen. (I'm not sure the herb was sage though, might have been rosemary). Other than the possible herb mix-up I was very impressed. The breading was very good (shoutout to corn flakes) and paired perfectly with the waffles - did I mention they were filled with bacon? No I didn't. The waffles had bacon in them. Amazing. My simple healthy egg white scramble with bacon looked inferior compared to the tower of chicken that was in front of it."
2446,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were only in Vegas for 2 days and managed to eat here twice. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. Like everyone says the portions are huge so share if possible. We got biscuits and gravy and it was very good. We were there on Thanksgiving and had their Thanksgiving special and chicken and waffles. The turkey was very moist (believe it was deep fried turkey) and it had all of the fixings. Our eyes were bigger than our stomaches, wish we could have ate more!"
2447,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Thursday night, 10pm dinner, it's 105 outside and we walk right in and immediately  seated.  Right away we feel that their AC is not quite up to par. It feels like it's 90+ inside and EVERYBODY has got their menus and using them as fans trying to stay cool.  When we asked our waitress bout it, she shrugged it off and states ""that's the norm here"",  We toughed it out because we wanted to see what all the hoopla was about.  Well we were not let down.  We shared the Chicken n Waffles and we were not disappointed.  It was plenty good and the sage and slaw gave it a distinct/delicious flavor, it was like ""wow"", that's good.  We were both pleased, but they have got to do something about that Air Conditioning, or lack of AC.  Hostess and Waitress were great.  You've Got to give this place a try, but be warned and Be ready to eat, or share..."
2448,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The chicken and waffles. Bring your appetite... there is wayyyyy too much food, hence why it's a bit pricier than your typical breakfast. I haven't had any other meal here because I'm so hooked on my chicken, bring others and do a sampling of different menu items."
2449,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place! I always get the famous man versus food and chicken and waffle! The portions are huge! Great price.
2450,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had heard about this place either from a friend or on the Food Network, I forget.  All I knew is the food is unhealthy and delicious and it was in our hotel at the Flamingo.

Got there and we asked for a table for 5.  The guy said everyone had to be there so we just grabbed some drinks at the bar.  Had the huckleberry sin which was good but a little tart.

We got seated and they gave us the menus and took our drink orders. My friend and I decided to share the Kokomo, which was a meatloaf sandwich and a side of sweet potato fries.  We wanted the biscuits and gravy, but that wasn't an option for a side.  They also charge extra for ranch!  Still, food was good.  My second drink, which was the watermelon kiwi lemonade, was alvery delicious. 

Our friend had ordered the snickers bread pudding and they warned him it would take 20-25 mins.  But when it came, it was deliciously warm and gooey. 

Overall this place is great and has a fun vibe.  Food is yummy but not something you can eat too often. Vegas is the perfect location when you're either drinking or hung over the next morning."
2451,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A must eat resto!

1. Waiting time approx 10- 15 mins- & that's almost lunch time on a Thurs! Hello, in Vegas?
2. Food served on time- huge servings- good for 2! I ordered beef medium rare w mashed potato & house salad w cucumber dressing on the side. I hav to box some to go!
3. Billy, our server- deserved to be recognized! Warm, friendly, accomodating- reaches out to customers.
4. Price overall is okay- it's the quality that matters."
2452,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I had high hopes for this place after finding out The Linq doesn't have a buffet but I was disappointed....

I got the Hash House Salad which really had no taste.  I also had the corned beef hash and I was expecting the regular breakfast hash but it was corned beef like at St Patrick's Day.  It was good but not at all what I was expecting.

They aren't kidding when they say portions are large so take care when ordering appetizers and whatnot."
2453,Hash House A Go Go,4,Excellent. Tons of food!!! Highly recommend. Don't count calories when you go. Just enjoy!!!
2454,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After some poking around Yelp to find a lunch spot, I stumbled on this great place which was across the street from my hotel (Caesar's) on the strip. The menu looked right up my alley, and it didn't disappoint. I was concerned when I got to the entrance and saw a bunch of people waiting. Sure, it's a sign that the food must be good, but I was hungry. Well, I was psyched when the hostess pointed me to bar seating. I love bar seating when eating on my own (friends were working a conference). I ordered the chicken & waffles and my only complaint is that my belly couldn't fit more than half of that goodness!
Well done with the grub and service.
I'm psyched that there's one closer to home in Reno. I'll get there soon.
-pat"
2455,Hash House A Go Go,5,big portions!...yummy entrees---all can share!
2456,Hash House A Go Go,5,"All I can say is WOW!  When you see the generous portions and try the food... you're gonna say the same thing ""WOW""!!!

This place gets very packed and you might end up waiting anywhere between 20-45 mins for a table, but it's totally worth the wait.  If there is an open chair at the booth, you're welcome to sit there and have your meal.  My wife ordered the Chicken & Waffles and I had the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and both dishes were OFF DA HOOK DELICIOUS!!!  We're coming back for sure!"
2457,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here on a Saturday morning with about 10 friends. It's crazy busy but worth the wait. You won't be seated until your entire party is there so I suggest that everyone gets there early! 

The quality of food and the HUGE portions is the reason this place is well known. I ordered the Tractor Combo. Came with two eggs, ham, and your choice of waffles, flapjacks or French Toast. I opted for the waffles and was not disappointed! I got 4 massive waffles with my order!! I'm about that waffle life and this one was cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside and like fluffy pillows as it melts in your mouth! A little syrup goes a long way as the batter has some sweetness to it plus a generous slab of butter is much appreciated. The ham was tasty! Seasoned great. And my eggs were cooked over easy per my request. My friends shared the famous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and let me take a bite. All the YAAAS! I see why it's so famous. The crunchy chicken, bacon mashed potato, biscuit & sauce were amazing! This dish is massive. I know I wouldn't be able to finish it on my own so if you have the appetite, go for it! Also tried a bit of the steak from my friend's Steak and Eggs. The steak was seasoned just right and cooked to my friend's request.

Service was so-so. Our waitress was curt but quick. She definitely hustled. Got our orders out quickly & handled our check fast as well. She did grumpily take our picture. It turned out cute so no serious complaints on service. 

The only thing I had to knock a star off was the restaurant itself. It felt cramped and it was HOT & MUSKY AF. They needed the air on in there especially with so many people crammed in. The staff was running around constantly. Felt busy and not relaxing like when I normally dine out. 

I'd still return if I was on this side of the strip. The food was too good to not enjoy again!

Fun fact, you can take your alcoholic drinks to go because duh, it's Vegas!"
2458,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Thanks but NO thanks. Support our troops...yeah NO! In Vegas for a girls birthday getaway. Party of 5. Hash House A Go Go was highly recommended and we were staying at the Linq Hotel so extra convenient. Looking forward to an amazing day on the strip we enjoyed an admittedly delicious breakfast. When getting our check we asked if they offered a military discount. Yes, we do. Give him our ID cards and off he goes to get manager approval. Comes back to apologize that unfortunately the discount ONLY applies to the Active Duty member. NOT to spouses or veterans. FYI, we serve too. But the kicker and ultimate spoiler of the day was that 2 of our party were widows of military members who died while serving our nation. What these ladies wouldn't give to have their husbands there with them to be able to show their ID card to get said discount. After they broke down in tears at the slap in the face reminder, we spoke with the manager whose first words were to defend the policy stating it was not his decision but the owners. Begrudgingly he offered to give us the discount anyway but we'd already paid our bill. If we'd complained about the food I'm sure as the manager he'd have had no problem comping our meal or taking the item off the bill but God forbid we get a 10% discount for serving as a military spouse. Only 1% of the US population serves in the military. I don't think offering a military discount to ALL who serve would break the bank, especially considering the cost of the meal. As good as the food was, I won't be returning. Better be careful who you're speaking to. You never know what that someone's been through and completely ruin what would've otherwise been a great day. Either support ALL military members, families, and veterans or don't do it all. Never forget that all gave some and some gave all."
2459,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So this was place was crazy packed but we got in and served right away. Probably the most efficient wait system. The waiter was super friendly and made great recommendations. I was a little worried about not getting full and I was definitely wrong! There was more food than I can even think about. It was really tasty and there was so much of it. The food was not the greatest I've ever had but the presentation, the service and sheer amount of food made this place a winner!"
2460,Hash House A Go Go,5,What can I say?! This place is over the top! Everything we ordered was perfect.  HUGE portions and great prices.  It's a must try.  I have to go back!
2461,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Super awesome place! Great choices!!!! Super fun to look at the menu.

But the reason why I can't give it a 5 Star is because the actual taste of all our food didn't deliver. Just didn't meet our expectations. But it was still pretty good (4/5). So I would recommend this for its wide variety of selections, great presentation and great service."
2462,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HHaGG is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. With the crowds, it would others love it too. My favorite is breakfast for the food or happy hour for the drinks and deeply discounted bar food.

The staff is amazing. I always tip well given how much nonsense anyone who lives in Vegas has to endure."
2463,Hash House A Go Go,1,"NO QUALITY. Avoid this place, unless you are looking for huge portions and cheap prices, though for what....I have no clue!"
2464,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Even though it was a busy time of the day the service was still amazing! Also the food was so good. Definitely big enough to share with one or two other people depending on how hungry you are.

One thing I loved about this place was that we were all pretty sad that we didn't finish our food because the portions were so huge but we were informed that the food that doesn't get eaten goes to animal shelters! That made me so happy to hear. 5 stars in my book just for that!"
2465,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Open 24/7, which is perfect for Las Vegas! Hash House is located a short escalator ride up in the Quad Hotel. We came here on a Friday night after dancing, and there was a short 5 minute wait for a table when we arrived around 2:30am. The restaurant was definitely busy at that time, but it got busier since there was a small group of people waiting by the time we left. We ordered:

-Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower (Drizzled w/Hot Maple Reduction, Fried Leeks, $17.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=uIJCVxwPmefuV6tEmz_nDA#uIJCVxwPmefuV6tEmz_nDA): The fried chicken was really good, and the waffle was also good, although Roscoe's is better. Gigantic portion, and recommended.
-Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (w/Maple Reduction, 2 Eggs, Bacon, Mashed Potatoes, Biscuit, $16.99, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=uIJCVxwPmefuV6tEmz_nDA#MP5QbTrv_OdX4jHovWw7Pw): Another gigantic portion. There were a lot of flavors going on here, and they drown everything in sauce, but it's good in that ""I can feel my arteries clogging up"" way. Definitely worth trying once!

For 4 girls, two dishes were more than enough, and we still had leftovers even though we were super full. They had a ton of other items on the menu, so I will have to come back to try other dishes. Service was ok, but not super attentive, which isn't surprising. I was disappointed that we didn't get any of the biscuits that are complimentary if you come for dinner."
2466,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Got the Man vs Food favorite, Sage Fried Chicken with mashed potates, biscuts, etc. It'll be $25 after tip, but it's ginormous. Dish easily must've weighed 2lbs. Girl next to me was full after 4-5 bites. I got about 3/4 through it. This can easily feed 2 people. 

I would suggest people hop over to the bar seating to skip the 45 min line. Some couples did it and we were happy to scoot one seat over for them."
2467,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Definitely my favorite breakfast place to eat on the strip. I've been eating here for the last 6 years or so before when the Quad was the Imperial Palace. The staff from my experience is always on point. Not only does my server check on me, but so do busboys and managers. Service is always a plus here from experience. I have eaten everything on the menu from the breakfast side already and can't tell you a bad one. This place is known traditionally for their hash and eggs dishes with the side of fluffy big pancakes. The highlights here for me are the steak and eggs with the cheese cooked inside the steak, the breakfast cheese quesadilla. the fried chicken and waffles with the bacon cooked inside the waffle itself and of course the signature Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (Man vs. Food). All the food is flavorful because this place puts it's own twist to each dish. The portions are epic, definitely come here early eat, and take home your leftover for lunch. The official dishes here average between $15-$22 dollars for basically 2 meals of your day.  Located centrally on the strip. A definitely can't go wrong spot for epic breakfast."
2468,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When you first see the prices on the menu, as with anything on the Vegas strip, then seem high. However, you get plenty of food, portion size, for more than just yourself! 

Open 24/7, this place is a definite breakfast/lunch/dinner/late dinner spot. The service is nice, the security is cool and most important, the food is great!"
2469,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We had a great experience just as we did the first time we ate here on vacation last year. The wait time was only 25 minutes even though it was crazy busy. We had a wonderful server that was attentive and fast. My husband and I shared the fried chicken Benedict - a MUST try. Portions here are enormous so we always share a plate (keep that in mind while ordering). I also ordered a caramel latte and it was really good. We'll be back next time we are in Vegas, this Hash House is wayyyyy better than the one we have in San Diego."
2470,Hash House A Go Go,4,Located inside Harrah's and open 24 hrs. Great atmosphere and very nice servers/bartenders. Huge portions.
2471,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food is awesome, portions are absurdly huge, and the service is usually on point. That said, this is my go-to spot for a 1pm breakfast after a serious Vegas hangover, the only complaint I have is that the music is obnoxiously loud and has a nasty effect of intensifying the hangover...still worth a 5 star though. Definitely worth a visit if you've never checked it out!"
2472,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I just don't like it.  I have been forced to eat at this location and the ""M resort"".  I have tried to like it too.  I just don't like the menu or the dÃ©cor or the flavors of the food.  Something is off about it. I tried my sons bacon waffle it was ok.  And that's being nice.  They don't have ranch dressing I think that is weird.  They only have a cucumber ranch.  which doesn't go good over cheesy scrambled eggs.  The hamburger meat bugs me, they need to put spices in there meat.  The chicken waffles have that huge piece of Sage on top.  It's weird. They don't provide salt and pepper at the tables you have to ask for it.  I asked the waiter 4 times for salt and pepper & gave up, because he wouldn't bring it.  It's 24/7 I guess if your starving that's a good thing."
2473,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Open 24/7, huge portions that are good for sharing just choose wisely, friendly & fast service, wide variety on the menu (s'mores mocha was delicious) conveniently located on the 2nd floor of the LINQ hotel.

Cons: What in the name of unseasoned Chicken is this?!  (We ordered both the sage fried chicken Benedict + sage fried chicken & waffles). I couldn't believe that this chicken is so popular, but we live in New Orleans so maybe this is how they do it here. No ma'am. So much breading and not worth the price. I mentioned the dry chalky chicken to our server, she ignored me like she couldn't believe it was true. Meh."
2474,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food was great! Just make sure you go with a huge appetite because they don't play around with their portion of food! Lol the watermelon drink was delicious! Will be going back when I go visit Las Vegas again!
2475,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Brown sugar banana flapjack is very very good. It's also pretty big, in a matter when we shared it as a couple and couldn't finish it... Service nice as well and prices are pretty standard for vegas
Would definitely recommend this place!"
2476,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Chicken n Waffles were excellent. Only nitpick is chicken was a bit dry. Friendly, efficient service. Would go back."
2477,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've been here several times over the years but this time I wanted to try something different other than my favorite order of Sage chicken.  I decided to get the Tractor with French toast!  I regret doing it because the french toast was not what I expected.  It lacked flavor, I hardly tasted any cinnamon.  If it wasn't for the syrup, I wouldn't have ate it at all.  I was just left with so much bread.  Surprisingly the bacon wasn't to my liking either this time.  My 4 stars on this review is not based on this recent experience but rather an average of all the times I've been here which has been at least 4 times.  I think next time, I will stick with the sage chicken; if it ain't broke, don't fix it!!!!"
2478,Hash House A Go Go,4,"5/13/17 server Cherish was kool like my BLT Mary w/Ketel One (bacon, lettuce and tomato with giant toast!).. very relaxing! Fried Green Tomatoes scrumptious plus I ate Steak & Egg cooked med. Mmmmm. Yes, there was a wait but I sat at thee bar which wasn't a disappointment :)"
2479,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I came here right around 12 midnight and was not happy. At first everything seemed pretty good, friendly service walking in and smiles everywhere. But, I guess that's where it ends. After we ordered,  it took almost 30 minutes to get our food which is surprising since we only ordered a salad and a basic breakfast. And the place wasn't even busy. As I took a bite of my breakfast I can tell the food was sitting out for while as it was cold. I'm not a picky eater at all, but how can it be so bad for place that got great reviews.
Also, I noticed that two guest came in at least 10 mins after I did, ordered, ate, and left before we got our food. 
First impressions are a lot to me and this place is a HOUSE OF NO GO FOR ME"
2480,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You can always win big @ Hash House!! Love this place!

Always come back for breakfast here and feel like a happy high roller.

Food is awesome, service is pleasant, decor is crazy fun. 

OVERALL: Great Vegas experience every time!!"
2481,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Big portions AND good food??? This place is known for it's very big portions. We decided to stop by before we left to go back home. We arrived at 930 and only waited about 5 minutes before getting seated (this is a first). There were maybe 3-4 other groups waiting at that time. This place is 24/7 now!!

The drinks are pretty pricey. Fresh squeezed juice can get up to $7 and a their coffe drinks to $8. I opted for their watermelon kiwi lemonade..doesn't it just sound delicious?? This was $5.50 and so refreshing. My friend ordered the hazelnut latte, which was also very delicious. It's not too sweet and the whip cream on top is so yummy. Maybe they do have a reason for pricey drinks! 

It took us awhile to finally order our food because there are so many choices...and so little stomach room. I ended up ordering the Corned Beef Hash. This came with corned beef, onion, swiss on top of crispy potato chunks, 2 eggs, and a bisquit. It was a pile of cheesy beefy starchy goodness. My only complaint was that I asked for the eggs to be cooked over medium well but.. they were pretty much cooked through. I like the white to be cooked, but the yolk still runny.   

My friend ordered the Chorizo Hash and this came with chorizo, cheddar cheese, jalapeno, and tomatoes on top of crispy potato chunks, 2 eggs and a bisquit. I had tried this before on another visit and recommended it to my friend. There's just the right amount of heat from the jalapenos and not too greasy from the chorizo. Very delicious. She ordered her eggs the same way, and it came out perfect! 

Service was good. We didn't wait long when we requested something. Out waiter was very nice! When we finished eating and walked out.. (around 11) there were SSO MANY people and the wait was so long. Try and come early.. avoid lunch rush hour!!"
2482,Hash House A Go Go,5,Everyone loves this place and had become a mainstay in Vegas. The portion sizes are great and the spices they use on the breakfast items taste great! Best breakfast in town
2483,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best breakfast in Vegas. A must if you're like me and love breakfast food. Sage fried chicken and waffles is amazing, as is the french toast and massive pancakes."
2484,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I went because I had to try the famous chicken and waffles. I was definitely not disappointed, the waffles have bacon inside and it's rosemary chicken! FREAKING AMAZING! I will say you have to be prepared because the portion size is no joke, I would recomend sharing this plate unless you are up for a challenge."
2485,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Tried this place one more time, and I'm so glad I did. We discovered the chicken pot pie and it was the best one I've ever had! Well-seasoned, flavors were multidimensional, and just plain tasty!

The portion is humongous though! Honestly the portions here are huge. One entree is enough for two guys or four little Asian girls. lol 

Wonderful service! Without our server, we would not have discovered this wonderful dish! For that I'm forever grateful!"
2486,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always a must place eatery when in Vegas. I can't count the number of times we've been here, but every time, the service has been amazing. The food speaks for itself with ginormous portions. Trust me you can share if you want too. Breakfast is the best here."
2487,Hash House A Go Go,5,It's busy but very well organized. Be patient and you will be rewarded! Service is great and the food is unlike anything I've had before (in a very good way).
2488,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Absolutely huge portions. Ordered a Flap Jack. I was concerned there was only one to the order, but felt it might be OK because I didn't have a lot of time to spend eating breakfast. Had a Grand Canyon tour to get to.
It was a giant Flat Jack or pancake. I was only able to eat about 1/4 of it partly due to the denseness of the pancake. It definitely wasn't a light fluffy pancake. The texture was not that great either. 
I would have preferred a pancake that was half this size and much more lighter/fluffier. And...if the color was lighter, that would make the presentation much better. It was a weird dark brown color. Kind of expecting it to have a chocolate flavor due to the color of it."
2489,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came & ate here after work one night, really convenient that they're open 24 hours! You don't pay much for HUGE portions, but those are about the only perks. The food itself could be better. My chicken & waffles filled me up & I had a lot to take home, but the chicken could have more seasoning. The waffles had super good bacon baked inside, but aside from that I feel like they focused so much on the large portion that they forgot about flavor."
2490,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've seen pictures ,heard about it  on the news, but nothing will prepare you for the food that will be placed in front of you. I ordered Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon stuffed Waffles (Glory). Let me start by saying that this dish was a work of art. It was so perfectly stacked and the smell coming from my plate was addicting. I slowly  pulled everything apart so my plate can be organized  without embarrassing myself when I got ready to eat it. I wanted to dive in immediately. My chicken was crunchy on the outside, nice and moist on the inside with unique flavors coming from everywhere. My Bacon stuffed Waffle (my two for one) was perfection,there was a  nice crust on the Waffle and the Bacon had a nice crunch to it also this was a perfect bite and the combination was genius. The maple syrup added was warm and smooth and the service was attentive and memorable. Hash House A Go Go is a great place for breakfast. Check it out!
AW"
2491,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Dont waste your time or money on this restaurant. We paid over $35 for 2 meals and the food was disgusting. Not sure why people rave over this spot..they must be drunk LOL 

We went for breakfast and we were quickly seated as the restaurant wasnt very busy. We ordered the chicken hash and the portion is huge.  I have to say it was the most disgusting breakfast I have ever eaten.  

Our first bite was full of chicken fat.  Then the asparagus wasnt cooked and they included the lovely stalky part that should be cut off.  The biscuits come out cold which is probably why they want to upsell you the warm gravy. The waitress never asked us how our meal was, saw that we both didnt even touch our food and didnt offer a replacement.  Maybe the lunch is better but the Linq has a small breakfast shop around than corner that is cheaper and tastes much better."
2492,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is bigger and better than when I was here in November. I wasn't crazy because the bartender confirmed that they grew my 25%. There's more room and therefore they can seat/feed more people at any given time. The catch is there will always be a 90 minute wait for breakfast/brunch. 

My fiancÃ©  was impressed when I bypassed the hostess and went straight to the bar.  YES WE JUST WALKED IN AND SAT DOWN! Trade secrets don't tell your friends. I ordered a white wine spritzer because I'm in Vegas and on vacation. He topped it off with rum. Delicious! Since I need to start getting ready for the biggest day in my life I ordered the healthy starter. It was good and had more flavor once I doused it with picante sauce. I still ordered the worlds largest and softest biscuit. It came with fresh preserves. Baby steps...

Being from the Midwest I enjoyed the different tastes of the fruit that came with my meal. It was my fiancÃ©e first time eating here despite the fact that we have one in Chicago. He ordered the chicken and waffles. Made it 3/4 of the way through. Wants to visit back home now. Guess that means it's a winner in his book!"
2493,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was my favorite dining experience during my trip to Vegas!

The portions are GYNORMOUS, so come hungry and with friends.  We ordered the meatloaf sandwich and the chicken and waffles and split both entrees to get a taste of both.  The meatloaf was well seasoned and moist with a lovely sauce decorating the edge of the plate and the  inside of my mouth.  The chicken and waffles were presented towering high with a steak knife holding it all together.  They were all complimented by brown bag dressed PBR's... always a class act. 

Great place to try good food in Vegas.  But be prepared to wait 40 min+.  You won't be sorry though!"
2494,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was in a party of 3 and when we arrived we were told a 20-25 min wait...no problem as I figured there would be a wait. We went downstairs to gamble for about 10 minutes and then came back up and waited. After a total of 30 minutes I went up to ask how much longer and they told me they tried calling us. Well I waited for 20 minutes and heard nothing so they obviously called within the first 10 minutes. Normally that would be great but given that I was told 20-25 minutes I figured I could go downstairs where there were seats to wait. I don't understand why they weren't using the paging system either. That was frustrating but not a deal breaker. 

After seating us when I asked we then sat there for 10+ minutes without a single person coming over to greet us. I had to stop a gentleman who wasn't even our server. 

I ordered my burger with no avocado and sure enough it came on the burger. 


The food was good, the portions are huge but the prices reflect it. I usually don't say bad things but I was frustrated with the lack of organization within the restaurant. I won't be returning."
2495,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I saw this place on man vs food and so I had to try it and I did! ... and I LOVE the food here!! It is soooo yummy!! The sizes are also HUGE!! I had the same dish that Adam Richman ate on Man vs food. The fried chicken was cooked well, crispy and juicy. The potatoes were good and everything just blended together so well. I was only able to eat half the plate!! The prices are also very reasonable and with the plates being so big, you can always split it too. I also ordered the smores coffee and even that was in a giant cup! The melted marshmallows on top were a bit sweet, but when you mix it with the coffee, it's good. The guy even made it extra strong for me as I requested. The servers were nice and the lines do get long. However, if there are open seats at the bar and you have a smaller party, the bar area works with minimal wait. I can't wait to eat here again!"
2496,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food: 4*
Service: 3*
Price: 3*

After an almost 45 minute wait, at 9am on a Sunday, I don't believe this place is all it's hyped up to be or worth their often ridiculous wait times. 

Food: LARGE portions, overly garnished, but not as great as I had hoped for and read about. I got the chicken and waffles which was over powered by the sage in the batter of the chicken and the crispy fried green onions that covered the entire meal. The fried chicken was not crispy what's so ever, a complete let down while the inside was still moist. Cocktails were great, once they became cocktails. The Benedict was good, but spicy and seasoned so don't expect any hollandaise here! 

Service: Once our name was called and we fought the crowd to the front, we were walked to the back of a restaurant for our hostess to ask us to wait there, standing, in the middle of some tables full of other patrons. After a couple minutes of this she came back and apologized that ""our"" table had accidentally been sat with another party on mistake and we waited another 10 minutes until officially sat. One other issue we ran into was ordering their specialty (alcoholic) drinks and having them come virgin?? We had to ask our waiter then to have them fixed when we clearly had ordered some of their house drinks. 

Price: For the service hiccups, long wait times, and just satisfactory food I definitely believe it is a little over priced unless there is something here you absolutely love. For our group, one person and a regular beverage/coffee came to about $33 before tip and one person and a cocktail came to about $44 before tip. I get it's Vegas and the location alone is pricey, but I don't see myself coming back for a $30 breakfast here."
2497,Hash House A Go Go,5,Portions are HUGE and filling so be ready to eat. The food aromas were one of a kind and my chicken and waffles were flavorful. They have a creative drink menu and of course I couldn't leave without Hash House Mimosa Leg
2498,Hash House A Go Go,5,"There really isn't a good reason  to give this place anything less than 5 stars.  People complain that it is too expensive... but the portion size is completely equivalent to what you pay.  In addition to that... the food was tremendous!  I highly recommend the ""Man Vs. Food Favorite"" (the Sage Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict). I loved it (and almost finished all of it.. and I'm a big guy).  It's a bit of a noisy atmosphere, but the staff is totally accommodating and friendly!!  I highly recommend this place (as do most all Yelpers who visit) for breakfast and/or brunch!"
2499,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I absolutely love this little spot, and I have a feeling I'll be back someday. There's so many more dishes on the menu I would love to try!"
2500,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Excellent, Hhhuuuugggge portions, delish.   BLT Bloody Mary and salmon hash, kids bacon waffle."
2501,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Gigantic portions, great breakfast.  The hashes are served in an iron skillet, and it is more than enough food for 2 people.  I also had a kiwi-watermelon lemonade, which was served in a huge glass and was very pretty since they layered the different flavors on top of one another."
2502,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food was excellent â¼ the service was also great for somewhere so busy. The wait seems long initially but the lines moved really fast. The food was extremely fresh as well. You must check your luggage with the hotel, so handle this while you wait, if you have any."
2503,Hash House A Go Go,5,"the portions here are insane! you can go here and expect a HUGE amount of food so go here on an empty stomach or share with someone because its crazy.and everything is delicious! even something as simple as a grilled cheese becomes totally decadent and messy that can only be handled with a fork and knife lol.

 i had a unique experience there too when i also went there the day they were shooting an episode of that ABC show ''what would you do'' with  john quinones . it was an episode where there was a fake polygamist family eating breakfast lol. i noticed all of the hidden cameras lol"
2504,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Little piece of down home farm cooking! My Fiance and I hit this place up early on a Saturday morning. Wait was a bit long, looked like we should have called for reservations. Once we got in our experience was amazing. Our waitress Fonda was attentive and personable. When it came time to order my Fiance ordered 2 pancakes, she asked him if hed ever had them there before. We hadn't so she proceeded to explain the 12 in size. We decided 1 would do with a laugh. When out food came out she was not kidding the pancake was bigger then his head! My scramble was delish and fresh. Crispy potatoes were perfectly crispy and soft inside. I loved them so much. Price point was cheaper then the awful hotel buffets! Go go here!"
2505,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was good-long wait time and the dining area was cramped. Fair prices, lots of food and nice staff. It was a place we had to try because had seen the Man VS food episode where he recommended it. Glad we went."
2506,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First day in Vegas. And loved this place. The customer service was awesome. very nice man! We ate the chicken and waffles, and the Andy omelette thing. Can't wait to come back to this place."
2507,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was so happy to find a new, fun breakfast spot in Vegas. We were staying at Nobu, so we basically had to go outside and then right into the Quad to get to HH. I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of food we received, but everything was delicious. The atmosphere is quaint and diner-esque, and there were all kinds of people inside, which was really nice.

I had the avocado and bacon scramble with fried potatoes and fresh fruit, and my friend had the chorizo hash. Both dishes were huge, really pretty, and extremely tasty. I sampled some of the hot teas as well. The orange spice was my favorite! It was the perfect blend of sweet and spice. My friend had the house s'mores mocha, and the thing was massive. Massive!  I don't think I've ever seen a mug quite so large. It was fantastic as well, and had tons of ooey gooey marshmallows on top.

I would love to go back and try pancakes or something. I'm sure they are delicious as well. I am thinking this will be a new breakfast spot for us in future Vegas trips to come."
2508,Hash House A Go Go,5,The brunch is fabulous. I had the Tractor combo with griddle French toast and it was just the right amount of food!  Portions are huge so be prepared to take a box or share with a friend!
2509,Hash House A Go Go,4,We were here on a Saturday morning for breakfast. There were lots of people waiting to be seated. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait. We actually waited no more than 15 minutes which was a nice surprise. The menu has a great variety to choose from without being overwhelming. The food was delicious. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The price was very reasonable. I didn't give 5 full stars because my husbands plate of food came out a good 5 minutes before my plate. I would have preferred both plates be brought out at the same time. I definitely recommend this place as a great choice for breakfast.
2510,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My friend has the fried chicken sandwich and it was amazing. It looked like and whole chicken on Texas Toast.  I had the Crab cake and that was amazing as well. The crab cake came with scrambled eggs, hash browns, and a few slices of melon. I will recommend this place to anyone that goes to Las Vegas. The service was great and so was the food. I would recommend coming in with a huge appetite or sharing with someone. The portions are huge."
2511,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I agree with other yelpers that this place is overhyped. I liked the big portions because it allowed us to share, but the flavor was lacking and over powering at the same time. Our server was great, but our food was not. My brother and I split the roasted chicken hash and man, was the rosemary super strong! I like rosemary, but it tasted almost bitter. The potatoes were nice and crispy and the biscuit was tasty though. The famous chicken and waffles was disappointing. The presentation was awesome and looked promising, but the chicken was tasteless. The waffles were ok. All in all, it was just ok and we waited a long time."
2512,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Very busy so we had to wait, no problem. The problem was, they called us to our table and then refused to seat us because my two teenage boys had left to use the restroom!!! Can't be seated without everyone present! BTW only bathroom was DOWNSTAIRS! It's not like we were waiting for someone to show up, they just went to the restroom!! I'd give zero stars if I could!!!"
2513,Hash House A Go Go,4,"i will give 4 stars based on my favorite meal...the tractor driver breakfast with the banana brown sugar pancake.  i visited vegas for a week and came to hash house a go go three times for breakfast/brunch and one late night trip to split bread pudding and a watermelon lemonade (which was a little too sweet for my taste).  one visit we had a bad experience by waiting an hour for the food and an indifferent waitress.  i was immediately hooked on their fresh tangerine juice, but they only had it for my first visit.  the banana brown sugar pancake is so delicious.  the way the brown sugar sort of carmelizes to a yummy and sweet crunch...divine.  the griddled mashed potatoes were good.  WARNING:  their portions are SCARY HUGE.  i recommend sharing at this place regardless of what you order.  they send home leftover pancakes in a small pizza box to give you an idea.  all the items i saw or ordered came on platters or giant round plates that must have weighed five pounds alone.  a woman next to us the night we went in for dessert ordered a chicken pot pie which looked like a giant flying saucer of crust had crashed into it.  for my first trip, i got the fried chicken benedict which was good, but a little too much and too heavy for me.  my other trips were all about that banana brown sugar pancake.  trust me, if you like bananas, you can't go wrong."
2514,Hash House A Go Go,5,One of the most amazing places to go to in Vegas! It's a must for my boyfriend and I to come here every time we're in Vegas! Today we brought our friends and it was their first time. And they were amazed. We bragged about so much but they didn't actually expect what we said was true. Service is excellent. Never a rude employee. Always smiling and helpful. Hash house never disappoints. Recommend it to everyone.
2515,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy crap the portion sizes! Hahaha. If you're little, don't order your own plate. I had the #5 burger and while it was amazing, I could only eat 3 or 4 bites. Be prepared for a wait, but it is totally worth it. Very enjoyable and the staff are amazing, funny, and kind."
2516,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! If u are hungry, this is the place to be! All meals are well garnished and meals looks presentable. The ribs are awesome and the chicken pot pie is the BOMB!"
2517,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is a MUST-GO if you're in Vegas!!! The Corn Beef and Sage Chicken & Waffles were so flavorful!!!! And big portion sizes!!!! I already can't wait to go back!!!! YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!
2518,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The huge portions coupled with tasty food and reasonable pricing definitely sets this place apart. If you have an appetite, make sure to check out this place."
2519,Hash House A Go Go,5,FREAKING AMAZING. I was set to come here in July but the wait was two hours. This time though the wait was 30 minutes (we only waited about 5) and sat right down at a table. I would suggest looking at a menu prior and deciding because then they can get your order in quicker. They make everything from scratch and I can tell! Its so fresh and delicious. I wish we had one of these closer to my house! I will DEFINITELY be back and will be recommending it to friends!
2520,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband and I made the mistake of ordering separate meals and having a third dish to ""share."" No. That is not how this place works. The food portions are HUGE and absolutely delicious. We couldn't help but eat off all the plates but did not dare attempt to finish a single one in this sitting. The prices were more than reasonable, our check came out to be about the same as a night at Applebee's but for a lot more and a much higher quality meal. The environment for being a farm-style restaurant was a lot nicer than initially anticipated. The drinks were tasty. I would just recommend not bringing the kids. The food can take a while, and kids get impatient and loud. My husband and I weren't in any rush and weren't desperately hungry when we went so the wait wasn't terrible but it did make us question how long ago we had placed our order and ask the waiter on food times, but our meal came out almost immediately afterwards.
I've already recommended this place to all my family that lives here."
2521,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I absolutely love, love, love this place. They are open 24 hours, which is very convenient, especially in Sin City. Their portions are HUGE, and the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food and amazing quality. I suggest you go whenever they are not busy to avoid long waits. 

The LINQ Hotel provides Hash House for room service during certain hours.  Definitely a plus whenever I stay there! Some of my favorite dishes are the BBBLT, Stuffed Meatloaf, Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and the Quesadilla. Hash House is a MUST whenever I'm in Vegas!"
2522,Hash House A Go Go,5,"service is excellent, no wait, and very clean.

the food portions are humongous, flavorful, and delicious. 

i highly recommend their corned beef hash (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=bv0lllrJ6cJygQ3KfFOfzQ#bv0lllrJ6cJygQ3KfFOfzQ) and their chicken & waffles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=N8j9RNoVa0hwYSJqsHoGjw#N8j9RNoVa0hwYSJqsHoGjw)"
2523,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Quality great tasting food with a very attentive staff. It's was deep into the LINQ casino, impossible to find from the street. Look for the escalator it actually the entrance to the restaurant."
2524,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have waited 5 years to eat here and finally had my chance. Before this trip to Vegas they only had 2 locations that I am aware of, but now they have 4 or 5. If you are anywhere near Imperial Palace, head to the back of the casino and up the escalator to some of the best food you can find in Vegas. You will leave full and ready for a nap, almost no chance of finishing your meal as the portions are big enough for 2 or 3 people. Not bad Bud in a Bag for $5 to get your day started right. If you leave hungry , it's your own fault, this is good ol' comfort food done right. The wait staff is slow so don't be in a hurry.

Man v Food meal is very good and filling. Don't waste your time with the pot pie. It sounds good and looks amazing when you see it come out. Unfortunately the pot part is more like cardboard and not worth even a taste. Pancakes are massive, you only need one, wait make that half of one. Snickers pancakes, brilliant."
2525,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash house is a must when in Vegas (in the Linq Hotel) the servings are pretty big but the food is so delicious. Recently my boyfriend had the ""sopes"" and he loved them! I went basic as I eat like a bird and went for the classic waffle and it was very fluffy just like I like my waffles. 

My boyfriend and i are frequent Vegas visitors and our go to breakfast spot is Hash House! Be prepared to wait over an hour ( including the actual food serving time). 

You'll be amazed by the many many choices they have, it's hard to decide! Don't forget this place was aired on Man V Food! Enjoy"
2526,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Oh boy, painful, server took her time responding, waiting ten minutes just to alert her after waving 10 times, I get it, it is busy but man, awkward."
2527,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food was delicious we had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was crispy and infused with sage. The waffles had bacon inside and was just the right amount of sweetness. The coffee is strong and will get you going for the day. I can't wait to come back and try the turkey sausage.
2528,Hash House A Go Go,4,We've been to HHAGG before in Reno so we knew to share a meal & we were glad we did. Service was a bit slow but our server was great & the food did not disappoint. We will return for bfast again in the future.
2529,Hash House A Go Go,4,"NOT A PLACE TO GO FOR A QUICK BITE! However, Hash House A Go Go is well known for the huge portions and a filling, satisfying meal. 

So its 8:45 in the morning, the stomach a rumbling as a night of drinking let nothing but water and alcohol metabolize in me for the last 12 hours. Eggs and bacon needed FAST! So we went up the escalator and into the packed waiting room of this 24/7 diner. Nothing out of the ordinary in Vegas and with a 20 minute wait my friend and I learned how to kill some time.

Coming back however we ended up being 25 minutes where as we missed my name and waited no more than 2 minutes to be seated. The host at the time was very respectful of our wait and let us pass to get us to a booth. Sitting down, we were greeted by a more than happy waitress, taking our water orders and having us sit. 

DISCLAIMER: Don't break the rules here. My friend and I saw a few buddies and wandered off to their seats however were promptly warned that the plates were too larger to fit 6 in a table meant for 4 people. 

Being escorted back to our seats we ordered our food and drinks, myself sticking with the Huckleberry Sin and The Basic (three eggs any style, toast/biscuit, homemade jam, bacon and fruit). The meal itself was great, the portion being huge to where I could not finish it, but savoring every flavorful bite. The strawberry jam being the icing on the cake as it was fresh and complimented everything. The Sin was just as good, a mixture of berry with not too much natural sweet taste and something that will get you a good buzz for $9.99. 

Now we had about an hour wait for a food which knocks this place down a star to me, from start to finish being here for about an hour and a half, 60 minutes for food alone. I understand its a busy diner but more staff, better chefs preparing the food, or better time constraints can give them more customers. Otherwise than that the experience was great, the overly friendly waiter we got switched to keeping it legitimate with his drink choices and informing us not to get the $8 hourly shot with souvenir mug. Apparently not worth it. 

We left satisfied and ready to go. 10/10 for food, 5/10 for the wait, and 9/10 for the staff! Come to Hash House A Go Go and you won't be disappointed!"
2530,Hash House A Go Go,5,HUGE portions and good food! We got there at a good time with no wait but it was packed the entire time we ate with quite the line as we were leaving. I had a Greek Omelette with a watermelon mixed drink and Ryan had a pork tenderloin farm Benedict with a Bloody Mary. Both delicious! We were both sad we didn't find in until the last day because we would have gone there more!
2531,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had brunch here this afternoon.  I had the chorizo, jalapenos hash, my husband had the egg scramble and daughter had an apple cinnamon pancake.  Our food was delicious.  I totally recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The wait was about 30 min so not long at all.  Hotel also looks like a nice place.  Might stay here next visit to Vegas."
2532,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I decided to thumb through all of the reviews before posting my own because for one, I wanted to see what everyone else ordered that had this restaurant rated an average of four stars and two, it was imperative that I see how many Black faces were eating there because what ""I"" was served had absolutely NO seasoning. It was chicken. It's engrained in Black DNA not to do bland. How do you even think to cook chicken and not even put your finger on the damn seasoning cabinet? That in and of itself was disrespectful.

For clarification, I visited here because my ""friends"" on Facebook said that it was the place to go. I put friends in quotes because clearly I need to reexamine this list if they'd ever recommend a place that didn't even pinch the salt for their fried chicken. I had the sage chicken and waffles. I think they just called it sage-y because they wanted to be able to charge you for putting that lone a** piece of sage on your plate for decoration because you d*mn sure couldn't taste it. I guess you're supposed to bite the chicken and then eat one of the sage leaves...kind of a do your own blending thing? I dunno. They also said that the waffles were made with bacon in it. The waitress swore that this dry bread with bacon bits (no, for real....the joints you put on a salad) was ""amazingly good."" Lies. She. Told.

I will say that they DO give really large portions. Two people could easily split the chicken and waffles and leave the restaurant with a full belly without issue. But the food itself (and my waitress*) left a lot to be desired. 

Oh, the fries were good (I ended up eating this because of the disrespect to my person with the water flavored chicken). Speaking of water...the water was DISGUSTING. I'm not sure if it's the pipes in Vegas but it just ""tasted"" filmy. Also, don't order tea in Vegas and think it's gonna be sweet like we do in the south. I seriously wanted to flip all the tables over in that restaurant when I tasted that peach tea that was literally brown water with a half a squirt of unsweetened peach flavoring.

Waitress: oh it's not sweet to you?

Me: not at all.

Waitress: the peach is what adds the sweetness.

Me: y'all must've made it with some out of season peaches then.

Anyway, two thumbs down for me. My plate was gross, unseasoned, couldn't enjoy the water, and I'm mad that Vegas still hasn't taken a queue from the south when it comes to sweetening tea.

* = our waitress didn't come back to check on us, didn't offer to refill any drinks on the table, and we had to look for her when we were ready for our check. Again, I'm not sure what food or service everyone else received but my own definitely wasn't worth more than 2 stars (which I left only because the fries were really good. I love fries)."
2533,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The most delicious brunch on the strip! We waited 30 minutes and would have waited an hour, but we scoured 2 seats at the counter, which was a fun place to sit!
We had a server named Mary I think, so sassy and on point with her bodacious coffee creations and witty counter banter. We ordered and split the chicken and waffles huge dish...it was plenty for 2, with decadent coffee drinks to boot, No fresh OJ was the only critique, but I'll return many times for such delicious chicken and waffles!"
2534,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Fried Chicken and Waffles....can it get any better? So I've been to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in SoCal, which I would say is better, but I did like the sweet taste of their chicken. I think they cook it with some of the syrup from the waffles already poured on the chicken. I didn't like the soy sauce syrup, more of a traditional syrup guy myself, but this place sure did do the trick for the fried chicken craving."
2535,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So I've been meaning to get my Hash House fix for a while and was pleased to find that there was one located on the strip! No more venturing off to Henderson for the other location!

So I have tried a few things here before, but I'm writing this review for the brown sugar banana pancakes! They are simply delicious!! I wish I had ordered more (btw, I'm not a monster, I ordered the tractor combo and shared it). I haven't tried the other flavors of pancakes, and probably never will since the brown sugar banana pancakes are super satisfying! :)

Anyway, also had the kiwi watermelon lemonade again, which is always good! Oh and if you want to split a meal, which I highly recommend since the portions are huge, there is a fee of $2.50."
2536,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It is extremely over hyped. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but for the price it's not that great. The portions are huge. The food is okay not great. They put more effort into decorating the food then the flavor. It's honestly not worth the wait and price."
2537,Hash House A Go Go,4,"""Hey, My name is Christian, I'm your server, I make the best Bloody Mary in Las Vegas, and meat loaf here is the only meat loaf I eat outside of my Momma's. The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is what we are famous for because it was on TV. What can I start you with?!?""

Umm....Yes, Bloody Mary! 

Hash House A Go Go was delicious! Everything about my experience there was unique and worth every penny!!! My service was fantastic. The food was delicious (yet starchy - so paleo peeps beware!)!!

My server knew what he was talking about...he knew how to recommend it, and he didn't hesitate in answering my questions! I will definitely be back!"
2538,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came here because we have been to the San Diego one and loved it. Beware, they get very crowded at all times. But that is pretty much the same story for any good food place in Vegas. The menu is a little smaller than the normal Hash House but the food was delicious. I got the Farm Scramble with tomatoes, goat cheese and basil. I really really enjoyed that. The goat cheese was the perfect pairing for it. We also got their bloodies- the bacon one. I liked it but it was pretty spicy which I did not expect. It didn't say it was going to be spicy on the menu like some of the others did. It was harder to drink for me. Also, their bloody mary menu is very tiny compared to the normal Hash House which was a little disappointing. All in all, the food and service were really good just don't expect a great selection when it comes to bloodies (something they are known for)."
2539,Hash House A Go Go,5,Had the sage chicken and waffles! Delicious and huge portions! Come with an appetite. Also ordered the Snickers flapjack which tasted like you were eating a snickers bar. Yum
2540,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food here is reasonably priced with huge portions that only I seem to finish when I go with my friends. At the one in San Diego, I always got the cheeseburgers, but then I saw Man Vs Food and that ""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken"" thing is just too good to pass up every time I go now.

Be prepared to wait in line for a long time. Keep in mind there is a casino literally an escalator ride below you and you're in Las Vegas so if you can't keep yourself occupied for 45 minutes, you need more help than a good meal can provide."
2541,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash hash a go go is a great place to go if you are  very, very, very hungry. Why? Because the portion sizes are HUGE. Which makes it easy to split with someone else and save money, which is perfect. So far whatever I have ordered they gave me enought for 2-3 hungry people. The price is reasonable as well. As for the food? It's decent. It's not bad by any means but it is average-good. 

I also love the location at the LINQ as you can walk around before or after you eat. One downside is the wait is fairly long but like I said being in a casino you can walk around while you wait. 

My second complaint is if you have to use the bathroom you have to go all the way outside the restaurant and use the ones in the casino. But otherwise nothing else to complain of. A lot of famous people go there too and it's cool to look at the pictures on the wall of everyone. Give this place a shot for a nice brunch during the weekend."
2542,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love hash house! The portions here are huge. The first time I went I got the sage fried chicken benediction. I ate about a third of it before I was stuffed! I like that they have a unique take on benedicts - they use biscuits instead of egg mcmuffins, include a layer of mashed potatoes, and it's topped with scrambled eggs instead of poached, but you can request poached on the side if you want. They also come with their own unique sauce rather than hollandaise.

For my second time I shared with friends and had the blueberry pancake, quesadilla, and pork benediction. The pancake was good; very fluffy and came with a good amount of toppings. The quesadilla was delicious and like the benedictions, come with a layer of mashed potatoes! The pork benediction wasn't as good as the sage one I had my first time. I also wasn't expecting the pork to come fried. It had to much breading and the meat was a bit tough.

If this place served regular human portions, I would decrease my rating to a 3. But the portions are ginormous, food is decent, and the menu has a wide selection making it suitable for groups. There is always a line, but platinum members and higher are seated pretty much right away!"
2543,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Family brought me here for my first time claiming it to be SO Amazing... it was just ok. I had Norms last week that was better. The service was horrendous, I don't think our server wanted to be there. 

The food portions are big but they are just mediocre in flavor. 

I probably won't dine here again."
2544,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Words can't even describe how much I would recommend this place to readers. Their portions are enormous! To the point where I was challenged by the waitress to finish my plate and the meal would be on the house. I took the challenge but failed! I just couldn't do it! Everything is fresh and made to order. I expect the prices to be at least double what they really are, and I would still eat there! Our waitress Bri offered the best service I have experienced from any waitstaff."
2545,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go is my go to for a bomb af Chicken Pot Pie on the strip! I guess it can be considered a deconstructed chicken pot pie. I love how the ""crust"" of the pie is separate from the inner contents. Each bite was just so tasty. Serving sizes here are HUGE. There's enough food to go around for everyone to have a taste... or 5. The Chicken Pot Pie dish is big enough to share with another person and still have plenty to take back to your hotel for midnight munchies! A definite must try if you're in Vegas-- or anywhere else that has this restaurant. 

Ambiance is super nice and casual here. The workers are also super kind and accommodating."
2546,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They are known for their huge portions and the famous chicken n biscuits eggs benedict which Man vs. Food put on the map. Huge portions and flavors to compliment the ""hugeness"". Wait is a little long but the staff is cool prices are reasonable food is satisfying and you will not leave there hungry... good place"
2547,Hash House A Go Go,5,Me and my boyfriend shared the chicken and waffles and it was delicious!! WOW IT WAS SO DELICIOUS.  We usually can't share a meal because he eats a lot but we were able to share and still not finish the meal.  Soooo good.  We went back to eat again but the wait was too long
2548,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We have heard so much about Hash House so we wanted to give it a try on our last morning in Vegas. It's located at The Quad with free valet and he warned us there would be a wait. There was a wait of about 45 minutes, but luckily we were able to go downstairs and gamble while we waited. I got the famous sage fried chicken beni and my husband got the chicken scramble. Both were huge and great! We had so much food left over - enough for 3 more meals. I also got the smores mocha which was amazing!! So glad we cam here."
2549,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It took serveal trips to Vegas and suggestions from multiple people before I got around to trying Hash House. It definitely lives up to the hype. Trust and believe you'll get your money's worth. I had the Snickers pancake, you only need 1, and it barely fits on the plate. My bro had the wings and waffles, easily serves 2, or 3 meals for the average eater. Open 24 hours, and several locations, give the place a try."
2550,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I got to this place at 11 pm on a Sunday and was immediately seated.  However, after ten minutes of waiting and not even one server greeted my table nor took my order.  Service was bad enough to leave."
2551,Hash House A Go Go,3,"So I would give this place 3.5 starts. It is super busy so the wait was about an hour but it goes really fast. People ended up leaving and we actually got a table in about 30 minutes.

All of their portions are ginormous. Like 3 hungry people could share a meal. We opted for us all to get our own plates and barely made a dent. They are famous for their chicken and waffles and their Benedict. 

Even though the portions were huge the food was just okay. It was more of a novelty for you to experience. Not sure if I would go again."
2552,Hash House A Go Go,5,Our server Ken was great. He answered all our questions effectively regarding the variety of dishes on the menu. Of course I had to have their specialty chicken and waffles ($19.99) paired with the humongous s'mores mocha ($8.99). The gooey marshmallow topping is mind-boggling. Everything on the menu is HUGE- all good for 2 people to share. This location at the Linq hotel is open 24 hours and serves breakfast food all day and night. Good value for money in Vegas!
2553,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A Vegas tradition every time we come!
Couple things.. 

Firstly there's going to be a wait. Plan ahead. Seriously. Put your name in, walk the hotel, get coffee and come back. If you spend an hour and a half of your Vegas experience sitting in their waiting area.. You're doing it wrong.

Second thing.. Their portion sizes are huge.. Obviously. So if you were expecting to get your food 10 minutes after you sit down.. Maybe IHOP or Denny's is more your speed. 

I usually go with the Chicken and Waffles which is amazing, but I changed it up to the fried chicken Benedict, which was good- but the bulk of the meal comprised of their potatoes, which although tasty, become less tasty when there is legit 2lbs of them on your plate.

The girlfriend got the Bacon Waffle which was bomb, and much easier to eat (and better tasting in my opinion) than their heavy pancakes. 

All in all another successful Hash House trip!"
2554,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Not worth the hype. I ordered the meatloaf and my wife got the fried chicken benedict. The meetloaf was extremely dry and lacked flavor. The fried chicken didn't mesh with the rest of the dish and also lacked flavor. There was a 40 minute wait to be seated so we expected to be wowed.  If you are a foodie then this place is not for you.  If you just want something different to take a picture of and do not care about taste, give it a shot. 

Much much better options available in Vegas."
2555,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The tagline for the joint is ""twisted farm food,"" but it really should be ""good food writ large,"" with emphasis in the ""large."" Hash House can't do anything small. But that's OK. The quality does not suffer from the size of the potions. 

I have had the 1 lb. stuffed burger here multiple times. Note: Before attempting, skip breakfast & lunch. I get mine stuffed with cheddar & bacon (skipping the avocado), one of three varieties. It comes with a steak knife and a sprig of sage stuck on the top. Tip: Use the knife; you cannot eat this burger whole. The burger is good beef, cooked just right. The side of fries is huge and they are cooked just right. The drizzle of BBQ sauce and the sticks of something add a nice touch. All-in-all, a burger, fries, and a lemonade will run you just over $20 (with tip) and will leave you with a good taste on your tongue, a warm feeling on your belly, and no need to eat for the rest of the day. 

I had a breakfast here too, a chicken breast deep fried with a maple glaze, grilled mashed potatoes with bacon, and two eggs w/ fruit & a biscuit on the side. Once again, the dish was huge. The chicken breast was magnificent. The biscuit was flaky and huge. I could not finish. I passed on the overpriced OJ to keep the cost below $15, but once again, this is a meal that can last you the day. 

Hash House dies not try to be pretentious, like so many Strip establishments. It's hearty food, and while the prices seem Strip-like (that is, 50% higher just because it's in Vegas), the amount you get easily justifies the prices (at least for the food; they must make their nut on drinks, where even soda prices are stratospheric). This is a destination place to ear when you are in Vegas."
2556,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Tried their signature Chicken and Waffle dish. My hope for this place was very high based on their reviews - did not meet my expectations. However, food was good but not something I will miss. Definitely unique as they use waffle syrup for their chicken. Asked for a bbq sauce, ummmm pretty gross.. Not your reg. Bbq sauce. Stick with their syrup that comes with the food."
2557,Hash House A Go Go,5,We had food coma after eating here. The service was great and fast! But the food and portion was out of this world humongous and delicious! I had the Sage fried chicken benedict and it was good just needed a little more of the sauce as the biscuits were a bit on the dry side..Too bad there isn't one close to us back home in Cali..Will have to plan a drive to San Diego one day which is the closest location to us. We would definitely visit this location again and I highly recommend this place to anyone. Bring your appetite!!
2558,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hidden Jem & Open 24 hours!! Always in Vegas, but first time here!
Bring your appetite! My friends and I come to Vegas often, but I've been missing out all these years. Today was our first time coming here and it was so delicious! They are open 24 hrs which is perfect for those late nights.
All the servers are very nice. We had a really friendly server named Angel who made the experience a great one.
I would definitely recommend this to a friend and would come back again. 

Traveler Tip: the menu is large and so are their portions so a plate can easily be split and just add a side if looking to save money or not take food back to the hotel. Also there are plenty of TVs around the bar area if you'd like to catch a game. 

I am a fellow traveler who appreciates when others have provided me tips while I've traveled. If this review was helpful, please ""like"" so I know it made a difference. Even if it helps one traveler it's worth it to me. Cheers!"
2559,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you ever wanna break up with someone, come here!
Your future ex will be so over come by how good the food taste that they will happily just finish their food and go on about their life. No drama for you! The food tastes so good, it'll make you wanna slap yo mama!"
2560,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portion size is off the charts! 

This was our second time here and what are the chances of being sat in the same booth as the year before? 

Came here on a Monday after EDC so you know we were in need of a lot of food!  

Love that our waiter was straightforward and fast!  

Wait was a bit long 35min and once sat down a lot of empty tables were available which was a bit odd."
2561,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I have been to hash house a few times and I always get the same thing. The Andy's sage chicken Benedict. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and get over there right away and dig in, you won't be disappointed. 

This dish has a delicious chipotle cream sauce with scrambled eggs, fried chicken, tomatoes( I don't get them, hate tomatoes), cheese, and biscuits. This is a hearty meal and can serve 2-3 people, it's huge! 

The service has always been good, and never takes long to get our food. I'll be in vegas in 2 weeks and can't wait to get my fix!"
2562,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Finally made it to this place.  Wife has been wanting to try it for a while.  Had family and friends staying at the Linq so we went for breakfast.  
Got to the spot around 10am and there was a crazy amount of people waiting. With a group of 7 we ended up having to wait a bit. That was the worst part is the whole experience. 
Our waiter dude was very cool.  He was attentive enough and friendly. Since it was all our first time he mentioned that they served healthy sized portions. So my wife, bro, and I ended up splitting the chicken and waffles. The portions were so big that this worked out perfectly. There was plenty for three people and everything tasted excellent. 
Overall everyone loved the food and had a nice experience. We would definitely come again.  Just be ready for a wait."
2563,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food was fine, but the server forgot my order. Even though she repeated it out loud. The rest of my group was served and she was sure that I did not order. When I repeated my order it started to ring a bell in her mind and she quickly went to order the dish in the kitchen. Food was huge and tasty so yay for that."
2564,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It takes about 30mins minimum to get seated since it gets so full (if you're not one of the first to arrive I guess). The eggs, potatoes, and bacon that I got were very good but not quite great. The watermelon kiwi lemonade however, was very tasty :). Boyfriend got the waffle and fried chicken stack, and he enjoyed it."
2565,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always always always delicious!!! I refuse to come here during the morning/day hours but late at night is prime time. There are way too many people that eat here and the line is ridiculous but its all worth it. 

I will be back soon"
2566,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go is a gimmick restaurant and that gimmick is huge portions (pancakes the size of frisbees and gianormous plates of chicken and waffles) and ""twisted farm food."" I have to say within that gimmick Hash House A Go Go executes excellently.

I stopped by for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The wait was pretty long (45 minutes to get seated and another 45 to get our food) but we were given an accurate wait time and warned about the wait for breakfast when seated so I felt okay with the wait.

I ordered the Tractor Driver Combo with a Snickers flapjack. The Snickers flapjack is a frisbee sized buttermilk flapjack with pieces of Snickers thrown right into the pancake. As the food arrived I could see the little Snickers craters throughout the pancake. Again, this is a gimmick, a candy bar baked into a pancake, c'mon! But I'll have to say, I thought it was delicious. Enough to think I should keep a Snickers bar in my pantry for all my pancake adventures.

Is this the greatest restaurant of all time? Nope, but if you're in for the gimmick of big food that's over the top in its presentation, Hash House A Go Go will definitely deliver. I was also impressed by the Bloody Mary that my friend ordered that had a strip of bacon in it and was served with a side of toast. Truly a brunch appetizer as much as it was a drink."
2567,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We ate here for a late breakfast.  The BLT Bloody Mary was delicious.  The fried chicken Benedict was amazing, the chorizo hash was great.  All in all very impressed.  The serving sizes a ridiculously large and seemingly wasteful, but that seems the norm on the strip.  I would definitely eat here again, happily.

Lastly, there was a long wait when we got there, but they ran super efficiently and for the number of people ahead of us they moved through quickly.  Waitress was kind and quick."
2568,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Been to Hash House several times before at other locations and have thoroughly enjoyed it each time. Today, not so much. We went to the Hash House at the Linq. It felt like they were trying to accommodate too many customers with too little staff. After being seated it took 5 minutes to have our waitress acknowledge us. After finally coming over she was very friendly and nice but seemed to be stretched thin. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles, my favorite here. The waffles and chicken were cooked well but were not served with Hash House's amazing reduction. Instead it was just served with a bland syrup. The flavor was way off and didn't put that awesome finishing touch on the dish. Again, just seemed like they had too much going on to get the details right."
2569,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always on point. Regardless of the location Orlando, Las Vegas inside the Linq or at the Rio same curtesy service and great food. Long lines but good coordination time goes by quickly.  My favorite food item HH Flapjack blueberry."
2570,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The portions here are HUGE! I am from Texas so I know a big plate of food when I see one but WOW! This place is always packed, but the wait went pretty fast. I will say, it is in a casino and it smells like it too. Cigarette smoke permeates the air in here, which is fine if you don't mind it (but I kinda do). The food was ok, our server got like ten tables all at once and she forgot about us a few times but I understand it happens. I don't really have much to rave or rant about so I guess that's it- big portions, busy, kinda stinks like cigarette butts."
2571,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love this place! I have to go there every time I am in Vegas and get the chicken and waffles. I also order a Smore's cappuchino. The food is great. One thing to know...the amount of food thy give you is ridiculous. I always share my meal with someone and we rarely finish it. It's a fun place. Loud and extremely busy. The only reason I can not give it 5 stars is because they do not take reservations. I actually just left Vegas today and did not go to Hash House on this trip because I didn't want to spend 30-60 minutes waiting for a table. There is a Hash House located off the strip that I believe does take reservations, it's worth the drive there if you have a car to avoid wasting so much of your time waiting for a table."
2572,Hash House A Go Go,1,"So not worth the hype. Thanks, Adam Richman...you owe us brunch. 

The hubby and I came here at 11:30 am on a Thursday. It wasn't busy at all. There was a 10 minute wait for the table, compared to an hour plus wait during weekends, not bad at all. However, the coffee tasted like sewer water. The signature chicken and waffles were mediocre at best -- the chicken was crunchy alright, but it was extremely dry and lacked flavor. The gimmicky waffles with bacon inside were below average. 

Do yourself a favor--if you're craving supreme chicken and waffles, cough up an extra 15 bucks and head on over to Bouchon at the Venetian. You won't regret it. 

Furthermore, the service was appalling. Apparently, it only takes a half a brain cell to work there. We noticed that our jam container was empty, so we put it at the edge of the table. The server passed by it at least 6 times, and didn't bother picking it up for a refill. When we finally flagged down another server, our server came back and gave us a half-empty jar of peach jam, not the strawberry jam we wanted. We also asked our server for butter and extra maple syrup for the waffles. It took him 15 minutes to come back! Seriously, Hash House A Go Go, I don't understand why you guys are famous."
2573,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions.

Typical cost for a hash plate is around $15

You get enough to serve almost 3"
2574,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Where can I even begin on this one?  Overwhelming does not even describe the amount of food you are brought ... They have no small meals here.  if you are grossed out by insane amounts of food and over the top creations ... this place is not for you.  Lucky for me I am a Man v Food type of guy and LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  WOW ... just thinking back I can't wait until I got to Vegas again JUST FOR THIS PLACE!

I had the chorizo plate, but the pancakes were huge, biscuits were huge, eggs benedict were huge (man v food chicken one was crazy) ...

BEST SERVICE in all of Vegas ... we got taken care of ... my only recommendation is calling ahead and getting reservations ... there is a lot of people that want to try this place so be prepared.  

Can't wait to go back and try more - everyone with my group loved what they got and went back to hotel and passed out in a food coma!"
2575,Hash House A Go Go,4,Tons of menu items to choose from & enormous portions! Be prepared to wait a while for seating.
2576,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Inside the Imperial Palace. Not what everyone makes it out to be, seriously. 

Alright, where to begin. Essentially it can be summarized quite efficiently as this:
They bring you a lot of food, enough for a regular diner to be challenged to finish during lunch/dinner/whatever-you-are-there-for, but it is ALL mediocre and it has a garnish stabbed through it with a toothpick as if that makes it gourmet or remotely non-mediocre. 

I had the chicken and waffles. The waffles had the bacon bits embedded in them. Mediocre waffles, even more so mediocre chicken, mediocre/uninspired and really unimpressive unless you are easily impressed with large portions (maybe they are 'normal' portions for some of the people rating this eatery so highly) that are just barely decent. Cannot recall what the girlfriend had but she did not come close to finishing it all. I never wanted to see these miserable chicken or waffles again so I forced myself to eat all of it (minus the garnish). 

In conclusion, it sucked. Sucks. Go elsewhere for GOOD FOOD. Or maybe other Hash House A Go Gos are better; I never tried any others after this experience. Look for other reviews on the others because I will try them just because I am  masochistic."
2577,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Just stayed at The Linq and ate here twice. Once in the AM after not going to bed and we all ordered burgers and fries. They were great and we were all happy. Service was also very good. We got there right before the rush and huge line so everything was smooth. 5 stars! 

Went back late at night and it took 15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge we were sitting down. Server was rude but whatever. Ordered a couple of appetizers including chicken fingers. No taste whatsoever. Breaking falling off. 

For an entree I had he BBLT and it was good. My friends had the chicken and waffles which was ok - same story as chicken fingers with the chicken but the waffles were good. Presentation is great. Someone had another burger which was just as good as the first time and the other had something I can't remember. I would definitely go back and stick to burgers!"
2578,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food! Extremely flavorful, and portions large enough to feed you your guests, and an additional whole nation! You will not be disappointed!"
2579,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Service was quick and friendly, food was decent. Portions are huge! People are not kidding when they say that. Got a kids pancake and it was literally bigger than her face, she loved it! The chicken fried steak was very good"
2580,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Be prepared to wait if you come around 11am. We waited around 20-30mins to get seated and around 30mins to get our food. I really want to say to come here really hungry coz the serving is really huge but then with the wait time you'll probably pass out before you get your food! Lol I ordered the HH famous meatloaf and it was really good! My husband on the ordered the chicken with waffle on the menu and it was just ok for me, though he said it was great for him. I wish I had remembered reading the Yelp reviews first coz I forgot that we should've just split our order as we ended up with so much leftovers. The kiwi watermelon lemonade is really good too. This place is definitely worth a try and is affordable if you have a big group and sharing."
2581,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I stayed at Bally's 2 weeks ago. This place was in walking distance and from the reviews it seemed like a must go. I got there around 7:30 a.m. No wait. I don't like to wait...The items on the menu all sounded interesting but I ordered the Sage fried chicken benedict. It was waiter recommended and man vs. food approved. How could I go wrong. Right? The food came out pretty quick but the look on my face was one of confusion. Visually unpleasing. In essence a hot mess. I just hoped it tasted better...but it didn't. The food was warm, there a heap of mashed potatoes on top of already dense biscuits, it's called a benedict but there was no poached egg only 1 scrambled egg underneath this disaster and to add insult to injury they fried pieces of angel hair spaghetti and stuck it in the center. What the? The cost $18.99. In conclusion if I'm ever in Connecticut which is close to me I would retry this restaurant because I feel there's a reason why it's so loved."
2582,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So delicious.  Ate there twice on my last vegas trip.  First item up was the duck (don't remember exact dish name) but it was so good and there was so much duck.  Usually duck dishes are on the smaller size but this was pretty big.

The chicken and waffles are delicious.  The chicken was a tiny bit dry or I'd say it was just perfect, but overall really really good.  Should of ate there every meal in vegas."
2583,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This has to be my FAVORITE breakfast place on the strip. I work for Caesars and anytime anybody asks me for recommendations I ALWAYS mention this place. The positions are redonkulous and the quality of the food is beyond reproach. I have been there multiple times and have just forgotten to give it a review since, I am usually in a food comma after lol.. You should definitely try the Sage Chicken and Waffles !! They are an experience hahaha! Will come back again soon!"
2584,Hash House A Go Go,2,"A few years ago we vacationed in San Diego and had amazing chicken and waffles from Hash House A Go Go.  On our trip to Vegas, we kept with tradition and decided to go there for breakfast.  We went the same weekend of a college basketball tournament, so the place was packed.  The turnover seemed pretty fast, and we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  Their breakfast menu is intimidating, they have so many tempting options.  One tip, i remember from the past is that their portions are large.  We had been eating out all week, and i just wanted a simple meal.  I ordered the two egg breakfast with potatoes, bacon, and a biscuit.  The whole meal was bad, the only thing that was edible were the eggs.  The 2 measly strips of bacon had every drop of fat rendered out, it was way too crisp.  The potatoes, i did like the addition of the red onions, but they were bland, they needed seasoning. How do you name your self Hash House, and not serve amazing potatoes?   They have a biscuit or toast option, and i was never asked so i assumed they they would bring me toast, instead a very dense biscuit arrived.  My sister ordered the steel cut oatmeal with fruit, and as beautiful as it looked, it was poorly executed.  The banana was simply halved, and still had the peel on.  The melon was peeled but it was segmented into enormous pieces.  I don't think that when you eat out that you yourself should have to prepare you own meal.  Also, i don't know if this is standard or if someone in the kitchen was attempting art, but they smeared blackberries around the rim of the plate, it was very off putting.

Overall, i was very disappointed at the lack of consistency within the restaurant chain.  I really hope that it was just an off day, because i  like what they stand for for and the dishes they are able to put out."
2585,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Insane meal. The portions make Claim Jumpers portions look like a little mid-morning snack. 

We made our way to the Imperial Palace (hopefully the last time I ever say those words) on Friday night at about 10pm. We were expecting a huge wait and no one was there. We were seated in the empty dining room. 

We ordered our drinks and the Cornmeal Shrimp starter and Sage Chicken and Waffles to share. The shrimp was okay, four shrimp but the cornmeal crust fell off with the first bite. The chicken and waffles were amazing. Fried leeks, bacon cooked into the waffles, super good fried chicken ... we loved it. 

I think we tried everything we wanted to on the menu, so we probably won't go back, but we loved it for a one-time visit."
2586,Hash House A Go Go,5,My husband new about this place and heard it was great and he was right.  We split and a breakfast hash and chorizo plate and a waffle and we both full.
2587,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was so delicious. We went to have brunch and my sister and I shared a plate of chicken and waffles which was so huge and so yummy !! I would definitely go back next time we're in Vegas. I recommend everyone who is hungry to go and try this place, you won't be disappointed.

Great place to go for breakfast or brunch !!"
2588,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Whenever I go to Vegas, there are ultimately three places I end up eating at: the Bacchanal buffet, a ramen place, and Hash House A Go Go. This restaurant is open 24 hours a day and serves absolutely gigantic servings of American classics, whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They are known for their tag line of twisted farm food, and twisted is a great way of putting it. Some examples include their sage fried chicken and waffles which comes as a tower of food, and I really mean a tower of food, and their hand hammered pork tenderloin, which comes on a platter as big as a pizza pan. Most of the dinner dishes are amazingly huge, and the last two times I visited, our group of 4 could barely finish 2 dishes. The most recent time I visited, I sampled their corned beef hash, which was made in house and was served on a cast iron skillet.Their also have a bar which serves gigantic drink (it's Vegas, they have to have a bar) and the prices are super cheap compared to most other places. The food here would be amazing after a long night out or maybe after a long day exploring the strip. If you're searching for a breakfast place that doesn't break the bank and serves quality food and enormous portions, hash house a go Go is a phenomenal choice. I will continue to visit here every time I go to Vegas without question."
2589,Hash House A Go Go,3,This place was inside the hotel where we were staying. It was recommended to eat here. It was nice and quiet during the time that we ate here. Our server was a bit busy so we waited for quite a bit to be served and to even get our drinks. He was polite but not very good at service in general. The food was good and very big portions. I would come back here sometime despite the service.
2590,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing food. Huge portions. You can easily share an  entree (but why would you). Everything taste great
2591,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best breakfast I've ever had.  Sage fried chicken was amazing! No wait to get in.  If in Vegas, you have to try this place."
2592,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Too drunk or hungover to know any better? That's my conclusion to this place and those who leave a positive review. Like someone wrote previously, ""Rejected dive hotel buffet scraps recycled at a Hash House A GO GO."" 

When your polite and friendly to the food servers, they screw up the order without any apology then blame you (classic denial), then when you ask to have the food in a ""doggy bag"" they instead throw the food away, once again blame you?? Come on folks. Have you been that lucky to give this place a good review or have we and many others been that unlucky with this overpriced meh food at best?

Seriously, Undercover Boss and Restaurant Stake Out MUST come here to show you people what really goes on in this dump."
2593,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge line. Make a reservation before. HUGE servings, must split meals, no way anyone can finish the amount they serve per person, this meal will keep you full all day!"
2594,Hash House A Go Go,1,Really wanted to try this place since I haven't been and I live near one in SD. UNFORTUNATELY I ordered the sage chicken fried Benedict and I'm about 90% sure they served me a mistake cooked sitting and waiting in the back. My BF showed up five minutes later ordered the same thing and his took thirty minutes to get there but was fresh while mine showed up in about five
2595,Hash House A Go Go,5,Steak and eggs special is great... it comes with of course steak and eggs... some mashed potato concoction that is out of this world... loved it...I'm not one for mashed potatoes but this was really really good and a huge biscuit which they offer with butter and strawberry jam... I actually ate the biscuit for the strawberry jam... And a little side of fruit... All this for 14.99!!! I'm definitely coming back... oh and it's open 24/7!!!
2596,Hash House A Go Go,5,"the food was enormous, and excellent.  my husband and i waited for about 30 mins and it was on a sunday, the wait was ok.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, and they were by far so delicious, that I could barely finish it.  my husband ordered the chicken with the eggs benedict, and he said it was delicious as well."
2597,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is always a must while visiting Las Vegas. It's a hardy meal for an affordable price. The wait staff are always nice and funny! Food is amazing and huge! You definitely won't leave hungry. We always come late night, so we never have to wait for a table. Fav place to eat on the strip."
2598,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Don't go there!!
Me and my friend had the burger #5 
and have foodpoisoning ever since...like really bad.
Wouldn't wonder me if it was salmonella poisoning...

Something's definitely wrong with the kitchen and the hygiene in this place"
2599,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food with large portions, what more could you ask for? I chose the chicken and waffles during my visit. The chicken and waffles come with 2 chicken breasts plus more meat and I got around 4 waffles with mine. The waffles were filled with bacon and you could taste a great amount of nutmeg in the batter which excellent, yet not over done.

The bloody Mary there was very interesting for me as I'm not a fan of certain tomato sauce or juice. This was by far one the best I have personally had and can highly recommend it. The drink has a huge strip of bacon in it as well and its a bit more on the spicier side than others.

Finishing this up the restaurant had a loud upflow atmosphere and service was on point here, servers are very attentitive during peak hours and was very satisfied."
2600,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Where to start?  If you are hungry and you want to leave full while feeling like you received full value for your purchase price, go here.  This place is in the Linq and is a little tucked away but that doesn't stop swarms of people from coming here.  We went on a Monday morning so there was only a 15 minute wait, from which I have been told is about as short as it gets.  The hostess was friendly but not talkative, but they got my party of 8 down in a timely manner.  Our server was very good.  He was positive, timely and attentive.  The restaurant is clean and there are tons of pics of celebrities who have dined at Hash House (Channing Tatum was my fiancÃ©e's favorite but whatever).

The food, well the portions are massive!  I got the Andy (a man v food fave) and my fiancÃ© got biscuits and gravy.  On portion size this place should receive 6 or 7 stars.  If you want people you don't know at other tables to stare at you with ""are you really gonna eat all that"" face as your food is delivered, then eat here.  The quality?  Well, it starts off strong as a 5 star experience but since the portions are so huge as you progress, your toppings and sauce get less and less, meaning your last bite is two stars while the first one is five.

Of course I will go back whenever I am in Vegas.  Yes, I ate the whole thing."
2601,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had the maple bacon flapjack, it was as big as a steering wheel on a Cadillac! It was perfectly cooked, with sweet crispy edges of brown sugar! Delish! I love that the send scraps to a local pig farm!"
2602,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for breakfast with my husband and overall really loved the idea of everything made custom and from scratch. We both got hashes -- he got the corned beef and I got the chicken. The corned beef hash was by far, hands down, the best we've ever had. A friend of ours got the chicken and waffles, said that was great as well. The BLT bloody mary was a cool concept, but overrated and wasn't all that great. Like I said, if you're ever in Vegas looking for a breakfast spot, I'd definitely recommend coming here for the corned beef hash."
2603,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Regretted this breakfast choice. They are making a name for themselves on the HUGE portions alone. Or at least from the choices we made. My husband had the biscuits and gravy and I chose the Adams sage chicken Benedict. Both were obscene, which don't get me wrong, we were expecting, however, they were missing flavor. They served both dishes on top of dry mashed potatoes (about 4 to 5 large potatoes worth of mashed potatoes). The biscuits for both dishes were also very dry. The chicken was good and I enjoyed the hollandaise sauces (but there definitely wasn't enough sauce to moisten the family size portion of mashed potatoes on my plate). My husband didn't enjoy his gravy at all and actually was sick afterwards.  The wait was long for a table and the food was slow to come to the table. Overall, I really expected a better meal after an hour. Next time we'll go back to Guy's for his HUGE but also flavorful breakfast."
2604,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It started with seeing Hash House A Go Go on a Vegas website. Then found out it was a Man VS Food stop, which if you know me, know that I had to go once I heard that. We stopped in for breakfast and we got there just in time. When we walked up there were only 2 people in the restaurant. When we left there were about 20 people waiting to get in. we were greeted by an excellent server, who definitely knew his shit. He was on it with recommendations, suggestions, asking what stuff we liked. He was awesome.  We ordered some drinks that came with boba straws in them, which in my opinion gets you drunk faster.  More liquid quicker. We ended up splitting a dish and I am glad we did because they give you a mountain of food. We got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. First of all, the chicken breast was bigger than my hand. Second it is the best fried chicken I have ever had... Sorry KFC.  The seasonings in the batter was perfect and the maple made the chicken breast so tender. The chicken was sitting on top of 4 bacon strips that topped a mountain of thick mashed potatoes. Added to the plate were 2 eggs, and fruit all over the dish, a biscuit that honestly didn't need any butter or jam. It was moist and very flavorful on its own. I added a couple of pork sausage links because I didn't really that they made plates to feed mountain men. But those were really good also. I really don't think I could complain anything at all for this place. Perfect service, mouth watering food and cute atmosphere. I think I am going to make it a point to go back every trip to Vegas and try something different."
2605,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome chicken n waffles, also got the stacked friend green tomatoes.  Super good must try but crazy wait.  Go early sometimes two hour wait."
2606,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Maybe it's because I'm from Indiana, but this place was offensive.  They claim this is Indiana food and for the most part they have a ton of Indiana favorites.  Keep in mind, the food is very tasty and that is why I'm still giving it an A-OK rating but the portion sizes are seriously offensive.  Each order can feed 3 people.  I'm not even kidding.  This is an obscene waste of food as no one at my table even made dents by the time we were finished.  Multiply that times their 10? locations and the fact they are on an hour wait pretty much constantly and open 24 hours and I shudder to think of the food wastage. 

I'm guessing the large portions is part of the appeal here, but the flavor was REALLY good...I honestly think if portions were cut in half, and kept at the same high quality standard, this place would do exceptionally well still and hell..probably make a lot more money not spending so much on food.

I'm glad I got a chance to cross this off my Vegas list, but I would not plan on returning.

Also, our service was sub-par here which I assume is due to the freakishly busy nature of this place.  Still worth mentioning."
2607,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Giving 3 stars for this reason...just waiting for an hour for dine in. Changed our mind to order to go and it'll take 45mins. So we're changing our mind and dining in. What's the point of waiting for 15mins more? Smh...

I'm sure foods really good and I'm sure it's worth the wait. But this is silly to have customers wait at their mercy. Something..."
2608,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My family loves going to all the different hash house a go gos in the city.  There's one inside The Plaza on freemont too.   We love the food presentations, the large amount given to us!!!   services are over all excellent.   Great place for family."
2609,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I have been coming here ever since it was located in the Imperial Palace. Take the escalator upstairs. Serving sizes and taste have not changed. You get enough food for 3 meals and it is very tasty. Due to its popularity it gets very crowded very quickly so arrive early (before 7:00am). It is open 24 hours so you can opt for a very late dinner to avoid the crowds.
Call ahead and make reservations weekdays, no reservations on weekends.
While you wait check out their wall of stars. Pretty impressive the list of stars that have eaten here.
They have several TVs if you want to keep up with sports. 
Multiple seating choices: bar, table, booth. All 3 have views of the multiple TVs
I'll be back!!!"
2610,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It can be difficult to find somewhat cheap foods on the Strip but it's possible. Hash House A Go Go offers extremely large brunch/lunch foods for about $15 per person. It's located upstairs at the Linq casino.

The food here is very standard brunch/lunch foods like waffles, pancakes, sandwiches (BLT, etc), salads, and so on. The food overall was pretty good, I thought. I ordered a combo plate and got a ridiculously large waffle, a lot of eggs, and large strips of bacon. I was quite pleased with the food and finished most of it. The plate was about $15 but I thought it was a lot of food!

The waffle was bigger than my face and was easily cut into four sections. I thought 1-2 of the sections was ample enough! But it was really thick and went well with the syrup."
2611,Hash House A Go Go,5,OMG!!  I left stuffed and I didn't even order anything!!  Just had portions from wife & daughters plates.  Huge servings and great quality.
2612,Hash House A Go Go,1,Ehh. The quad used to be the imperial palace if that's any indication of where this place is. Taste of the food was overrated to the max. Chicken and waffles was bland. More touristy than anything else definitely not the eclectic dining experience its hyped up to be. Expect a 40-60 min wait for Denny's quality food.
2613,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The reviews for this place make it sound like a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately the experience didn't live up to the hype.

Upon arrival we gave our names for a table of 5, and only had to wait 5 minutes or so to be seated. The waiter took awhile to check in with us, and our drinks took at least 10 minutes. After ordering, we waited over 30 minutes for our food, and were getting really quite fed up by then. The waiter was nowhere to be found when we wanted more drinks, and didn't stop by to assure us about the wait until he knew our food was about to come out.

My advice for people eating here is to order something novel, not something simple, as the classics are the things they do least well. I'm an eggs benedict kinda girl but none of them caught my fancy (and most don't fit the description of eggs benedict, but regardless...). Two of us decided to split a buttermilk pancake, which was about the size of a pizza, and was fine. 

I went for the simple two-egg breakfast with soft poached eggs, ham, and potatoes. I asked for extra fruit instead of toast and was assured I'd get the fruit as listed, which turned out to be a slice of melon and a couple of sad pieces of fruit. I didn't even eat it. My plate was pretty empty-looking. The potatoes weren't fresh and the ham wasn't that hot. It was all just very dry and unappetizing. I tried to mix everything together into kind of a hash but ended up having to douse the whole thing in salt and hot sauce to get any flavor out of it.

Though I'd heard great things about this place, there's not much to love unless you're dazzled by big portions or crazy combinations with tons of ingredients. I tried the chicken and waffles, which was good but built in a big pile that had to be deconstructed just to eat it, which seemed like a lot of effort after a long wait. The service was slow and the food was subpar. Not impressed."
2614,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Meh. This place was just okay. The portions are very large. I had the corned beef hash and it was as-expected. The potatoes were crispy, the eggs were done as-ordered. I thought the coffee was bad and not hot enough compared to a normal diner. I wouldn't come back here."
2615,Hash House A Go Go,1,Awful food. Coffee not hot. Potatoes over cooked. Omelet was mush: I have no idea how they did that. Cost: $21. Waitress was great.
2616,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Awesome, awesome food. And very creative. You can tell it's all house-made. Pretty fairly priced for the portions you receive. I had the fried chicken benedict which was delicious. Unfortunately, we received so-so service and a couple of our orders were made incorrectly due to the server's error. Had the service been better it would've been 5 stars. Maybe next time."
2617,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So amazing that I visited twice in during the same trip.

Both times the wait was super long, so we scoped the bar area and waited for seats there. There was a line for bar seats but it wasn't terrible. The only annoying thing was that people would try to go to the other side and bypass the line. Luckily our bartender was super sweet and kept the line orderly! 

Now onto the food:

One of the best bloody Mary's I've ever had :)
Crab egg Benedict. OMG yes. A must order!
Fresh tangerine juice...soooo good.

The portions are HUGE; I highly recommend sharing or you'll have too much food. 

The next day I went back and ordered the salmon scramble. It was disappointing and watery? , but retrospectively, I should have probably ordered something else. The first food experience was just so amazing and I had excellent service both times that I didn't dock any stars. I would definitely go back next time!!!"
2618,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best place to have your heart attack served on a plate. Plan to share, the portions are HUGE. So indulgent but so good. Chicken fried Benedict is absolutely incredible."
2619,Hash House A Go Go,5,From the door to the floor everything was unique entertaining or delicious. I had the biscuit number that was shown on man vs food. It was wonderful and the appetizers were visually appealing and had a great taste.
2620,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Overrated. Ein Wort beschreibt das Lokal fÃ¼r mich sehr gut, aber ich fÃ¼hre das gerne noch weiter aus: das Hash Hash verspricht Farm Food with a twist, das bedeutet, man mixt traditionelle amerikanische Hausmannskost durcheinander und verkauft das als innovativ. Das Signature Dish ist die Chicken Waffel, das ist fritiertes Huhn auf drei Waffeln, die mit Speck gefÃ¼llt sind. Ganz ehrlich, das passt einfach nicht zusammen fÃ¼r mich. Ich habe mich deshalb auch fÃ¼r ein anderes Gericht, einen Hash mit HÃ¼hnerfleisch, Spargel und GemÃ¼se entschieden, das war dann aber auch bestenfalls Durchschnitt. 

Positiv anzumerken ist das kostenlose Wifi und der bemÃ¼hte Service."
2621,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This was a straight gut bomb! Too #fat too be #happy 
Sometimes less is more. #Glutton life, aka pop a button life. More veggies please."
2622,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great service, delicious food and huge portions. I ordered the chicken benny - their unusual twist on eggs benedict. More mashed potatoes than anything else which I didnt care for but that's just my preference. Wish I had more chicken or egg and cheese in comparison to the potatoes. The strawberry lemonade was delicious. Definitely had to bring home a doggie bag.  The price isnt too expensive but it isnt cheap either. Id definitely come back to check out other menu items they have."
2623,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for breakfast, and it was awesome! We are big eaters too and never leave with leftovers, but this place beat us! I got the chicken and waffles, and the boyfriend got a brown sugar banana pancake. The chicken and waffles comes with 2 hefty pieces of tender fried chicken and 4 hearty waffles. Really tasty! And the crispy leeks that come on top are a nice touch. I got through one of the pieces of chicken and 2 waffles before I had to give up. The waffles are also tasty standard waffles- not too crisp but a sturdy enough vehicle for chicken and syrup. My meal was good, but I was blown away by that brown sugar banana pancake!! Fluffy, HUGE, large pieces of banana, and with delicious crispy caramelization on the outside! I probably could've forced myself to eat that whole thing. Overall, I'll definitely be back, and I'll be dreaming of that pancake until then!"
2624,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food. Proportions too big   Must share. Good bloody Mary's and coffee waffle and chicken can feed 3 hungry people.
2625,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Man, this place has some serious wear and tear since I had been here a few years ago. 

3 stars for cleanliness and the lighting was dark and drabby where we sat. The smell of smoke was surprisingly strong and when we walked up to the front the ladies were blatantly shit talking and then a min later they kindly greeted us lol 

5 stars for the food. Had a bloody marry, the chicken and waffles and orange juice. Everything was YUM!"
2626,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I don't know what all the rage is about.  yeah, the food was HUGE.  The chicken was done with ginger, something i've had at post and beam in LA.  I got a breakfast plate (waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage).  Honestly, it was as average as a hole-in-a-wall.  Sure, maybe if I got that Man v. Food plate, they may have gotten one more star out of me, but the service would have knocked it back down to 3.

This was a 11pm food run with maybe a restaurant that was 45% full.  I shouldn't be applying this to all the servers since I did see several waiters wizzing by me numerous times; however, i just didn't see mine.  Never refilled my water, kept the table waiting for a box, then the check, the the receipt.  Literally, 22 mins between when I was finished and when I was able to sign the check and leave.  Don't get me wrong, the dude was nice.  Very courteous and opened his greeting like a pro.  When its closing to midnight, I just need basic service and I didn't get it - Sit, order, a refill, and check.  

Good:  Food
Bad:  Service"
2627,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Absolute winner. Long wait for breakfast on a Saturday- not to worry, there's a bloody mary stand in the waiting area. One of the best bloody marys I've had in a while.

Tasty comfort food. Watch out for the portion sizes (3 people could happily share the chicken and waffles). 

Worth a visit while in Vegas"
2628,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great portions (make sure you bring an appetite) and prices are moderate.The food never fails. Simple, good place."
2629,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was tasty, huge portions.  It was very crowded, when we got there mid morning it was a 44 minute wait. Also noisy.  We found seats at the bar, so we didn't wait 45minutes. I had the BLT Bloody Mary. The house Bloody Mary was just as good without the bacon. Our favorite was in the Cold Brew Coffee on tap. The cost was high, but pretty much what you would pay for a restaurant in a Casino."
2630,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must stop when in Vegas!  The food is always fresh, filling and the service is excellent.  My Crispy Salmon was cooked perfect and was delicious.  I'll be back on my next trip to Vegas."
2631,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was here a couple of days ago with friends. We had a party of 7 and there was no issue seating us. As a brunch lover I was totally satisfied with this meal. 
As we walked in I looked at other peoples plates and they seemed like very large servings. I suggested splitting something with someone but we all wanted to try different things so that didn't happen. The food was awesome! The servings were HUGE. If I hadn't been in such a large group with plans after brunch I would have taken the leftovers for at least another full meal. It was entertaining to see the plating as everyone's food came out. 
The coffee was really good and the prices did not reflect the large portions.
I will absolutely be back the next time we are in Vegas."
2632,Hash House A Go Go,4,Fun place. Large portions and good service. We split the chicken and waffles based on our waitresses recommendation. Great call. It was delicious and filling. Go early though. Line grows quickly on the weekend.
2633,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for breakfast, wait time was 20 minutes. My husband and I split an entree thanks to the waiters suggestion. I'm sure glad we took his advice because we both left full. We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. It was beautifully presented, the chicken was delicious, the biscuit was large and soft, the sauce that tied the whole dish together was amazing. Service was kind of slow but they were packed at 11:00am."
2634,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Come early because there's an extreme wait. Portions are HUGE, so you should definitely split your meal with one other person. 

I got the Chicken & Waffles and a side of potatoes. It was amazinggggg, but no way I would've eaten that by myself. 

During our wait, we made it a boozy brunch and went over to Harrahs to Numb for drinks."
2635,Hash House A Go Go,3,It was a nice atmosphere and great service. Had the sage chicken and waffles. The waffles were excellent but the chicken was a little bland with little flavor. Not bad for lunch and it was very filling.
2636,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh man, this is one of my favorite places for breakfast. It's totally worth the one to get there for as big as your head plates and so much food your waistband expands just looking at it!

The banana pancakes to die for! The potatoes nom nom nom, perfect in ever single way, crispy, flavorful, soft, makes my mouth just drool.

If you've never been here your missing out it has a nice variety of food no matter what you want and when you want it. 

Just be prepared to be rolled out of the restaurant and still feel like your wallet has money in it!"
2637,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My boyfriend and I were hungover and stumbling around Las Vegas Blvd looking for some breakfast.  We stopped in the Imperial Palace as it was right next to our hotel aka the closest place we could get to.  We saw the sign for the Hash House and figured it was some divey diner but just what we needed.  To our surprise the line of people waiting to get seated was huge.  We were shocked and instantly realized that his place was a must while we were in Vegas.  Unfortunately, we couldn't wait in time, our bellies were screaming for grease.  We ate somewhere else that day but on our last day in Vegas we came back to wait the line and get our grub on.  The line was about 25 minutes which wasn't too bad.  

Boy is this place worth the wait... as soon as we walked in we were having food envy of everyone's plates.  The portions here are huge.  The prices aren't that bad either, typical for Las Vegas.  I ordered the corned beef skillet which came with potatoes, fruit, biscuit, corned beef and 2 fried eggs.  The biscuit with the home made strawberry jam was amazing.  I wish my eggs were more runny because the potatoes were dry but owell, I loved it.  My boyfriend had the meatloaf skillet and equally was as pleased with his meal.  We tried to get the restaurant.com off our phone but couldn't get the application up - another thing we realized while in Vegas... realllly bad cell phone reception.  I love this place and will definitely be back!"
2638,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of the best breakfast's we have ever had. We had the Chicken & Waffles and Andy Sages Fried Chicken (Man vs. Food). Even though there were only 2 of us we could of fed four of us with the large portions served. There will be a wait to get in but it is worth it for sure. We were not going to take our left overs that we did not touch since we were on vacation and we're going to walk the Vegas Strip, but decided to take them anyway because you will see a few people on the streets of Vegas in need of food and did not want that much food to go to waste and gave it to a couple guys down the way who needed it."
2639,Hash House A Go Go,5,Had the sage fried chicken Benedict! Will change your life! Absolutely fantastic!! All of their meals looks amazing!
2640,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've visited this location probably 6+ times now for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have never been less than totally satisfied. Most recently I was lucky enough to have my dinner served by Crystal - she was a blast and a great help when I was having trouble deciding between two plates - I ended up going with the Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower, which I couldn't finish but boy did I have fun trying. You can get mediocre-at-best fast food nearby in the center strip for within a buck of two of what you'll spend at Hash House and I guarantee you will have a better time and a better meal dining at Hash House with Crystal."
2641,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions, great food & its 24 hours!!! I wish there was one these in Los Angeles. Only downside is that its always busy here. Waiting list is long. So make sure you have patience. It will pay off once you have your food. Best believe that."
2642,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very large portions, VERY LARGE! Service was a bit slow, but the place was packed for a Thursday morning. Potatoes were a little cold, that was the only concern. Otherwise it was yummy!"
2643,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh my Lord. The mashed potato burger... the kiwi water melon lemonade....where do I begin?!

Cool vibes, cosmically good food and drinks.... ask for a shot of vodka poured into your lemonade or do it yourself and you have the best damn drink of your life.

You can't go wrong here, not to mention bring your friends and you'll have cool points for the rest of your life. Even if you're just driving through Vegas make sure you stop here and enjoy life cause it don't get better than this! :-)"
2644,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I always love coming here when I visit vegas. The portions are huge so be prepared to eat to your heart's content and still have plenty of leftovers. I ordered the quesadilla for breakfast which was delicious, but couldn't eat more than a quarter of it. The service is always great/friendly. Try to avoid the Sunday brunch hour because it can get extremely crowded."
2645,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great brunch spot if you're in Vegas near the Lynq Hotel (across the street from Caesars Palace). The wait was a bit long but they do serve you bloody mary's while you wait and I found that the staff processed people as quickly as they could. We waited about 45 minutes for Friday brunch at around 11am. 

The food is casual and their thing is taking a twisted spin on standard comfort food items. We ordered the chicken benedict which is some fried chicken breasts ontop of scrambled eggs, some salad, bacon, and some biscuits. All of that is drenched in a sauce that I'm sure isn't great for your waist line but delicious. We also had their smore latte and the caramel latte. Both were insanely sweet but they're tasty and are worth sharing. 

The service was good. No complaints here. Our server was polite, funny, and pretty attentive. The environment is casual and the good part is you didn't get a whole lot of the hangover crowd. I saw a lot of couples, and a family or two.

Overall, I liked it here and I'd come again. I think the food is good, service is good, price is extremely reasonable given their portions and as long as you can wait a little bit to get seated then this is a must visit. Enjoy!"
2646,Hash House A Go Go,4,Too much food. Very good. Even talked to other couples and they agreed. Great place with great food.
2647,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a MUST for the All-American breakfast experience while in Vegas. Located in The Linq, you take the escalators up to this large, privately-owned restaurant (which our waiter explained is the reason why they don't have bathrooms in the restaurant, so keep this in mind). 

I would describe the food as ""elegant diner"" as the signature items have a cool twist but come in diner-sized (aka gargantuan) portions. This place is popular, so expect a wait of some sort but expect the line to move quickly as this spot is able to accomadate a large amount of people. Our table ordered The Big O Sage Fried Chicken and Waffle Tower (bacon slices are in the waffle), Tractor Driver Combo (blueberry flapjack, scrambled eggs, breakfast potato) and Andys Famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Everything was delicious and well-done. The fried-chicken has a rosemary seasoning that is very tasty and unique. Each of these dishes could easily be split between two people. 

Last but not least, a huge shout-out to our waiter, Michael, who shared his love for the food with all sorts of recommendations. Thank you Michael for taking care of us, listening to our requests and ensuring that everything was brought to us in a timely, complete manner. You are an example of excellent customer service!"
2648,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Location: located in Linq, it was hard to find because we used directions linked 2 yelp, parking cost $7 (for about 2hrs at hotel...45 mins of that was the wait for table on a Monday)

Food ordered:
-fried chicken Benedict: 95% mashed potatoes, barely could find the chic in the batter, but batter was tasty, the bed of spinach that it was suppose 2 b on was 2 leaves and scrambled eggs was also not portional to rest of dish
-chic pot pie: 98% potatoes and crust which was not flakey, sauce was tasty
-portions are HUGE, but you have to love potatoes!!!

Customer service:
-friendly, but it's so busy, it's hard to receive good service

Really disappointed because it has so many reviews."
2649,Hash House A Go Go,5,Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles!!! Plus the bacon waffles. That plate was massive but I had to finish the fried chicken. Had some leftover waffles though. The Arnold Palmer was made really well! I wanna try the other plates when I return. Gimme gimme gimme.
2650,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It was really good and really packed at 2am. Our server was awesome, the only reason I don't give it a four was it was surprisingly busy and I had to wait for a long time and had to wait for ranch for like 15 min"
2651,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent, large, and flavorful portions. I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant. It is a true experience that must be had when in Las Vegas. 

Please come with an empty stomach and SHARE!!"
2652,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is outstanding!! The portions were of giant proportions. I had the sage fried chicken benedict and 5 hours later i still don't want to even see food. The boneless chicken was so tender smothered in chipotle sauce, sliced tomatoes, bacon and cheeses and laying on a mound of biscuits and mashed potatoes. I could have finished it but i was trying to avoid a food coma. Also tried the blt bloody mary which more than dod the trick. Very good food for a great price. I recommend this place to any and everyone!!"
2653,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went with party of 10 on Sunday for lunch. Estimated wait time was about 1 hour for seating and 45 minutes for food.

Food ~ After waiting forever, of course I can see why this place is ""amazing"" as others posted since we're practically starving when our food comes. The portion size is HUGE so prepare to food coma afterwards. I shared the chicken and waffles with a friend which was perfect amount. There wasn't anything AMAZING about the chicken and waffles - I would say a little bit too dry. The syrup for the waffles barely helped with the dryness. HOWEVER, the watermelon lemonade was delicious! 

Location ~ It was an easy walk from where we stayed at (Vdara) especially since we were able to walk the strip and see all the stuff along the way. 

Atmosphere ~ Not much ""waiting"" room in their area so wouldn't recommend going with a big party like we did. Although, some of us went downstairs to gamble for a bit so that killed time. 

Overall ~ A good experience to check out but wouldn't come here again. The wait was too long and the food was okay. If you had limited time in Vegas like we did, we could have spent our 2 hours somewhere else."
2654,Hash House A Go Go,2,There's just way too much going on in their dishes.  I ordered the waffles and chicken.  The Rosemary just overpowered the flavor of everything else and the teriyaki sauce did not belong on the plate.
2655,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow! Lots o food!! Very above average, order 1 meal for every two people. If you don't walk away full...you must be a bottomless pit! Lots o carbs...cures a hangover!"
2656,Hash House A Go Go,5,The wait was long BUT we put our name on the wait list and just gambled for a while we waited. No big deal. The food was ENORMOUS and DELICIOUS! Our waitress was sweet and attentive. THIS PLACE IS A LAS VEGAS MUST!
2657,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was here with 5 other friends with me on a Saturday morning around 10am. We waited in a line that was for signing in our names. As we were waiting in line, we were contemplating on how long we were willing to wait. We all agreed no more than 1 hour of waiting to eat here. Yes, we felt like it was worth that time.

However, to our surprise, we only had a 5 min wait after waiting in line for about 10 min to sign our names in. Luckily there was an open table for 6, and most of the people waiting had a party of 1-4. The portions of the food were large, definitely enough to share between two people. I would like to mention that the margarita tasted like juice. I felt like there was only a tiny splash of tequila in there which I barely tasted. I had to concentrate to taste the alcohol. That was the only thing I regretted buying.

I don't 100% remember what we all got because we shared 5 plates. One was the corned beef hash (it's not the corned beef you normally would find in a can, but it's still really good) , chicken and waffles (much better at Roscoe's), snicker's pancake (humongous, can split with 4-6 people as a side dish), scramble egg whites with fruit, and smoked salmon scramble.

If you're hungry, I suggest you either come on a weekday or before 9am."
2658,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Maybe I'm bad at selecting worthwhile entrees, or maybe Hash House focuses on presentation over taste. The service is excellent, the portions are huge, the atmosphere is fun. BUT, of the three entrees I've ordered at this location, the food was bland and forgettable. Chicken & waffles look fantastic when delivered, but the chicken is dry and the sage flavoring is blah - huge disappointment and very hard to eat. The pancakes are huge but again the flavor is bland. This last time I went conservative and had a simple chicken Caesar salad and -ack- it was an anchovy based dressing. My fault this time as I know it's common and I should have asked but come on,  who actually likes anchovy Caesar dressing? Bleck. The pork cutlet and meatloaf meals the others ordered looked good. I guess I'll try one of those if I'm drug to Hash House again in the future."
2659,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Every time I come to this place I feel like they reword or remove something that I like from the menu, never the less I always leave this place completely satisfied. 
If you never been to this place it's a must. Enjoy"
2660,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Grate place to go and the Service is awesome! 
Our server John was on top of things and we had a grate time."
2661,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Long wait & a little difficult to find but worth it. Large portion size, great service and the food taste amazing."
2662,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Inside the Linq hotel you'll find a convenient spot for breakfast. The menu is small but the portions are huge. I opted for the farmers breakfast which was an omelette with avocado and bacon with mash potato hash, biscuit and fruit. The biscuit was a bit dry. Other than the size of the meal, there really isn't anything great about it. 

The servers were very courteous to my time since we were in a rush for skydiving. If you're hung over and looking for huge portions of fresh food and delicious grease, Hash house is the place to go. 

I think I need another go at this, especially the most talked about sage chicken and waffles."
2663,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Been coming to Las Vegas every year now and how could we have missed this exceptional restaurant. Great food, great service and very affordable to eat on the strip. Food and drinks were great, every bite had our taste buds going crazy. We got Andy's World Famous Sage Fried Chicken and it was great from start to finish. This plate was enough for me and my wife, the kids got ""the kids breakfast"" and the pancakes were huge. Our server (Nate) was great even thou the restaurant was slammed. Even this busy, food was on point, wait time wasn't long and service was great. This will be our go to breakfast restaurant every time we visit Vegas from now on. We recommend it....."
2664,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are HUGE, so I'd recommend sharing a plate with someone. I finished maybe 1/3 of my food. I ordered the tractor, which is a buttermilk pancake, w/ eggs and bacon. The pancake was a bit dry, I def will not order this again if I go back. My fiancÃ© ordered the chicken and waffles - he gave it 3 stars."
2665,Hash House A Go Go,5,Ate here on 12/12. The wife got the CARAMEL ALL OVER MY MOCHA very good and big! I got the SMORES COFFEE drink. Very good. It had marshmallow fluff that was torched and served with graham crackers and lots of chocolate sauce. We shared the MAN VS FOOD favorite SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT! Very good and plenty of food for 2. Service was great as well.
2666,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Definitely worth trying out when you're in Vegas. I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Like everyone else says, SHARE! It was only one of my girls and me going at the plate and we barely made a dent. Its super carby but such a guilty satisfaction. Also if you're a fan of bloody mary's, do try the BLT Mary. It was strong, had a spicy kick, and BACON. Totally won me over."
2667,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for brunch for my last day in Vegas. I wanted to have one last good meal before I left since I was busy attending a conference for work all week long and didn't get to do much outside of that. There was a long line so I opted for the bar instead and luckily there was exactly one seat open so I didn't have to wait. All the reviews on Yelp raved about their chicken and waffles so of course I went ahead and ordered that and plus, I'm a chicken and waffles fan :) Also ordered a grapefruit mimosa to go with my meal, and it was GOOD. I couldn't find or make a mimosa to match the one I had here. The portion size for the chicken and waffles was huge. It would've taken me three meals to finish it. Waffles were great (minus the bacon), I don't like pork in any form. Chicken was crispy but definitely a little under-flavored, could've used a little more seasoning. But overall, the atmosphere and service was great. Even though my dish could be improved, I'd still come back here the next time I'm in town, and yes, this meal made my tummy happy. I can say that I was satisfied."
2668,Hash House A Go Go,5,"THe second we exited Flamingo from the 15 fwy i said, ""We have to go to hash house a go go Right now!"" Thank GOODNESS!! I saw it on Man V Food and have wanted to eat here for a really really long time. So, i already pre-meditated the fact that i would probably have to wait about a hour for a table, or be on the list for next day, or whatever. Whatever the reason i was willing to wait. I just wanted to eat here really bad. 

Its at the Imperial Palace (weird hotel with lots of smokers), went left, right, south, north, couldn't find the place. Asked security for assistance, and bypassed a huge ""HASH HOUSE A GO GO"" sign above an escalator in the middle of the casino. 

This place does not disappoint. The proportions are HUGE. If you can't finish a $6 burger at Carl's Jr then split a plate with a friend. If you CAN finish a $6 burger at carl's jr then split a plate with a friend. They are GENEROUS with proportions. I was under the impression that it would be super expensive with outrageous prices, but NO i was wrong. Plates are from $11-$15, totally affordable. Its VEGAS, live it up. 

We ordered the meatloaf breakfast, HH delux (?) plate, and Andy's fried chicken benedict(as seen on Man V Food).

Meatloaf tasted interesting, came out in a skillet with chunks of potatoes and vegetables with two huge biscuit. (I swear this restaurant is for people with big appetite and with 3 stomachs). Sister said she didn't like the meatloaf entree (too bad). Other sister ordered their GIANT pancake with sausages and scrambled eggs with a side of crispy potatoes. I mean GIANT pancake. I think it was 1 ft in diameter. It was HUGE, at least 1/4 inch thick. She of course didn't finish it. I ordered Andy's chicken and biscuit (i can't remember the name but as seen on Man V Food). SOO GOOD.

HUGE biscuits with two huge fried chicken, on a bed of perfect mashed potates and strips of bacon and some special sauce. Don't forget to try their homemade JAM. Super delicious. Scoop some unto the biscuit or on some potatoes or on some mashed potatoes. Try the homemade jam. 

The table next to us were a party of 4 HUGE dudes. Macho douchebags with their artificial tan and muscles bulging from their tight ed hardy shirts. They could probably eat everything on the menu. Anyways, they all ordered burgers. They didn't finish it, and wrapped their half burgers to-go. Another table of big dudes order the chicken and waffles and had half their food boxed togo. 

So, A LOT of food. Not expensive. The hostess told us (a party of 4) would have to wait about 40 minutes, which was totally fine. Only a 30 minute wait, which flew by b/c we were reading the menu. 

 I gotta try the chicken and waffles next time! or maybe the french toast or a burger. eeeek"
2669,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Saw it on TV years ago.  Finally made it.  Was not disappointed.  A lot of times big-portion food sacrifices quality. While the portions are ridiculously obscene (which I like), the food was great.  I am a picky breakfast food person.  Eggs scrambled with cheese were fluffy and moist, sausage links were plump and flavorful.  The 14""dia, 1/2"" thick pancake was very tasty.  Will be back to sample the menu."
2670,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Whatever Gold/Diamond/Silver you be you're going to have to wait! This place is always packed! 

We came here in a group of 9 people and with diamond it took us 15-20mons for brunch!

Oooooh! You must try the pistachio coffee iced! - soooo good!!!!!

There pancake portions are for at about min 8 servings! 

All and everything on the menu comes put as generous portions! (Think of it as 1 can feed 3)

Happy grubbin!"
2671,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just ate there. One of the best meals I've had in ages. Meatloaf sandwich (the Kokomo) and banana pancakes were beyond awesome (I know, meatloaf and pancakes sounds like the meal of an insane person, but trust me it was great)."
2672,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My second time at this restaurant but went to the downtown location last time. Both times the service and food was awesome!!

My first trip, my husband and I split the chicken pot pie and still had leftovers!!  It was so good. And being from the South and Midwest, it was a reminder of what awesome comfort food tastes like!

Yesterday we had the sage chicken and waffles, which were also delicious.  We liked how the chicken didn't seem greasy. It was as though they had baked it. Stayed very crispy and tasty too.  Loved the fresh  rosemary garnish on top too :-).   The waffle was pretty good too - come to find out there was a piece of bacon wedged on the inside of the waffle!   This place just rocks food!  

We can't wait to go back and get their meat loaf and other dishes on the menu!"
2673,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I got FOOD POISONING... From their famous Sage Fried Chicken. 

I've always had good experiences but this has been an Awful Thanksgiving! I've been sick regretting dinner there. Not sure I'll be back. Probably Not. Just be AWARE!"
2674,Hash House A Go Go,5,It's worth the hype! It's worth the wait!! Big portion meals for a decent price! Very busy on the weekends for breakfast. Just put your name on the list and head down to the casino play for about an hour then go check on your name and see where you're at.
2675,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing!  Great service and fabulous food!!  Will be back for sure!!  We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles.  So good, huge portions and affordable.."
2676,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place for an affordable meal in Vegas! Get here before 10 AM if you are coming for breakfast - the line gets REALLY long. We only had to wait about 10 minutes since we arrived a little after 9 AM. The portions here are HUGE - but for the price it's one of the best deals you can find for good food in this area. I got one of the scrambles, which fortunately wasn't quite as big of a pile of food as some of the other options. The burgers, chicken & waffles, and really anything with fried chicken are giant towers of food. The pancake is the size of a steering wheel. My friend ordered the larger bowl of oatmeal thinking that surely they wouldn't give her a giant vat of oatmeal.... she received a giant vat of oatmeal. So, maybe just share a large entree with someone and get an extra side of toast or something. My scramble had smoked salmon and brie, so it was adequately decadent. I loved the GIANT biscuit that it comes with (get this instead of toast) as it was buttery, flaky, and everything you'd want in a biscuit. I ate about 75% of my plate but felt almost sick from overeating. Perhaps you have better self control than I do. 

Our service was very prompt and the server was really friendly! We got lots of coffee refills, and the coffee here is really strong. The decor was sort of 'industrial farmhouse', but mostly it was just a huge place with a lot of tables. I would recommend this restaurant for those looking for good food that won't break the bank in Vegas."
2677,Hash House A Go Go,2,Last time I was in Vegas I went the Hash House at the M Resort and had a horrible experience with the rude hostess so I decided to try another location. I ordered egg whites only well-done and my eggs were soft and runny. My boyfriend ordered his eggs over medium and his eggs were very runny. Almost like they cracked open the egg on his plate! Our server Jeffery was nowhere to be found and didn't check on us. We did have another nearby server that gladly helped us out though. I was extremely disappointed and don't think I will ever be back. Boo Hash House!
2678,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was amazing and the portions are HUGE. It's def a must try. Totally worth it.
2679,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went for brunch April 2016. I had the ""Man vs Food"" - Fried Chicken Benedict. Way more than I could eat, but was excellent. I hate that I forgot his name, but our waiter made the experience even better. He had the spiked mohawk. I would definitely go again."
2680,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best breakfast available at the LINQ. Hash is their specialty but everything else seemed reasonable and good. Definitely the busiest breakfast place in the entire casino
2681,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG!
Right off the plane we Stopped in for breakfast with my BF and cousins last time we came to LV.
The restaurant was kinda dark, rustic & METAL! Idk if that makes sense to you, but you'll see what I mean.
My cousins have been here before & warned us that the portions were huge & could be shared.  We proceeded to order our plates, individually. We each wanted different things. Chicken & waffles, biscuits & gravy, breakfast scramble(totally forgot what its called.)  When the food came out, we kinda just stared at it & laughed!!! The portions were UNBELIEVABLE! Huge stack of chicken and waffles. I almost couldnt see my cousin sitting right across me! Even though I barely made a dent in my plate, the food was AMAZING! The chicken wasnt dry, waffles werent soft/soggy - so good!"
2682,Hash House A Go Go,5,"As a steak and egg connoisseur, I seek out new places to have my favorite breakfast dish. This time around, my buddy suggested this place. And after partying all night and having only 1 hour of sleep, I need a good meal before hitting the road. We came here early, as we heard the line gets long very fast. We arrived here around 8am, and it was a 15 minute break to get seated. It took longer than usual to get our food, but this is actually normal considering how busy it gets here.
The steak and eggs here were phenomenal. The steak was cooked to perfection, and the cut was quality. The eggs were cooked well. The wheat toast and fruit added a good balance to the meal. The breakfast potatoes were good, although I did not eat too many of them.
My buddies enjoyed their meals as well. We also got some much needed coffee, which I drank about 3 cups. With 1 hour of sleep, and a 5 hour drive ahead of us, this was vital. 
A great place to have breakfast, come here early for a good meal."
2683,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The BEST chicken & waffles I've ever had in my life. Roscoe's can suck it!

I was guided here by Yelp after searching for some nearby breakfast foodstuffs. Reviews were solid, and they spoke of portions so huge they were legendary. Finding it inside the Imperial Palace was a little tricky, but a helpful security guard guided us while he told me about how ""you can't go wrong with anything"" in regards to what I should order. We got seated no problem - must have come during a lull. 

My eyes immediately locked on the Sage Chicken & Waffles once I was presented with the menu. Two succulent fried breasts of chicken placed atop a tower of four bacon waffles, coated in syrup. Call a cardiologist because I was ready to risk a heart attack for this meal. 

Of course, I can't have a big breakfast meal without a suitable beverage. Enter the B.L.T. Mary, a 20 oz. Bloody Mary made with bacon-infused vodka, all the usual fixings, and garnished with a strip of bacon, romaine lettuce and a tomato slice. It also came with a single piece of white toast that my gf noted looked like a large Melba toast. I opted out of eating it, though. 

Good thing, too, because my jaw went slack when she brought out my order. The portion was gargantuan. I quickly dove in. The chicken tasted like something sweet had been added after the deep-frying, making it ridiculously savory in addition to being extremely succulent. The waffles were so chock full of bacon that it was protruding from every seam. The combination of chicken, waffle and syrup was the experience I wanted to have at Roscoe's, but never got. The flavors were so good that I drove myself to finish off both breasts and 3 of the waffles entirely. After that, I was certain my stomach was about to explode. 

My gf got the ""basic two eggs with potatoes, bacon and fruit"" for $6.95, but there was nothing basic about it. The plate was huge, and she could barely finish it off. Even their most unassuming items are still enough food for two. Total out the door was about $35, and worth every single penny. I'll be making this my go-to breakfast spot in Vegas from now on."
2684,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We've been here so many times, but apparently I've never given a review.  This location is always busy, so expect a wait.  We've been here when the wait has only been 20 minutes and times when it has been an hour.  I definitely think it's worth it.  The waitstaff is awesome and they hustle to get you in and out.  

So far everything I have tried has been delish.  The portions are HUGE!  Hubby and I always say we are going to split something, but we never do.  We always go big!  My favorite is the chorizo hash.  The potatoes are crispy and the chorizo is very meaty and flavorful.  The fresh jalapenos brighten it up and give it quite the kick.  A huge tortilla comes with it, which you definitely need.  Hubby is a fan of anything with gravy....biscuits, chicken fried steak...it's all good.  Our son had a red velvet pancake this last time that tasted like a cupcake.  Who doesn't want a cupcake for breakfast.  But seriously...everything is good.  

The cocktails are awesome!  Again, HUGE, and so tasty.  We didn't get to partake this last time (family commitments and we had to drive), but it's definitely the place to get the party started.  Cheers!"
2685,Hash House A Go Go,2,"** bleh - if you're looking to scratch that breakfast itch BYPASS**

Completely overrated. Apparently they were shown on Diners Drive thrus and dives /DDD or whatever the name is. Their fried chicken is what their known for especially the humongous fried chicken Benedict ... which we ordered.

So their serving sizes are too large. It's enough for at least 2.

The fried chicken was okay... not too crispy and kind of gave me that gross moist breaded chicken feeling. I didnt care for the Benedict sauce, the too thick biscuit, and the fact they used Scramble eggs instead of over easy....
On
A
Eggs
Benedict
Smh 

Our order was $15 smh . Oh and the guy accidentally authorized my credit card for more than I was supposed to pay .smh"
2686,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We patiently waited for our food for 45mins without getting any updates. Finally when it hit an hour I went to find our server, Amanda. She was no where to be found. I asked other servers and they walked in the kitchen, spoke to her, and told me ""she'll be right out with you."" Waited another five minutes with no word from her. We ended up just leaving. No apologies from anyone. Wasted an hour."
2687,Hash House A Go Go,5,It was sooo busy and the wait was nuts but worth it! That Indiana chicken and waffles was soooo fire! We will definitely be back. The staff was on point and helped us with everything we needed. I had other friends that came a separate time and sent pics of other dishes that I gotta try next time! Great spot!!
2688,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Many of my friends have raved about this place and for that reason I gave it a shot.  I will be upfront and tell you I think this place is all hype.  If all you care about is getting a big plate of food than you will be in fat kid heaven.  If you however like your food to have good flavor than I would encourage you to look else where.  

I got the chicken and waffles.  The portions were huge and could share this meal for sure.  The chicken was really dry and lacked flavor.  Tasted like breaded chicken that hadn't been seasoned yet.  The waffles tasted like instant pancake mix with microwaved bacon in the middle.  This is the ultimate place that people like just because it is trendy.  I won't eat there again."
2689,Hash House A Go Go,5,We sat at the bar and the bartenders were super attentive. Food was absolutely delicious! Huge portions and an amazing Bloody Mary!
2690,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I went to the Hash House A GoGo located in the Imperial Palace on Dec 29th. My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast. It was pretty crowded, but I expected that for it to be such a famous place. We had to wait for about 30 minutes, which isn't bad. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Hardwood Smoked Bacon Waffle, which was FABULOUS! The chicken tasted like home fried chicken, the bacon was very flavorful and the waffles were cooked to perfection. My meal was very filling, that was the only meal I ate all day. My boyfriend had the pancake combo, which came with one large pancake, when I say large I mean the size of a car rim, eggs and hickory smoked chicken sausage links. Everything was very good."
2691,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Bless the souls at Hash Hash A Go Go that dealt with our less-than-sober selves. Most 24 hour restaurants are pretty awful but I must say Hash Hash is changing the game. We had great service and great food in ridiculous portions (luckily I saw some plates so shared a main). The bill was very reasonable, especially for Vegas and there was bacon IN the waffles and they were delicious.

The only weird thing is that they were making people wait for tables when the place was at least 70% empty. Strange logic there but hey, I was inebriated and they were nice and we left full. Touche guys!"
2692,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Who can't love this place? Everything they serve is over the top and tastes great. I tend to order the Sage chicken and waffles each time but I've tried tow or three other items and have never been disappointed. 

If you get there when it opens you'll likely have to wait but it's absolutely worth waiting for."
2693,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went a few Saturdays ago...when we got there, it was an hour wait. This was expected since it's a Saturday in Vegas at a popular restaurant. 
We went to the high roller which is at the same location (linq promenade) to kill time. It's a 30 min ride in a glass enclosed cabin with or without a bar and unlimited drinks...I recommend for excellent views of Las Vegas.
By the time we got back our table was ready.
I got the signature sage chicken and bacon waffles. It is a big portion and it's delicious.
I also tried the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were light and fluffy and the gravy was spot on.
I'm a huge bloody mary fan and I really enjoyed the signature Hash mary. I even got to keep the glass.
I really wish they had a Hash House closer to me in Philly or New York because I can't wait to go back!"
2694,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge portions and great presentation, but the food isn't very flavorful. Last time we went, we waited a lot longer than they originally told us. We noticed some people were being seated before us, even though they came way after us. After complaining, they sat us down. This was our second time here and I'm still not impressed. There are so many better breakfast places in vegas. This will be our last time."
2695,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It's a good place to take your guests when they come to town but for a local it's mediocre. The portion size is huge, but the flavor is bland. Everything needs a little more salt and a lot more flavor.  I have tried both their locations and this one is still better than all of them."
2696,Hash House A Go Go,5,Chicken and bacon filled waffles. Can't go wrong!  Plenty to split a meal!
2697,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've been dying to try one of these after seeing it on man v food and here in Vegas it's possibly one of the best options.

Now be prepared to wait and the linq hotel is just ok but they are FAST! 25min wait turned out to be 15min.  

I DID not get the chicken and waffles eventhough they looked huge and delicious and maybe 50% of the patrons get it... no one finishes it!!! 

I got a custom scramble to my dietary needs very good, good portion.  Service was sweet and the OJ top notch.

I'll be back!"
2698,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came back for the 3rd time here.. It add to my amusement when I see people with their big Eyes soon as the food comes out.. Best part of this trip was Travis our server!! His very consistent with his introduction to his customers .. Love how he explains the menu to his customers..Travis 5 stars for you buddy...
2699,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just get the Sage Fried Chicken... Its worth it. If you have not try it ever, just do it once. You can always To GO the rest.  Pretty damn goood. Long line but it is worth the wait. There is a long line for a reason. So good   you will wait for about an hour. Worth every second to wait. Cool friendly servers and service. I would recommend getting the number and play a couple of slots until they call your name."
2700,Hash House A Go Go,3,"While in Vegas, my friend insisted that we had to eat at Hash House. We came as a group of 12 on a busy Saturday morning. The hostess told us the wait would be about an hour or more. So, we split up into groups of 4, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes instead. Not bad at all!

My group ordered 3 dishes (way more than enough for 4 hungry people!) Me and two other friends shared the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Meatloaf Hash. Both were delicious! We were so hungry and tired (from the night before!), that I can't even remember what was all in our food. I just remember it being delicious. 

The restaurant was super busy and service was kind of slow, but the food was definitely worth the wait! I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
2701,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I never leave Vegas without hitting HHAGG at least once, they earn they're great reputation every day. Don't miss this treat on your trip, service is outstanding, and even though they're always packed, I've never had to wait for a table over ten minutes. Try the Sage Chicken and waffles, but come hungry!"
2702,Hash House A Go Go,5,A lot of family told me about this place and that it was a great place to eat. Prices were a bit high but the plates of food were huge and worth it. The food is share worthy but depends on how drunk you are. Make sure to read the things up the escalator ride.
2703,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Big food but good taste. I have never been able to finish my serving but always have something for lunch the next day.  I have had really great service here and absolutely horrid service. So its hit and miss. I am not a fan of things on my plate or poking into my food that is not meant for consumption but they do it regardless of my opinion. 
Overall I enjoy the food but is a place we have to plan to eat at or make it our last stop. Those leftovers can't be left in the car or even worse, left on the plate. 
Oh BTW, if you like chicken pot pie. Try theirs. Its delicious and even better the next day."
2704,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fantastic breakfast! Ordered the chicken and asparagus hash. Yummy. Big breakfast, good service. Get their early, because the line gets long. We were there for 7am and walked right in. My husband had the banana pancake, which is really too big for one person. I had to help! Best pancake ever :)"
2705,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great hangover recovery meal. On a labor weekend Sunday around 3pm there was a 10min wait to get a table. We has a brunch there after a night out and they have pretty good food. My girlfriend and I ordered the corn beef hash and the andy's sage chicken. Both were delicious! The food portions are very large, we left a lot on the plates and we walked out with the feeling we could had more."
2706,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy mother....biggest portions I've ever seen!  DELICIOUS, DECADENT, FATTENING but ohsoworthit FOOD!

Just go.  I can't even put into words how f'n amazing their food is.  

Ps. If you decide to share a plate...they do charge a fee for it."
2707,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Having seen this place on Man vs Food it became a must try for me on my next trip to Vegas. I walked quite a distance to come here, all the way from the MGM Grand where I was staying. It was well worth it. The portions are as big as they say. I am quite a big eater and I would have had to eat until I was sick to make all gone here. I had the Fried Chicken Benedict and it was very good and a bargain for the $14 price. My wife had a scramble which was actually a reasonable sized portion. The wait wasn't too bad and the service was not as slow as people make it out to be. Definitely a destination spot on the strip. Otherwise I never would probably ever set foot in the Imperial Palace."
2708,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When in Vegas, Hash House A Go Go has been a destination for me and my friends. Whether you're hungover or just plain ole hungry, you will leave this place satisfied.

Location: Hash House A Go Go is located at the Linq hotel off the strip. The restaurant is on the second floor above the casino. If you cant find it, just ask one of the many helpful employees at the casino. They will be happy to assist you. Once you do find the restaurant, be prepared to wait. The minimum wait is ball park 45 minutes to an hour. You can put your name down and gamble if you like but make sure your entire party is there when they call your name. 7/10

Food: The portions are epic here. Their Corn Beef Hash is delicious. The corned beef is served with potatoes and onions, two eggs, a biscuit the size of a softball, and a bowl of fruit. I like my eggs over easy and I break the yolk over everything. I've also ordered the Chicken and Waffles here and it was pretty good. The plate is literally a tower of food. A bed of sweet, crunchy Texas sized waffles. Two crispy fried chicken breasts stacked on top of one another w/ a knife driving through it all. I like my syrup on the side and dip as I go. Each dish was decently priced around $15. I wish I had pictures of these plates but go see for yourself.  7/10

Service: Every time I've eaten here was during brunch w/ a slight hangover. It's busiest around this time but the staff do a really good job checking on your table. Food came out around 20-25 minutes. 7/10

You're gonna wait to eat everywhere in Vegas. Might as well wait at Hash House A Go Go and check out there huge portions."
2709,Hash House A Go Go,4,Had the chicken and waffles. Definitely tasty and fresh but I think the batted could use some spice. It was rather plain. But the waffles were perfect -and who can disagree with fresh fried chicken at 6am?
2710,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When we arrived, the waiting area was packed! The wait was estimated for a 15-20 so the men decided to grab a bloody Mary and us ladies took a few pics and next thing you know we were being seated. 

Once we sat down our server came over immediately and took our drink orders and I chose to get one of the specialty drinks that came in a neat souvenir glass. Everyone had pretty much decided what was being order and from then it was on!

- Sage chicken and waffles that include, Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks -AWESOME SAUCE

-Corned Beef, red onions and Swiss cheese  -AWESOME SAUCE

-Griddled HH meatloaf & 2 eggs served with mashed potatoes, fruit & biscuit - Now of course my husband had to be different and go against the grain and order this and he  was disappointed but he is lucky I love him so I shared my chicken and waffles and hash with him (yes I order both, I mean you only live once right)

The portions were huge and it took us the rest of the trip to finish it! 

This has been added to my favorite places to eat in Vegas."
2711,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is place so GOOD! We showed up around 11AM on Friday morning. We had a party of 5 and were quoted that it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait. We were seated just after an hour. I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken, and Oh My F&^%! It was DELICIOUS! I totally recommend it, it filled me up for the ENTIRE day! LITERALLY!

Line - YES! 45-an hour wait
Food - worth it!
Price - My wife and I paid $33 BEFORE tip

Park at Imperial Palace or Flamingo's and just walk from there. Self park it to save some cash, unless you want to valet it."
2712,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge huge huge portions!  There were 10 of us the came here for lunch.    Seated us fairly quickly. All of us got different things and the portions were all big enough for three of me. My wife and I had the 24 ounce bloody Mary's called the BLT bloody with bacon lettuce tomato and a piece of toast. Tasty but not fantastic. I got the pork tenderloin with eggs Benedict on top of it covered the entire plate. Again it was good but not fantastic. Service was really good and fast. Next time we're definitely getting stuff to share.
2713,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Service was excellent, wait wasn't too bad. Food was not worth the hype! Portions were out of this world big, hit taste of it was not as great as as the food look. 
I gave them a 4 star due to the service!"
2714,Hash House A Go Go,4,Was told by many to try hash house. Walked into the restuarant. I wasn't that impressed thought it just looked like any other place. But it didn't dissappoint. Awesome bloody mary & the vanilla dipped french toast wow I need to figure out how to make it this good at home. Tried a bite of my friend's waffles & fried chicken mind blowing. If your are ever near one it's worth it.
2715,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service : (3/5) was so so. Our server was Kendra or something like that. Last name Compton for sure. She was a super nice server. Gave us recommendations for drinks and always had a smile on our face. Delightful. 
Although, we did wait for our food for about 40 minutes ... Or maybe an hour... And I read some reviews where they said they can take up to 30 mins to bring out your food.. So we waited Patiently. Til we saw other people ordering seconds and actually got theirs before us.. So that's when we go ... Wtf....
So Kendra comes to us and told us that she was gonna go check on our food . Then she comes out and told us that our food was already done 20 mins ago.. And it was just sitting there ... Again..... WTFFF.... 
And she apologized and told us that the manager or kitchen manager is going to come out personally and bring us our food.
He came out with our hot plates and apologized and gave us one of our dishes for free . Thank you kind sir. 

Now to the important part... 

F O O D 

Sage fried chicken and Benedict (3/5)
- the eggs weren't Benedict like at all. It's more like scrambled . There wasn't enough sauce for all that meat ! The mash was alright. The portions are hugeeeee. It's only famous for the size. Tasting wise... It's so so.. 


Sage fried chicken and waffles (3/5)
- same as above for taste of chicken. The meat wasn't dried. And instead of mash, there were waffles. I didn't try the waffle though."
2716,Hash House A Go Go,5,"THEIR CHICKEN POT PIE IS A MUST. It will definitely leave a an unforgettable impression on ya. Not only is it the most creamy, rich, and comforting chicken pot pie I've tried, the presentation is an eye turner and it's enough to feed two voracious adults. 

I've finally tried their watermelon lemonade and it was as refreshing as it looks and sounds. SIP. WHOOSH. YUM!

Do yourself right, and go try the pot pie and of course their famous Fried Chicken and Waffle Tower. I love their rosemary infused waffles..... drool....

I love the fact that it's 24 hours in the city that never sleeps. How suitable!"
2717,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great service. Amazing food. Huge servings (good to feed a starving couple that will fill them the whole day). Always worth the wait. 


They definitely need to open one in LA!"
2718,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Every time we come to Vegas, Hash House is one of our top priorities! They simply have the best food, best portions and fabulous drinks. How can you go wrong with food featured on Man vs Food?!

The amount of food in one meal is definitely enough for two people, so order wisely unless you want leftovers. The bf and I learned after our first visit to just order one plate with a side. 

The BLT Bloody Mary is my favorite brunch cocktail of all time! It has the perfect amount of spice and they even include a mayo packet in case you want to make a BLT out of the garnish. 

The wait is a pain, but our friend was a Diamond member of the rewards club at the casino, so we bypassed the line completely. Score!"
2719,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are HUGE! I kid you not, two of us shared the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (which was super tasty by the way...) but we still could not finish the plate! We were pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was, and our waitress was super attentive and lovely. Only critique would be that it wasn't really a Benedict as it was without a poached egg!"
2720,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The Hash House a go go is a Vegas staple for us. This place is not a deal by any means so order wisely or you will likely end up disappointed. Previously we tried the ""prawns"" these were the shrimpiest of shrimps hardly a prawn, a mega letdown compared to the menus photo. The machaca was delicious and not an oversized portion a nice rarity for the joint. 

This time we went for the Blue crab cake sandwich, while it was good you will get more bang for your buck if you order just the crab cakes and forgo the bun. The fires are good crispy on the outside soft on the inside. We always get an order of the fried Chicken and waffles, you can't beat this meal as it must be their flagship item. Comes with two chicken breast deep fried in corn flake cereal it's amazing. The waffles are made with the bacon inside them adding to devilish deliciousness. To top it off they cover the fried chicken and waffle tower with fried leaks maybe my favorite part of the dish.

Wait staff is total hit or miss, during our summer visit we scored! They sat us in our prefers location away from everyone so we could settle in for a nice meal and recuperation. We prefer to take our time  and didn't feel rushed by our waitress, she was so sweet I wish I remembered her name! This time, not so lucky when we asked the host for a more private location she just nervously laughed and sat the menus on the table. Eye roll hard. Our waitress was sweet but a bit scatter brained for reasons I can only speculate to so I won't. 

So in review so far the chicken and waffles is where it's at and just know you may have to ask a few times to get exactly what you want and at an average bill of $55 for 2 plates and drinks you want just that."
2721,Hash House A Go Go,2,"They have an interesting menu, we ordered a skillet and a salmon platter for breakfast. 

On the plus side the mashed potatoes were pretty good.   The biscuits were large and pretty good as well - a tad dry though.  We really liked the home made jam!  They did not offer any butter or anything else for the biscuits, we could have asked but did not.

I asked for my eggs over medium... they came out cold and runny and I could not eat them.  The salmon was cold... was it supposed to be?  The skillet came with a lump of cheese on one side, the rest had little to none so they did not do a good job of ""mixing it up"". 

For the amount of money we spent for breakfast (about $25 after taxes) we should have walked out of there very well satisfied."
2722,Hash House A Go Go,5,Absolutely loved the chicken and waffles!  My husband I shared the dish and we both came away stuffed.  My daughter ordered the chocolate pancake and could only finish a 1/4.  My son ordered the bacon waffle and loved it.  I can't believe we came away paying less than $35 for dinner.  Can't wait to try something else.
2723,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Stopped here on the way to Arizona.

Their sage chicken and waffles is enormous! 2 pieces of fried chicken and 5 bacon waffles - Bring a big appetite. 

Though we were left unattended for at the reception, the waitress who took care of us was attentive and swift."
2724,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So much variety, great ingredients, and wonderful presentation! We had 6 people and got in right away at 11 on a Wednesday. Billy was one of the best waiters I've ever had. Loved the experience."
2725,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ate breakfast here and the portions are huge enough to share! Even the kids size is big too. Got the Chicken & Waffles and it's delicious! It gets a bit loud but that's okay, was busy grubbin on the food. A must place to try and plus it's 24 hours!"
2726,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just as other Yelpers say, the wait is long - but well worth it! Restaurant is located inside a hotel which was a liiiiittttle tricky to find since there aren't really signs outside. 

Take note that the portion sizes are massive. While the pancake I had was the size of Saturn (minus rings), it was hands down the best blueberry pancake I've ever had. And I've had a lot of pancakes. My meal also came with fresh toast, eggs, and perfectly crispy bacon. Not to sound dramatic, but its been nearly a week has gone by since I've been here and I still think about this exact meal. 

My bf was very satisfied with his breakfast as well, even though he only ordered a basic two eggs/toast/bacon combo. 

Definitely worth the wait!"
2727,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Giving this a 1 star because it is definitely over rated by other yelpers.  Long wait, cold food, over priced. No thanks. 

Arrived at 1015am on Tuesday morning.  35 min wait for 2 people. I ordered the famous man vs food fried chicken eggs Benedict and my husband got the banana pancake trucker combo. 1130am by the time we got our food and Both plates were served cold, my ""famous biscuits"" were as hard as a rock couldn't even stab it with my fork (i demonstrated for the waitress Liz) lol more like a crouton biscuit.  I sent mine back to be remade. But my husband was scarfing his cold pancakes and bacon because he had to attend a conference at noon. His pancakes were actually good tasting but super sweet and a lil under done.  My 2nd plate arrived shortly after, this time hand delivered by the manager himself, butttt was cold again. Seriously WTH.  Ate the side of fruit and rushed out. Btw, they didn't even comp the cold plate, not even a discount. $46 for 2 breakfasts with ice water.... overrated and over priced. I honestly wouldn't even go back if i had a free voucher. Go to McDonald's next door instead :) spend the money elsewhere!"
2728,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is tucked in The Linq hotel but boy was it a great find. My wife and I ordered the chicken and Waffles and a Snickers Flapjack. The chicken and waffles were cooked very nicely with bacon inside the waffle! It was really juicy and delicious. The flapjack was huge but made for good leftovers the next day. 

Worth the wait to eat here, great for families, you wont leave hungry:)"
2729,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We ate here Sunday night and all 3 people who got chicken meals ended up getting sick last night.  I had the oven roasted chicken dinner, which was the most bland meal I've ever had in my life.  My other friends got the chicken and waffles and the chicken strips.  All of us commented on how the food was a whole lot of whatever... and it turns out we were poisoned.  Thanks a lot for the memories, Hash House."
2730,Hash House A Go Go,4,The wait is definitely always long so try to go at odd hours but this is Vegas.. Any hour is busy. The portions are very big. For every plate you could share it between 2 or even 3 people. We typically like to order family style. The chicken and waffles is always a must and the chicken fried steak is actually pretty good as well. Nicely breaded and the chicken isn't overcooked. This location is in the middle of the Linq casino and you go up the escalators.
2731,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great portion sizes and awesome food. This is a must try. The staff is very friendly and the prices are affordable as well.
2732,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Holy Huge waffles batman!


The place is Imperial Palace, which is a really shady and old casino. Good thing they're remodeling it. Hopefully Hash House will be cleaner and newer looking too. As of right now it is like old vegas or reno feel to it. 

The food is OK. The portions are ridiculous. Got the Waffle and man its bigger than the wheels on my car!!! No way I can finish. too bad the taste wasn't as big. 

The wait wasn't too bad, but the food took FOREVER to come out! It wasn't even that busy. Oh well, hopefully they can fix this once it remodels too."
2733,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I had heard good things about this place and decided to try it for breakfast.  Arrived on a Monday morning at 9am and waited about a fifteen minutes to be seated.  Hostesses were very nice and there was plenty of seats for waiting.

We ordered coffee and the recommended dish by our waitress was the Man vs Food dish  
 ""The eggs benedict."" It included biscuit, cheese, mash potatoes,slices tomatoes, small sprinkling of spinach, scrambled eggs, bacon , some spicy sauce and a piece of fried chicken with way to much breaking.  Carb overload.  It was not a healthy start to my day.  But I knew that When I ordered it 

I was disappointed - very dry and not so good.  I picked through it wishing for more spinach.  The bis ages were big and dry I asked for some jam and the waitress brought a tiny little cup of peach preserves - that was the best part of the meal.

The drip coffee was good and the waitress was great in keeping our cups full."
2734,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food was very unique and fantastic!! Comfort food with a gourmet twist!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the servings are huge! More than most people can eat. Order to share!
2735,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Was excited to try this place, but wasn't a huge fan. Take out food takes forever. Food is mediocre."
2736,Hash House A Go Go,4,Good food and great service.  We went on a busy Saturday morning.  The wait was less then an hour and parties were getting seated rapidly.  Once at you table our waiter was attentive and welcoming.  The food was good and had very very large portions.  The staff was always available and was ready to help us before we realized we had a question.
2737,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG can you say food overload? Yes thats what you get here.

We all came here after playing the daily slot tournament and waiting for the results of the winners (one of us did win the $500!) we found this place in the Imperial Palace and decided to take a break and get some food.  Well thats an understatement! The portions are HUGE and everything was s fresh and yummy.  Its a comfort food joint for sure.  Our lunch consisted of 3 different burgers and one Quesadilla.  The burgers are ""stuffed"" you choose the items you want inside and they pout between the two patties.  One of us had the bacon and mashed potato stuffed burger, one was mushrooms and swiss, and the other bacon, cheddar and avocado.  Only one of us was able to finish the whole burger the other two of us saved 1/2 for dinner.  The Quesadilla was huge and over flowing and resting on a bed of mashed potatoes which I was told were amazing.  The side of Macaroni and Cheese was said to be the best Mac and Cheese every tasted by 3 in the party so creamy and cheesy it was the ultimate comfort food to drown our gambling losses! LOL  

I recommend this gem which is on the second floor inside Imperial Palace and a reasonable priced place considering the quantity and quality of food you receive. Especially compared to the rest of the places on the strip that leave you broke AND disappointed. 

Only this that would make this place perfect is to get some cell service inside....No AT&T service at all in the restaurant, so if you have others who are gambling or trying to find you, your off the grid in here.....which could be a good thing, you can concentrate on the food-gazm your gonna have!"
2738,Hash House A Go Go,3,"WoW! Hash House A Go Go huh? I hadn't even heard of this place until a friend of mine mentioned he had seen it on Man vs Food and really wanted to check it out. Well at first I drove down to the other location to find out that there was another location at the Imperial Palace. Who knew?

Everyone finally made it to the correct location and we were seated. I guess the food takes a while since the portions are GIGANTIC and there were like 16 of us but everything went pretty well. 

Man. I had no idea HOW HUGE the portions were going to be here but they weren't kidding. I think I could've shared my meal with like 4 people. Seriously. I ended up getting small plates and having bites of stuff on each plate to have for my meal.

You must get the biscuits and gravy side! UGH. It's SO good. I do love biscuits and gravy and man I loved theirs. They had pieces of chunky sausage in it and it was just yummy.

We ordered the Man vs Food meal with the fried chicken and stuff. It was good but definitely overwhelming. I didn't get through much of the meal but it wasn't bad. There's just too much going on!

Our waiter was pretty good and did pretty well getting everything out. One of my friend's meals took forever and he ended up just taking his burger for the car ride because it came after everyone was pretty much done eating. 

It's something to try but I don't think I'll be coming back. It was just too much.

Also, at the end of the meal you think to yourself how much we waste. Eek."
2739,Hash House A Go Go,5,"After seeing pictures of the famous sage fried chicken, my dream to finally try it has come true! :')

After waking up at 3pm ... (remember, we're in Vegas)... so hungry. I wanted nothing more but to generously stuff my face. 

The portions are huge! All I could do at first was just stare at the humongous size. Well, only for half a second before my mouth began to attack the prey. 

1). Sage Fried Chicken - stacked with the famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks
2). Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs
3). House Smoked Fresh Salmon, cream cheese and scallions - House Hash - Tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit

Where do I begin. The sage fried chicken was so moist. OMG. Delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and has the right crisp when you bite into it. Juicy goodness. The bacon waffle was super good and it paired perfectly with the crispy chicken. The waffle was light, crispy, and fluffy! There were huge bacon bits in the waffle ... the combination of salty and sweet was amazing. Their homemade maple syrup drizzled on top of it ... MMM. Just made it even more amazing. 

The benedict was also good! CHIPOTLE cream sauce. Yummy. My only complaint was that they put a little too much cream sauce on top. It was a little hard to taste what I was eating since there was just so much sauce all over the dish.

The house hash salmon was decent! There was a good amount of salmon in the hash. The potatoes were cooked perfect! The scrambled eggs that came with it was nothing amazing.The biscuit was the size of two fists! O_o 

We had a bunch of leftovers for the next day! :D

GREAT SERVICE. FOOD COMES FAST!

Pure comfort food:)"
2740,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This restaurant was highly recommended by friends. When we arrived we could tell it must be great due to the size of the crowd. The wait was an hour and 5 mins. The food took 30 mins to arrive. The service was not very good. I ordered the crab cake Benedict . The crab cake was the best I've had on this side of the country. However, the biscuits it was served on were cold and the hollandaise sauce was too spicy. There is no warning on the menu about the spice factor. The mashed potatoes looked great but had too much pepper. I couldn't eat those either.  I had hoped the the food would be worth the wait but neither the service or the food was worth it.   My husband did enjoy his apple cinnamon flapjacks.  Hubby says not to go on a weekend, possibly better service on a slower day."
2741,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious!!!
I had the griddles French toast. I don't even like bananas but the way they cooked them and served them was fantastic! The chicken sausage was pretty good as well.

The service was great as well. We got there at 10am and didn't wait too long.

We're going back tomorrow since we leave Saturday!"
2742,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The past few times I've been to Vegas I make it a point to always come back here. Specifically for the pancakes and the s'mores latte. Be warned the pancakes are HUGE, so come hungry. In fact all the servings here are enormous, and tasty. In the mornings the line is long so come early."
2743,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went here for a non traditional thanksgiving feast with my family of 5. Wait was minimal, service outstanding, food...wow. Everyone was happy. The chicken and waffles lives up to the hype and then some. My daughter was able to order a traditional thanksgiving dinner with turkey and all the trimmings. The biscuit bowl with biscuits the size of softballs with honey butter were a big hit. Did not partake in their famous Bloody Mary with the bacon garnish but have added them to my to drink list. Thank you HHaGG. Best Thanksgiving ever!"
2744,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I ordered it just to see if I could finish it. The chipotle mayo gives every mouthful a burst of flavor. And it's deliciousness was only surpassed by how full it made me. 
I left one bite so it could earn the other dishes I would be back ;)"
2745,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Time for brunch this is one of the popular places in Vegas to visit so here we are 

Review: with all the hype we decided to see for our selves  the chicken and waffles is the most talked about item so we went for it ; big mistake the  chicken was bland had a funny taste and absolutely no flavor or seasoning I guess looks can be deceiving the only good about this dish was the presentation on the plus side the portions are huge the service was good but this dish just wasn't it! After trying other brunch places in Vegas maybe I'll come back and try something different"
2746,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went last week on our trip to Vegas after seeing them on Man V Food.  Loved it!

Got there and told it'd be about 30 minutes to get a table and we wanted to go back downstairs to gamble, so we asked for a pager.  She said to not go too far or it wouldn't work.  After 30 minutes we came back up to check and they'd called us 5 minutes earlier (pager didn't work cuz I guess we went too far). But they quickly seated us anyway, so that was great.

Service was good.  Only thing that would have been better is if they'd checked on us a bit more and refilled drinks more often.  But that's often the case with the average restaurant that's so busy you're waiting to get a table.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.

I ordered the sage chicken benedict and my husband had the banana pecan french toast.  We're pretty big eaters and he did manage to clean his plate, but I could only do about half of mine, even though it was delicious.  If you're with someone you can share a meal with and can come to an agreement on what to order (so much to choose from) then I suggest sharing.  Because it tastes so amazing you want to keep eating and you'll totally overeat.

This was probably the best breakfast meal out that I've had in years!  I have even decided that anytime I go to LA, I will drive to San Diego just so I can eat here.  

I also used a restaurant.com coupon with no problems!"
2747,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I'm generally never one to complain, much less even post about a restaurant, but I must say this had to be one of the top 5 worst dining experiences on record.

At 11:45am on December 8th, six of us went for breakfast/lunch, and were told there would be an hour wait...  Sure, no problem, we had been there multiple times before and had zero issues with the wait, we actually expected it. At around the 50 minute mark we checked back in just to be on the safe side, and were told it was close.  Needless to say, 45 minutes later (so now over an hour and a half wait) they were sitting multiple groups of 4 that put their names in while we were checking in at the 50 minute mark.  It took me standing at the host/hostess table (which by the way had at least 5 employees standing around it) for them to finally sit us.  Low and behold, the dining room was at most, 50% capacity.  I even asked why they couldn't have made the 5 to 6 groups they let go in front of us wait while they pushed two table together, and I got the deer in the headlights look.

Ok, it gets better.  Ordered the famous BLT Bloody's, and they came without the B.  Not a big deal even though it's their claim to fame so to speak, but we were already a bit agitated to be honest...oh well, we blew it off and the server brought a plate of bacon.  

Finally our food comes out...well four (4) of the six (6).  The two missing orders, which were the Sage Chicken & Waffles never came...well correction, one order came out, but after the other 4 of us were done with our meals.  The waiter was protesting that sometimes it takes a while to make the chicken & waffles, and when we said we came here multiple times, then he said ""well sometimes it comes out first.""  Make up your mind man!  So the last order actually never came, even after we addressed all of this with the Manager.  

The Manager just looked at us like himself and his staff were doing us a favor by letting us eat there.  Nothing he said even suggested he cared! 

So the food is great, if it ever comes.  Worst staff ever!  I will never go back and we tell all our friends the same story!"
2748,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was alright but nothing amazing, though the scrambled eggs with ham/bacon is real good. Service was excellent. Serving was humongous, better shared among two persons. I only managed to finish half the plate."
2749,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Chicken and Waffles. That should be all I have to say to get you to Vegas to try these amazing chicken and waffles! I loved every bite .. and if you like bacon you'll most certainly enjoy their bacon stuffed waffles. 
This is a MUST TRY"
2750,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could.  Really yummy, creative comfort food with giant portions and relatively low cost.  Will definitely go again on our next trip!"
2751,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow! Great Breakfast everything is great! Huge pancakes and waffles had the jalapeÃ±o and chorizo hash it was great fresh OJ.
2752,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was one of my favorite meals on our vacation to Las Vegas. I ordered the pumpkin flapjack, which was delicious and enormous, but I think the reason the food here stood out to me so much was because I also ate a lot of the quesadilla my husband ordered, and it was AMAZING. It had potatoes and eggs and jalapenos, and it was just perfect. My pancake was great too, but I love being able to have something a little spicy/savory too sometimes."
2753,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is one of the best places to go for lunch (or brunch). The very first time I ate here was at the M Casino. I don't get anything else here, but the Andy's Famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which is a fresh split biscuit with tomato, spinach, smoked bacon, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream scrambled eggs with mash potatoes. I first saw this on Man vs Food, so it was a definite must to try. It was very tasty with a lot of different elements to it that all seem to work together. Two people can split this meal and it would be more than enough to last you until your next meal of the day."
2754,Hash House A Go Go,4,"OK, first things first.. My date was hyping this joint up a lot for the breakfast spot of all breakfast spots on the strip. She claimed they had the biggest portions and I was all like ""sure, sure, we'll see"" She was absolutely correct on that point.

This place has a strangely mid-western gourmet take on breakfast, portions are huge and quality is right up there with the diners from Indiana to Topeka. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash & Eggs (AWESOME!) my date got the new age Eggs Benedict with a creamy roasted red pepper hollandaise sauce with biscuits instead of english muffins. All in all this place was fantastic and is sure to cure even the worst Vegas hangover. Only downside is wait times are pretty long due to it's popularity."
2755,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ill be honest. I had one goal and one goal only when I wend to Vegas.... this place

The wait for this place when we went (with a large group) was one hour. Do I complain... not a bit. great excuse to play a table game and get my dink on downstairs  in the casino. Once our friend got the call that the table was ready that's when the excitement set in. I look in the menu and duh I order the chicken Benedict thing! That dish came out and I started feeling full! The portions were soooooo large! Like seriously a family of four could have at this dish. I finished what I could and I must say that it was very delish!!!! Everything was cooked to perfection and well seasoned and that chipotle cream sauce changed my life!!!

The prices (considering the portions) were very good. The over all cleanliness of the restaurant was very good! that place gets a lot of business moving in and out so im sure its easy to keep a place like that spotless, but they do a very good job. The staff was very friendly and accomidating as well. We had a friend who has some dietary restrictions and they had no problems helping her out. 

I must say that the next time I return to Vegas this will be on the top of my list of places to go!!"
2756,Hash House A Go Go,1,Bad service and I hardly write any reviews but it felt like ppl at this restaurant were biased and only served upper classes. I was here before two other tables and they got their foods before we did and we had a less party. I don't recommend this place.
2757,Hash House A Go Go,3,I normally  love this place but the wait and service  was so slow. I ordered biscuits  and gravy but they were hard and dry. Very disappointed.  Huge portions
2758,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was worried this place wouldn't live up to the hype but it was even more amazing than I expected! We came around noon on a Saturday and were told the wait was an hour and 15 minutes. We were seated in about 45 minutes and after that, the service was FAST. These guys don't mess around. We had our drinks, order taken and food delivered in a span of 15 minutes. The portions are huge and the flavor is on point! I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!"
2759,Hash House A Go Go,1,"""The waffles taste like Marlboro Lights but the chicken is good."" 

""This is the worst hamburger I've ever had but I'm not going to ask for a refund, I ate half of it.""


This place is the Drake of restaurants. Big and flashy but soft and mostly pretend."
2760,Hash House A Go Go,1,I was not impressed. I was with a group of five. It took thirty minutes for one order to come out and forty minutes to get a small side salad. Then three of us had to wait another 20 minutes to get our food while our other friend ate. The table next to us was having the same problem. When we asked the server who brought out the salad where our food was he told us it was not problem and to tell someone else. After the long wait I got a chicken sandwich that was over cooked and the bun was to hard to eat. I will not be coming back here.
2761,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You HAVE to go to this restaurant.  I first heard about it from some friends who had made reservations for all of us for breakfast.  I said ""reservations, for breakfast??"" Well, it is such a popular place, even on a Thursday morning, that you had better make those reservations!   Good food, lots-o-food, and good times to be had.  Service a little slow, but the place was packed, so I understood.
Wild name for a restaurant, too!"
2762,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I took the andy's chicken with eggs and bacon, it's not a place for people with small appetite, the meals are very big, prices weren't so cheap because of the size of it, I'll be honest the taste was fantastic, but it didn't look that good or attractive"
2763,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So I got a two for one dinner coupon and had my heart set on the fried chicken and waffles.  

Damn, that portion was just ridiculous.  Chicken was crisp and juicy.  Even the breast meat.  I don't even remember the meatloaf but I think it was good too.  

Three ladies shared that and the meatloaf entree and I swear, we could've fed our husbands/bfs with that amount of food.

Who eats this much???  

Welcome to 'Merica.  

Oh yeah, service was awesome!  Even though I had a coupon, he didn't make a big deal like some places would.  Well done!"
2764,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was pretty good. Service was a little slow and the server was a little forgetful, but if you like big portions then this is the place for you. My favorite is the corned beef hash and chicken and waffles. I will definitely eat here again as it wasn't my first time. Good location within the really nice Linq hotel."
2765,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was everything I could imagine and more. It's difficult to find a place where you can get great size portion of food for a great price. This is one of the few. Highly recommended. 
I only had breakfast but it was all I needed. They told me the dinner menus were half size bigger. I was just in love. Lmao I place I can eat like a King in vegas."
2766,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My first time at this location - the last one I went to in Vegas i think was on Sahara.

We strolled in on a hungover Sunday morning/afternoon and had about an hour wait. When we were seated our waiter warned us that everything is made fresh to it may take a while to get teh food out - but to our surprise it didn't take long at all.

Half of the group I ate with had never been to Hash House so wasn't sure what to expect. Their food is farm to table fresh and the portions are massive. I ordered the breakfast quesadilla in hopes of soaking up all the leftover alcohol in my stomach and I definitely ate it for at least 3 meals - it was massive, spicy and tasty!

Everyone ordered something different, fresh the chicken and waffles to pancakes and eggs and everyone was happy with what they ordered!"
2767,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hard to find the mystery elevator but once I got to the ""correct"" 2nd floor it was totally worth it! I sat at the bar and the woman best to me ordered a banana pancake. It came out and it was the size of her head. She asked for an extra plate and she cut off a chunk to share with me. The pancake was amazing. 

Then my order came and at first it looked like too much was going on, but the chicken and all the other flavors blended together perfectly. Huge portions,  very tasty and totally on point!"
2768,Hash House A Go Go,5,"From the Bloody Mary to the Fried Green tomatoes to the Chicken Fried Steak, they were all amazing, so good"
2769,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Okay so we have one of these back in Orlando, and we've always been curious about it and have heard awesome things from friends.. but we hadn't had the chance to visit! While visiting Las Vegas we saw a hash a go go and figured we'd try it out! As busy this place was we only had to wait about 10 minutes. We sat down and we were  greeted right away by our server Damon, because it was our first time he was very informative and helpful with the menu to help us select the most popular items on the menu! I started off with a caramel macchiato .. normally when I order coffee at restaurants I'm never pleased but there caramel macchiato was SO TASTY! my boyfriend ordered the man Vs food entree!! It was huuuuge, he enjoyed it very much. I ordered the tractor breakfast which was also very good. The prices are fairly priced and you get a huge portion! Thanks hash a go go we will be visiting in Orlando soon!"
2770,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The scene was a sunday morning breakfast. or was it a midday snack? Honestly in my obliterated state waltzing around indulged in my liquid heaven I was told, ""We must eat here.""

We arrive and play a few hands at the Casino Below I'm at this point out starting to grow hungry. The attentive casino bartender delivers our first drinks. My drear friend walks up stairs to put our names on the list as we are nicely handed a pager. Pagers are a genius invention by the way. The moment they buzz your face lights up not knowing what is about to happen.

The service was perfection. A tad of the ol' hard rock and roll meets the occasional drunk but he was patient. Gave a little sass but wasn't a complete asshole to us. The food now that's an understatement. If you come here and order for one, chances are you've ordered for a table of friends. While my company finished their plates, I couldn't even stomach my entire plate or drink.... 

Rolling out with a full belly and even more grateful buzz. Yes, I will be back."
2771,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House Go Go is a place I really like. I came here for a place to eat since my family did not know any other place. We ended coming here twice out of the three days we where here. The service is amazing, and even made a special drink for me."
2772,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Solid place, great food, great service. We arrived at 8:30 on a Wednesday morning and had a 10 minute wait. By the time our table was ready the lobby was filling up. Definitely get there early if you don't want to wait long!

The menu has a wide range of items. I got one of the farm scrambles (bacon, avocado, onion, and swiss). It came with a biscuit and potatoes. More than enough food. In fact, the portions here are insanely huge. One of my reasons for giving them four stars instead of five is because there is no need for portion sizes to be this large. It's pretty, and impressive, but ultimately it's just a waster of food. Most people leave a good amount behind.

The other reason for giving them four stars is that the potatoes were not that great. They were not terrible but not worth any room in my stomach. I focused on my biscuit (excellent!) and scramble.

My brother had the chicken and waffles. It was insane! Two pieces of fried chicken and four or more waffles. The waffles had strips of bacon inside them. We thought the added bacon in the waffles was fun, but again, an unnecessary amount of food that went to waste. Cut the chicken and waffles down to half the size and probably most people still couldn't eat it all.

Our server was fantastic - some of the best service we had in all of Vegas (shout out to Billy). The host was not super friendly and barely made eye contact, but he was efficient. 

I do recommend going for breakfast. Price is very reasonable and food is delicious. It's prepared to order so expect to hang out a bit as they cook it. Well worth it!"
2773,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Mixed review, as my personal experience was somewhat different from the rest of the members of my party. It was an hour and a half wait for a table, as pretty much everyone else on Yelp has mentioned, but we accepted that and went downstairs to gamble and peruse the shops. Once we were seated and eventually ordered, there was an hour and fifteen minute wait for our food to arrive. The waiter was a nice enough fellow, but perhaps overworked because once he performed a duty (taking our order, bringing ice water, delivering the food), he would disappear and we wouldn't see him for quite some time. On three separate times, we had to ask other waiters who just happened to be passing by to bring us something. My wife and I played it smart and ordered the chicken and waffles, thinking there's no way to screw that up. Right! We were happy with our meal, even sharing it between the two of us there was quite a bit leftover. The happy lad at the end of the table who ordered biscuits and gravy was equally satisfied. Then things got interesting: the lady to my left had a scramble with fairly raw, runny eggs, her husband had oatmeal with overripe fruit and no spoon to eat it with (and, of course, we couldn't find our waiter), and another young lady who ordered bread pudding found out too late that the bread pudding at Hash House A-Go-Go is Snicker's Bread Pudding, and had the consistency of a fairly large brick of fudge brownie. She had the lady balls to complain, and the waiter was willing to take it off the bill. If this review were based simply on my experience alone, I would say 4 stars."
2774,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Was in search for a place for breakfast on a Saturday morning and found this place while searching online. It was a little hard to find because it's inside The Linq and we weren't exactly sure where to go. 

Once we found the place, we learned there was a 15 min wait.....at 6am on a Saturday morning. Seemed strange because the place was more than half empty. We were told that they didn't have a lot of servers on. Waited and then got our table, dark decor inside and had a diner feel. Our server was great, she was really helpful and attentive. 

Very big portions so come hungry. The food was ok, nothing to rave about. It was a good place to try once, don't know if we would return."
2775,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is just... okay. Hence, the three star rating. First, the food comes in absolutely ridiculous portions, which are great for the price. However, you will come to realize that you probably won't even be able to eat half of your meal. I had the snickers flapjacks, which were good but soooo sweet, I had to order a side of bacon just to counteract the sweetness with some salt (I also love sweets, so it takes a lot for me to think something is TOO sweet). My boyfriend had the meatloaf hash, which we both thought was really delicious. We also ordered some speciality coffees, the smores mocha, and another mocha-type drink I can't remember the name of. Both were good, but didn't come out of the kitchen until we were almost done our meals. This brings me to the pretty bad service. Our waiter was nice, but he was soooo slow and maybe checked on us once the entire time we were there. Although - he did seem to be serving his other tables just fine. Overall, the food is okay/good and the service is blaaah."
2776,Hash House A Go Go,3,I'd give this place 4 stars albeit for the atmosphere.  A place that does such a good job with breakfast should be in a in a spot where their customers can look out a window.  Yikes.  Good food though!
2777,Hash House A Go Go,4,This is just a funky place for crazy breakfast combinations. Definitely more for a meat eater but there are still some fun egg and biscuits or other dishes for the non-chicken eater. It's upstairs from the casino and easy access for a break from the tables.
2778,Hash House A Go Go,5,Buttermilk biscuits are worth the trip
2779,Hash House A Go Go,5,"LOVE this place! The servers are so friendly and the food is great. We got the chicken and waffles, but their bloody Mary's are the best! We got married in the chapel at this hotel so we spent A LOT of time in this restaurant :)"
2780,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food. Huge portions. Didn't like how long it took to get our food and how we all to our food at different times.

You must try the kiwi watermelon lemonade! Delicious!"
2781,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hash House a Go Go, NO!
The wife had the Biscuits and Gravy, cold, sent it back for the basic breakfast, not much better.  I had the Bacon Waffle, cold as well but edible.  Server took for ever, saw her a few times.  When time to pay the bill it took another 15min after we gave her the payment to bring the receipt.  I don't know if they were just having a bad day but I cant see going back."
2782,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The sage chicken and waffle is to die for! Come hungry, roll out full. Great serve and food."
2783,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go is a definite MUST if you're staying in Vegas!  I was more than in love with everything on the menu, which made it REALLY hard to choose!  Luckily I came with 2 others so I could try bites of theirs as well, haha.

The menu has a really good selection.  I chose the Fried Salmon, my husband had the Fried Chicken Benedict, and our friend had the Kokomo (an extremely tempting meatloaf sandwich).  The food didn't really take that long, and they were a little busy considering how late it was.  I'm glad I chose the IP for my friend's stay.  When I saw the Hash House A Go Go sign, my Man v. Food lust pounced on it.  (P.S. - Adam Richman had the Fried Chicken Benedict, which that and my encouragement led my husband to try it.)  

All of the food came garnished beautifully and tasted even better than it looked.  I still have leftovers in my fridge two days later!  

If I don't go back to try one of their stuffed burgers before we leave Vegas, I might cry!"
2784,Hash House A Go Go,4,"As everyone knows, so much food! The chicken waffles are delicious. Definitely recommend sharing an entree here, still plenty of food for 2 people."
2785,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is amazing, it is a busy location in the LINQ, so arrive early or prepare to wait for seating. This would have been a 5 star if the waitstaff wasn't stretched so thin, and they didn't do the typical Las Vegas nickel and dime that we have all come to hate. You have to pay for a refill on a 6 oz chocolate milk for a kid, I didn't receive a refill on my soda, and there were times my lady was searching around for a waiter to refill her coffee. Atmosphere is great, food was incredible, and the price is decent as well. Chicken Benedict is awesome, as was the chicken fried steak!"
2786,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Great brunch place. Shared the Fried Chicken Benedict with the hubby and it was filling! Despite having a lot of ingredients, the taste fell pretty flat in my opinion. I was also pretty sad at the amount of fried chicken - I must have only gotten chicken in 25% of my bites. 

If I ever came back though, I would definitely try their corned beef hash - it looked so good!

We came on a Monday morning around 8:30a, so we beat the crowds, but it was still a 10 minute wait. When you are walking to Hash House AVOID THE WYNDAM TIMESHARE people - they tricked me into asking us if we needed help looking for anything and they tried to sell me timeshares. 

Would come back and try their other foods. Just not the fried chicken benedict."
2787,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Remember hearing the name of the restaurant and decided to check it out. There was no line and we went right in. Our server was super friendly, not overly friendly but truly genuinely nice. We didn't know what we were going to get ourselves into. The plates were huge!!! Luckily I decided to share with my husband. Definitely worth the price on the strip."
2788,Hash House A Go Go,4,This was a great spot for a late night meal. The portions were huge & I mean HUGE. We had a party of five but only ordered two entrees. We actually devoured one plate but we were left with leftovers for the second plate. Our servers were very nice as well. The environment itself was amusing. I was very satisfied for my first time being here.
2789,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love breakfast so naturally I figured there had to be a ton of amazing breakfast places on the Strip, right? Well if there is,  I couldn't find them! but i did stumble upon this gem and boy am I glad I did! Can I please bring you back to Pittsburgh? 

It was a little hard to find but only because of construction going on. The place is upstairs and has a really neat and interesting interior. We were seqted (both times we went) within 15 minutes! 

Both times I ordered the tractor driver breakfast which I got with eggs, a waffle, potatoes, and I got an extra side of sausage. This meal was huge and so filling! It also came out so fast I was shocked! Everything was cooked perfect and I highly recommend the sausage.  It basically melts in your mouth, so delicious! 

My boyfriend got the smashed pork tenderloin. OMG this was HUGE. it came out and the gentleman at the table next to ours asked to take a pic! I don't think I have ever seen a breakfast so big. My boyfriend loved it! 

Our entire experience both times was amazing. I told everyone that I knew in Vegas(we were there for a wedding) about it and most of them tried it and loved it. I am so happy I found this place and when Vegas calls again, you can find me there!"
2790,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Can't wait to come back here and get the same damn thing! I got the blueberry pancake. X-L PORTIONS PEOPLE. Easily can be shared, but why would you? The price is normal for vegas, but the portions are out of this world. Maybe Andre the Giant or Shaq would think this is a normal size plate. Delicious if I didn't mention.

We went at an off time, early around 8 AM, when everyone is still going to bed or passed the F out. So the service was good and quick."
2791,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We've eaten here many times on our travels to Vegas.  This time was by far the worst.  Arrived at 9:30 on a Saturday morning & were quoted a wait of 45-60 min for a party of 4.  No worries - it was busy.  We put our name on the list & then proceeded to wait against the wall - no more than 5 feet from the host stand.

After about an hour we went to the host & asked for our status - both were quite rude & informed me that they're already called us & given the warning call - so we were out of luck.  there is no possible way I missed my name being called multiple times from less than 5 feet away.

Our food was average and both our food & drink orders had mistakes.  Overall a very disappointing experience. 


Not sure I'll be coming back.  Customer service is your job - do it correctly."
2792,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Been to Vegas twice, ate here both times. The brown sugar banana pancake is perfection. Tip: their portions are huge so if you are staying at a hotel with no fridge for your leftovers, I suggest sharing!"
2793,Hash House A Go Go,5,I love this place! They have a wide selection of interesting food and they all come in large portions. My favorite is the giant pizza size pancake with banana and cinnamon. I wish they would open one in Austin!
2794,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this and would have more if it wasn't such a goddam zoo inside.
The wait is long and slightly chaotic but hey you can still get some drinks while you wait which I find super awesome.  That said the bloody Mary's were great! Spicy though so keep that in mind.

I got the corned beef hash and loved it- a lot of tender corned beef with perfect amount of cheese. Boyf got the fried chicken with maple and mashed potatoes- really tasty! Observing other diners though, next time I defs gots to get a Benedict. They are massive and topped with creamy looking goodness.

And our waitress was such a sweetheart and managed expectations upfront by letting us know how long the food would take (40 min).

All in all, if you have the the time (wait to seat, wait to get served) and the appetite this is a great spot. Will def come back next time I'm in LV."
2795,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Well you can feel yourself going into cardiac arrest when you visit the Hash House and it is well worth it. I was very excited to come here after seeing it featured on MvF, and the fact that we stayed right next door at Harrah's was a plus. 

This is hands down the fattest place you will ever go. Hash House specializes in what  they call ""twisted farm food."" I recall getting maple chicken and waffles which was very delicious. I say recall because I think my blood sugar may have spiked dramatically and I may have passed out for a few minutes. I awoke with a wicked Hash House hangover. I said I was done, but I was back two mornings later for breakfast. I got the french toast. It was delicious, but I barely put a dent in it.  

So why four out of five stars? While this is an impressive restaurant with impressive portions and quality, there is a lack of good service. I found both of my servers to be a bit on the slow side and in not the greatest of moods. If you can get past that, you will enjoy yourself, just make sure you call for an ambulance in advance."
2796,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome place to eat, I warn you ... you have to go on an empty stomach, the portions are huge"
2797,Hash House A Go Go,4,First tip.  Sit at the bar it's not worth an hour wait if there are just 2 of you!  The bar tender is quick to the point and makes the experience great!  The portions are ginormous!  We thankfully just ordered one item.  The sage fried chicken Benedict.  It's a total twisted giant plate of food.  My only complaint is it's served with scrambled eggs.  A runny poached egg would've sent me into a food coma :) the ambience is weird but food is fun!
2798,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I really enjoyed this place. Came here twice in a week. The food is served in very generous portions. Each plate is enough for 2 so sharing is encouraged. I will say, when ordering a drink specify if you want the souvenir glass. My entire party of 11 was charged for souvenir glasses we didn't ask for it want. By the time I realized that's why my $10.99 drink was $18.99 I was already out the door. My friend got the $19.99 Long Island Iced Tea- it came in a wagon- and was charged $37.99. No one wanted all that! 
Now, the food and drinks were good so I'll go back but will definitely be mindful of the souvenir glasses. Not Cool guys."
2799,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Got the ""famous chicken and waffles"" disappointing. Waffles soggy, and chicken- ehh. Overall nothing special."
2800,Hash House A Go Go,3,If you stay in the Linq the Hash House for breakfast is a must. A bit of a wait average 20 minutes or so. But food is great. Chicken and waffles is no joke.
2801,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Servers are rude and slow and the food is okay but not seasoned or delicious. Food portions are large and that is the only plus for this restaurant. They charge extra for everything, if you want ranch dressing for your fries it is 1.29 for a side of ranch when you just paid 15.00 for a grilled cheese and fries. The hostess was rude, the waiter was rude. Every thing we asked was followed with a sarcastic response. After having a horrible experience the icing on the cake was that this was the only restaurant I have been to all week in Vegas that did not offer a military veteran discount."
2802,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing food. I ordered the French toast which came with bacon and eggs. It was absolutely delicious. I will for sure be going back during my next visit to Vegas.
2803,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went here on Sunday morning, Dec. 11th about 9am. We had about a five minute wait as it was really slow in Vegas this weekend. Normally I would expect to wait much longer at any restaurant or buffet on a Sunday for breakfast. 

We shared the corn-beef skillet, a side of bisquits and gravy, the pistachio mocha drink and the caramel all over everything drink. Our server/bartender/barista was Kye and she handles everything back there no problem. She was also quick to point out that we should save some bisquit for the home-made peach preserves. Guess they put something different out all the time. The food was great, the corned beef was incredible and we had absolutely no questions asked about sharing a meal. 

My experience was very good and I would definately recommend it AND go back for seconds."
2804,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I've been to the San Diego branch and couldn't stop raving about it.  So the girls and I were very excited when we found out there was one on the strip = perfect way to recover from all the partying over the weekend.
How wrong we were.

Incredibly long waits, even after we'd already been seated.  Waitress just seemed very harried with the crowd, so we were happy to chill, but really, 30min before we could even place our order was a bit much.

Finally received our food and it was mediocre.  We ordered the corned beef hash, chicken and waffles, and french toast with the bananas.  Of the 3, the french toast was the only one that was decent, though the SD version was better.  

Portions are definitely huge, so probably a good place to go when you're still buzzed (ie impaired taste buds) and have a serious appetite."
2805,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Read the reviews on here, sound like a good try for a late breakfast/early lunch.  Little did the know the portions were big enough to cover dinner too.
Downsides - Its in the Imperial, which is a little old, a little...well, some unpleasant order wafted through the air as I made my way to the Hash House.  The wait was long, but thats tto be expected at a good, affordable ( for the strip ) food.
Upside - Very friendly, if harried, service.  Very good presentation of enormous amounts of food.  And best of all, its yummy.  I had the Sage fried chicken bendedict.  Chipotle hollandaise  sauce.  Enormous homemade biscuit.  Tender, flavorful chicken, scrambled eggs, great bacon...really quality food.  Lots of it.  My advice - bring a friend or a wheelbarrow.  
If you have the time, highly recommended.  If you don't have the time, make the time."
2806,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Better put down your purse and start eating. The portions are huge. Huge. And delicious. 

If you haven't eaten here yet, you should, but do so with an open mind. It's twisted farm food. It sounds kinda off when you read the menu, but just trust em.

CHICKEN AND WAFFLES FTW!

I had the whatever adam richman had in mvf and it was delicious. I split it with a friend, and STILL couldn't finish it.

My husband had the pork tenderloin and it was amazing.

I recommend the BLT Bloody Mary.

Our service was excellent too. I did hear another lady complaining about the service they had the day before, but was thanking our server for being on top of it. It's a gamble when you eat on the strip in vegas..."
2807,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The portions are otherworldly: I'm sure, a reliable feature of this Indiana chain

We split a vegetarian hash dish, and still, left at least 1/5 of the dish alone.

Biscuit was yummy and so was the peach compote. 

Frozen square potatoes!!! No bueno.. no sirree.

Eggs were soft scrambled but we wanted even softer ( a la Eggslut!!). All the same, happy with being full after staying up all night in bed, taking and laughing ( and annoying the neighbor )

Fuels one up!! Bathrooms are downstairs and to the right!"
2808,Hash House A Go Go,5,"had the benedict and it was amazing.  can't wait to go back and try the steak or the crab cakes.

this one was phenomenal.  not all hash houses are the same."
2809,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Travel to Vegas on the regular, 45+ days in 2015.  Hash House is a go-to spot every time I'm in town. Andy's Sage Benedict is OFF THE HOOK, but be careful as your great meal can easily turn into a food coma and cut your day short. 

Andy's Sage Benedict Tips: Don't eat the pre-meal biscuit, easy on the drinks, order the meal without the biscuit under the mash potatoes.  Once the meal comes, focus on highest taste items first, chicken, veggies, eggs, sauce and so on.  If you can clear most of the plate and only have a pile of mashies left behind . . .  YOUR A BOSS!   

Do time your meal accordingly, if you cruise there after 9a expect to spend a LONG TIME in line. I have been to the HHaGG's at Linq, Rio and across town and personally enjoy the ""off strip"" locations way more."
2810,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is a must try. I came in during breakfast and there was a wait. 20 minutes.
Their servings are big, so I do suggest you share with someone. My bf and I shared the rosemary chicken waffle thing, and the friend chicken was so good. Best fried chicken I have ever had. MUST MUST MUST TRY!
The service and staff was great, very friendly. It does get loud and very busy though."
2811,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was located in the heart of Vegas on the strip. Easy to find and get to. Away from the casinos so it makes you feel like you are not in a mall but in a separate dining experience. 
What I love is that they are always open and always serving breakfast foods. The menu was not too long but not too small. It has brunch and dinner options and a page for drinks. They were selling merch too which made it feel like a destination location and less like a dining experience. The prices where on the upper end of average, but for the portion amount it felt very fair.
It took about 40 minutes to get seated and after that service took a while, but the bar was open and the bartenders were very friendly. During service our glasses stayed full and we were checked up on. 
Atmospherically, the place was very American diner styled.
The food was plated in an adventurous messy fashion. It tasted ok, I feel like there could have been more flavor in my potatoes, but overall it was good."
2812,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best breakfast ever! I had the tractor driver combo with a blueberry pancake and it was amazing! The pancakes are HUGE so just keep that in mind.
2813,Hash House A Go Go,5,Gotta be one of best brunches I've ever had. Of course I went with the Chicken & Waffles and it definitely did not disappoint. They give you so much food that I stuff myself and still had half of my meal left! I'd heard about this place from others and it definitely lived up to the hype.
2814,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Be prepared for a long wait unless you stalk people at the bar, which we did and waited less than 5 minutes. The service was wonderful, and even though the bartender was swamped he was attentive and nice. They were very knowledgable about food prep since I have a gluten allergy. My husband had the chorizo hash- spicy (and I love spicy), delicious, and a great portion. I had the eggs Benedict with the roasted red pepper sauce- I added hot sauce, so flavorful, enough for 2 people. The person next to me had a pancake that looked great- no exaggeration it was about 1 foot in diameter. Fresh squeezed oj was yummy and coffee was good (with free refills)."
2815,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Every time I visit Las Vegas I always make sure to make a special trip here. Absolutely love this place. This is great for the person who loves breakfast food no matter what time of a day it is. The Corn Beef and Hash is my all time favorite. They give you a large portion of corn beef with potatoes two eggs (style of your choosing) and a biscuit. The corn beef is never extremely greasy the way a lot of other places make theirs. It's always delicious.  

Another one of my favorites is the banana pancake. It's a giant pancake with bananas cooked into it as a posed to just sitting on top. Also very delicious and a great size for sharing. 

My only negative is that during some parts of the day there is a long wait and the last time I went two employees were arguing in from of the hostess station (a little unprofessional). But these has never stopped me from going. I would suggest going very early in the morning or late at night for their late night menu. 

I always have a positive experience when coming here. Highly recommend this place!!!"
2816,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Made reservations two weeks ago but when we got there they said they don't take open table reservations until after 2 but there was nothing on the website or the confirmation email I got from booking it. I was a little annoyed but none the less we put in our names and waited 10-15 minutes which wasn't bad for a Monday morning. Our server was fantastic, unfortunately I don't recall his name but he was quick and friendly and made our experience that much better. I will definitely be recommending this to my all my friends and family!"
2817,Hash House A Go Go,5,Me and Family visited here during memorial day week. Oh wow so much food and flavorful! The service was impeccable! We all enjoyed our meals very much. They are a must on my list my next trip to Vegas!
2818,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was so excited to be in Vegas and to be trying this place. I had wanted to eat here for a very long time! I think the hype may have been too much though. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. The waitress was very friendly. The food looked good. I ordered pancakes and my husband got the sage chicken with biscuits. The kids got fruit and pancakes. While it looked nice, it didn't taste as good as I would have expected. My pancake was rather chewy and my husband's sage chicken had no flavor. We were probably better off at a casino buffet."
2819,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Okay so unpopular opinion, but I didn't really like it here. The food was decent and it wasn't bad at all, but when i think of hash i think of HASHED potatoes. I got one of the hash options, some mushroom/spinach/onion thing - there was also an option for corn beef hash plus more. Not sure if this was the NJ part of me, the rest of it was cut up and it looked fine BUT the potatoes were plain and were basic breakfast potatoes. The biscuits was good! Just wasnt as impressed with the actual food."
2820,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My husband wants to try this place he thought will be a good place to have our breakfast.  Nothing so special about it this place except for the big portion. There chicken with waffles, so dry!!!"
2821,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I wish I could put 10 stars on this place!

It's amazing. 

The wait time to eat here is not long at all considering how popular it is! My cousin came and we waited for about 15 minutes before being seated. 

We came during brunch, so we still had breakfast cravings. I ordered the pancakes with potatoes and eggs and OMG! I was in Heaven and you for sure get what you pay for. 

Before receiving my food, my cousin and I kept gazing at all the large portions of food put on one person's order. The presentation was fantastic and it even made us hungrier watching people eat with such satisfaction! We waited about 20 minutes for our food not bad. 

My pancake was huge! the buttermilk once was yummy and it wasn't too thick. I didn't finish it, but I did finish my scrambled eggs and crispy potatoes! Those were nicely seasoned and made. Enjoyed them as the side to my pancake!

The restaurant brings a lot of great energy, but my waitress was not, She was a little grumpy and it seemed as though she did not enjoy her job one bit. She tried correcting us, when really, she was the one who made a mistake. I felt she just had a snobby attitude. If we had a better server then there really would be no downfalls to this place! 

Other than her, the rest of the customer service was great from the host to the guys from the kitchen to another waitress who was very kind to us. 

I am absolutely coming back for more next time I am in Vegas. Please make sure to get a good workout in before coming here! Food Coma is a given"
2822,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yum yum I miss it already!  

After seeing this place on Man v. Food I had to go and was disappointed when we called and found out that it was about 20 minutes off strip...BUT WAIT!  Before I could hang up, she mentioned the NEW location INSIDE the Imperial Palace...yay!  

I loved the food, the service, and yes, there's a wait...because they make everything fresh and to order.  Amazing biscuits and hash, delicious chicken n waffles, & giant Bloody Mary's.  

Shout out to my boy Wesley...the host...he was such cool people. I will be back...mark my words lol."
2823,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Extremely long wait, super slow service once seated, and absolutely ridiculously huge portions. Every plate that went by had tons of food left on it. I understand wanting to get a lot of your money and wanting to be famous for large portions, but this is just wasteful. The food was only OK, nothing impressive flavor wise. I would recommend somewhere else!"
2824,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is amazing! Come here hungry because the portions here are huge! I shared the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict and the Salmon & Asparagus Eggs benedict. The Fried chicken one is simply great and is a must try if you can't decide what to order. They fry up a chicken breast which is crunchy on the outside but still tender and moist on the inside. The Salmon comes with flaky salmon and grilled asparagus and is served with a killer chipotle cream sauce. I came here hungry and I finished everything, but these portion sizes are enough to fill you for a whole day. I had this on my last day in Vegas and it was simply the best way to end my trip."
2825,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They told us the wait would be 45min to am hour.  We went downstairs to use our phones.  There is absolutely no reception in there, their only major con. Would be nice if they had free wifi.  It is difficult to have people meet you for breakfast when they can't get a hold of you.  They also do not let you use their phone. We came up after 30min and our name had actually been called 5min prior.  We waited 2 more minutes and got sat at a nice booth. Our server Jason was amazing.  He was very happy which made my mood better. He suggested a wonderful mimosa. Fresh squeezed orange juice.  It was very fresh and a good sweet.  She ordered the tractor combo with a vanilla waffle. They gave her potatoes instead of bacon.  They brought out her bacon quickly and she got to keep the potatoes too.  She said it was the best waffle she ever had!   I ordered the French toast.  The banana and pecans come together with the French toast so well. The toast is very thick. Felt like I had close to a loaf of bread on my plate haha.  Love the portions here $12.95 for each of our plates.  This restaurant is always consistent.  My favorite breakfast in Las Vegas."
2826,Hash House A Go Go,3,This place is all hype. I liked that 3 people can eat from one plate but the taste itself was not that great! We went in at 9am on a Saturday morning and it was great because our group didn't really wait. If I went again I'd try something from the dinner menu.
2827,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had the Andy's sage fried chicken and my husband had the chicken asparagus and onion hash !!! OMG those two were just out of the world... I mean the best hash or fried chicken you can ever taste. Their portion are too big for a petite like me although my husband was able to finish his portion. 

Its like food at its best. A must visit for anyone for their Las Vegas trip. If you call yourself a foodie. It was just awesome!!!!!"
2828,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I wish I found this place my first day out in Vegas because I would've ate here every day.   I was staying at the MGM which didn't have to many breakfast spots near it except for Denny's and the buffet. I then searched on Yelp for other breakfast spots in walking distance because I was tired of eating at the buffet for breakfast.  I then came across Hash House a Go Go on Yelps search results.  When I saw the name it made me think.... wait I've heard of this place before.  The reviews for this place were amazing and I did a little research to check and see where/how I might have heard of this place.  I then came across a food blog that mentioned them being featured on Food Networks show Diners Drive-ins & Dives.  That's when I remembered where I had seen this place before.  We then took a looooooonnnnnnnnnng walk down Las Vegas blvd to the Quad hotel so that I could indulge in the goodness I remember seeing on Food Network and also the pics that were uploaded to Yelp.  When we arrived the wait didn't take that long due to it being only two of us.  I'm sure if it was 3 or more we would've had a much longer wait.  After quickly skimming through the menu I instantly knew what I wanted to order.  I asked the waiter what he would recommend and he stated that everyone comes in for the Andy's Sage Fried chicken.  We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried chicken and the corned beef house hash.  When the orders arrived I couldn't believe the amount of food they give you for the price.  I mean this was like a mountain of food for two.  My order arrived in a cast iron skillet with eggs on the bottom piled with potato hash and the house made corned beef and Swiss cheese on top with a homemade biscuit.  I then took a bite of my corned beef with Swiss cheese and man o man.  That was some of the best corned beef I've had in a long time. Everything was well seasoned and fresh straight from the farm I'll like to add. I didn't get a chance to taste the Sage fried chicken but it looked amazing. I honestly couldn't eat my entire meal.  Might I add the prices were not crazy either.  My meal was $12 and the Sage fried chicken meal was $15. After leaving I wanted to kick myself in the a$$ for not coming here earlier during my stay. I could have ate here every morning for half the price of a buffet while leaving stuffed like I ate at a buffet.  This is a perfect example of ""if you knew better you'll do better"".  I will be back again Vegas and when I return I will be eating breakfast, lunch, dinner at HHGG."
2829,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Vegas places tend to be overpriced for mediocre food.  But, do not fret.  Your problems are over!  
The Hash House a Go Go should be your go-to place, at least for breakfast.  They also serve dinner and lunch as they are open 24 hours a day.  The best time to come for breakfast is between 7:30am- 8:30am.  After that you will wait between 30-60 minutes for a table.  
You can have a simple breakfast for 9.99 which includes two eggs, bacon or another meat choice, delicious chunky potatoes (they call them hash but it's not a hash), a biscuit or toast with homemade strawberry jam.  It is so large that I couldn't eat all of it.  The other dishes on the menu are so large that when other people got their food I went around taking photos of their food like a roving photographer.  Some people wanted me to have some of their food, LOL.  Just wanted the pictures!   So when you see all these photos, I don't want you to think that I ordered every one of these dishes.  But take a look and see if you agree that this is the place to go for breakfast in Vegas.  They have three spots in various hotels.  BTW, I hear their chicken and waffles is to die for and that certainly qualifies as a great dinner option.  
Enjoy! Enjoy!"
2830,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Wove through the maze of the hotel to find this location, which wasn't particularly easy. It was totally freezing inside, which i'm sure during the worst part of the day is great, but at 8am, it was a little much. 

We were seated and had coffee quickly. Food came out superfast, was fresh and, obviously, plentiful. I ate about a quarter of the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, fed some to my fellow diners, and took even more back to our hotel for others. The chicken and biscuit were moist and flavorful, the bacon was crispy and plentiful, and the potatoes were great. I pushed aside most of the sauce on top and just went for the chicken -- sauce on the side would've probably helped control the balance better.

 I cannot imagine anyone eating this whole crazy thing. I wish there was a tasting portion so that you could just have three perfect bites, as I think that that would be more satisfying and in line with how I like to eat, but I totally get that that's not the idea here.

So, bring your friends (or let them sleep in and bring them leftovers), and come early, and it seems like the worries about sogginess, slowness, etc., aren't an issue. But bring a sweatshirt. Brr."
2831,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was disappointed overall, especially given the rave reviews. Maybe we just came on a bad night.

Pros
-Staff was nice
-Beautiful, fantastic presentation of food
-Freshly squeezed tangerine juice  and lemonade good

Cons
-I got crab cakes, and there wasn't enough crab in it. It was mostly bread. Even though it was savory, there was no crab or seafood taste at all, and no chunks of crab at all. Disappointing for its steeper price of 24.99.
-My husband got the chicken and waffles. The skin was crispy and the food beautifully plated. However, it was very bland. The syrup was not sweet enough, the chicken not flavorful, nor the waffle exceptionally freshly warm or tasty or freshly slightly crispy on outside. It was cold and very ordinary tasting. In chicken and waffles, not all 3 elements can be bland and ordinary. One must be more stronger or flavorful, either a sweeter syrup, or a well flavored and marinated chicken, or a great waffle. It is possible for the other 2 elements to be ordinary if one element is done well. It was bland. To top it off, the chicken still had its bone. I usually don't mind, but on top of everything, another minus. 

Overall, a disappointment, especially when the final bill for 2 of us came out to $69 for beautiful, but bland and ordinary tasting food."
2832,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I came here with a couple friends for dinner on our last night in Vegas. I was honestly kind of underwhelmed. I had the fried chicken salad, because while I wanted something a little lighter, I also wanted to try that chicken!

The portions were huge--I don't think I saw anything come out of the kitchen that didn't look enormous. The salad was pretty good, good balance of dressing. But...the chicken was so overdone! It was dry and stringy and almost entirely inedible. I was so disappointed. It was breast meat, which is very easy to overcook, but come on--you're known for your fried chicken, get it together! To be fair, my friend who also had the chicken in her entree thought it was fine, so maybe it was just mine. Adding to all this, I had asked for red onions to be added, and they came in a little condiment cup rather than incorporated into the salad, and it was a 95 cent upcharge. What the hell. I would have been less disgruntled by the upcharge if it had actually been in the salad rather than served on the side like that. I've been to restaurants where they do absolutely no modifications and it's fine, I just need to know, but if you do and I ask for something to be added, please either actually add it to the dish or let me know it will be on the side! (Is this overly high maintenance of me? Oh well...)

Other thoughts: I thought the emphasis on presentation was a little overdone. Not everything needs rosemary sprigs and half an apple as a base for a knife stuck into the dish. It seems like the theme was sort of like a ""bigger is better"" idea. But--the complimentary honey-glazed biscuits were delicious! It wasn't an awful experience, but I was overall disappointed. I think the chicken being overdone really was the tipping point."
2833,Hash House A Go Go,4,Bloody Mary's are really really good. I had the corned beef hash. I would probably get the chorizo one. That one was better because of the chorizo flavoring! Bacon waffle is awesome.
2834,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I think the food is ave, i dont recommend getting the fried chicken with any kind of sauce cause it will be soggy, the waitress gave me the wrong drink.. more for the vegas for atmosphere then food or service"
2835,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Meh. Service is good, but food is just okay. The only reason to go here is because you are incredibly hungry and you need over 2000 calories immediately. I think there are a lot of better breakfast joints in Vegas."
2836,Hash House A Go Go,1,The food was extremely greasy. My portobello mushroom cap sandwich was basically just greasy spinach lettuce with the tiniest mushroom I've ever seen. When I complained to the waiter he said he'd bring me another but never did and then basically avoided us for the rest of the evening. We only saw him again when he brought our check. Will not be returning!
2837,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the obvious place to visit while in Vegas! It's got great food, portion sizes are huge, and it's always open!

It is quite pricey though, just a heads up!"
2838,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Service is good, but food is bad. They put fried eggs on eggs benedict (wtf?), sauce on crab eggs benedict is garlic heavy (wtf wtf?), the asparagus which should be a healthy part tasted like ot was encased in butter (gross), and then the whole thing was padded out with what tasted like yesterday's mashed potatoes and a big stale flavorless biscuit. Just so bad. Ordered a double cappuccino and it tasted fune but so tiny. Lots of other good breakfast places on the strip, avoid this one!"
2839,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh my god!  This place should be outlawed because of the scrumptious food and the unbelievably large servings!  But please don't tell anyone, because I want to go back for more!  Chicken and waffles (had it twice while in Vegas from 1/8-16/11), was some of the best food I've ever eaten.  Too bad I could only handle eating one piece of chicken and one bacon-stuffed waffle each time.  The BLT Bloody Mary was the absolute best!  We went late on a weeknight and walked right in.  Went at 10:30 on a Saturday morning and waited almost an hour--worth the wait!  Everything our group had was fantastic--don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.   Note: The Snicker flap jack sounds too decadent to eat--it is!--but eat it anyway!!!  Enjoy!"
2840,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Sage Fried Chicken was massage. 4 waffles and 2 Fried Chicken breasts stacked on top of each other. Sounds weird but it was delicious! Huge portion sizes but a bit pricey. But then again, you get your monies worth and you're in Vegas."
2841,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place probably has the biggest entrees I've ever seen. Food and service is ok, same with decor. Good for brunch and breakfast"
2842,Hash House A Go Go,3,Local hotspot away from the strip. Huge portions and friendly staff.
2843,Hash House A Go Go,5,I don't know what I can say that all the other thousands of reviewers haven't 'said already... This will be the place I will always come back to  when I'm in Vegas ! Bottom line his place is really special!
2844,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Too much food. I know that's their thing, but it was food on top of food for the sake of lots of food. Quantity over quality, though the quality wasn't bad. Had one of the Benedicts. It really didn't need to be on top of mashed potatoes. Many of the dishes were a sight to see when they were being served.  Never seen so many people waiting to get a table in my life. Probably waited close to an hour to get seated. OJ tasted like Tang."
2845,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The place for hungry people. Food was OK, not specifically decent or delicious though. It was A LOT of food so if you order two plate for two people, you might not able to finish it."
2846,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I had High Hopes as I read they had large portions and lots of good reviews. I ordered steak and eggs, the eggs were delicious but the steak was inedible, unchewable because of the texture. They ordered me a new steak and the steak was delicious. The house potatoes that came with my steak had kind of a weird taste, so they ordered fried potatoes and they were not very good either. The plate came with a biscuit and it was unchewable, with little flavor, so they brought me toast. They had no Jam in a flavor that I liked. Imagine only one flavor of jam, strawberry.

I think they're trying to overdo simple items. To be honest with you, the overall flavor was not very good. I probably wouldn't eat there again.

The server was a real nice guy, the manager was very accommodating as well. I think maybe the flavors they have are just not the flavors that I'm used to."
2847,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I have been here 4 times. It is on top of my list of restaurants to visit whenever I visit Vegas. There is always a line, so expect to wait, but it is completely worth it! The service is great. They have a super friendly waitstaff who are really knowledgable about their menu and drinks. Every time I've been, I've only gotten breakfast, so I have no idea how their lunch or dinner is. Their food has huge portions, but every bite is delicious. I've had their pancakes, chicken and waffles, hash, eggs Benedict, and sampled many other dishes that the people I came with ordered. Everything was delicious. If you've never been, this is definitely one of the places you need to go! You won't regret it!"
2848,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Large portions, but food tastes average.

We had the chorizo hash and andy's sage fried chicken benedict. fresh apple juice and a mint coffee drink. 

the andy's sage fried chicken benedict taste pretty good for the first few bites, then it just became a little boring. didnt like the chorizo hash much."
2849,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was very yummy and portions are more than you can eat lol staff was very pleasant and professional. Would definitely recommend this place and will visit again when in town.
2850,Hash House A Go Go,5,The atmosphere was fun and carefree. The food was delicious and the portions were big enough to feed two people. The Bloody Mary's weren't the best on the strip but I still enjoyed two of them.
2851,Hash House A Go Go,1,My wife and I just finished checking in to the Linq Hotel and we saw this place...food was good not bad but the server just gave us a bad taste..we were ask to PAY for our food as soon as we got our food.. no joke..He did NOT set the bill on the side of our table and walked away..he straight ask me to pay for the bill.. I asked him if he was done with his shift or something he said no but if I could pay the bill now...very unprofessional!!!
2852,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Prepare to wait a life time. It was a two hour wait. 1 hour to be seated and 1 hour to get our food. Bc of how packed it was we were expecting some kind of over the top Breakfast. But reality hit quick, breakfast was ordinary nothing you can't find anywhere else. If you order eggs make sure they are COOKED. 3 of us had water down eggs, looked like powdered eggs. Not ""fresh"" at all, like the waitress explained. Anyway.. To not worth the wait."
2853,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So this restaurant is busy so plan ahead to spend some time waiting before being seated. 

We started off with a Bloody Mary and mimosas and I loved the Bloody Mary, very well made, flavorful and average on the spicymess. Mother enjoyed her mimosa as well. 

As far as food, Dad got The Basic Two Eggs breakfast which was 2 eggs cooked to your liking and l, potatoes and choice of meat and he got bacon. He enjoyed his breakfast. 

Mother and I opted in for the hashes, she ordered the corned beef hash and I did the chorizo hash. I really enjoyed my hash, Mom however did not like the corned beef. Dad and I gave it a taste and we both loved the corned beef hash, but Mom simply didn't care for it. 

As far as service, the servers and seating hosted and buss staff are all very nice, welcoming and friendly. Our server was too, but I felt he was either slow or all over the place because I could see him come from the very far end of the restaurant. Food did take a while to get out which is understandable but drinks were going to tables seated after us and ours took a long time. Had to ask for waters where other tables I felt got water when they were seated, and when I asked for water i got only one, so I pointed out we needed three and that as well took a while. Other than that, we had a great experience and if in Vegas we'll definitely return."
2854,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It was ok.    The portions were huge, but it was typical breakfast food.   We had to wait for a long time before our drinks were refilled and our leftovers boxed up.    In fairness, I think they over booked server.    She was trying to take care of about 5-7 tables all at once.    She tried her best, perhaps management needs to hire more people or schedule them accordingly."
2855,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Famous for its Man vs. Food choices just know that you are the man and the food WILL win. 

I really enjoyed their tangerine mimosa and watching my friends attempt to eat their food. Wasn't impressed by the salmon and pesto scramble but was a weird choice to begin with. 

Regardless it's a Vegas experience one must participate in! Just... Look up your meal before you order. Seriously."
2856,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So sorry for the late review, but this place was great!! I loved the food and the variety, too. Our waiter, Nick, was super nice and very, very helpful!!!!!!!!! Keep up the good work, ladies and gents!!!!!! :):):)"
2857,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Honestly, I have never seen such big portions.  It was actually gross!  The customers here tend to be on the large side.  The food is average to below average.  The drinks are strong.  I have to say I really enjoyed the waitstaff -- great people."
2858,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Well I really looked Forward to coming to this place. 
The wait was 15 min. The hosts were friendly and welcoming. The server did not  say his name. We ordered our food. The problem, it wasn't hot.I ordered chicken and waffles it was not hot!just a stage away from.being cold, very bland and mostly fried breading. The presentation is the only good part. We had to ask for refills on water, my husband's skillet wasn't hot omg.also waited forever for the server to pick up the check.  All in all I wont come back to this location. Chicken and waffles 17.50 smh."
2859,Hash House A Go Go,4,We went here for breakfast on a friend's recommendation and were not disappointed . The server told us the portions were big and maybe we should share but me and my boyfriend have very different tastes in food so we each got our own meal. I got the Salmon Benedict  and he got the Bacon Waffles the waitress said the salmon dish was going to be spicy but I think she was thinking about normal people not used to spice. I love spicy Thai food and the salmon dish was just right for me it tasted awesome. She was right about the portion sizes though we each ate half and took the rest back to our hotel.
2860,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So I succumbed to the sage chicken benedict.  Served with a spear of rosemary and the knife OJ was missing down the middle.  Not a lot of comments here other than to say this place has made huge portions and weird combinations a winner.  

BTW - The bloody mary was killer."
2861,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This was probably the worst meal I have had in the 14 years I've been coming to Las Vegas.  The service and beverage were awesome which is why I gave 2 stars rather than 1.

There were 4of us.  We were seated quickly around 7pm on a Thursday.  We ordered the fried green tomato starter along with crab cakes, meatloaf, and chicken penne pasta entrees.  The tomatoes were okay.  I understand that mass quantities of food is their ""thing"" but it was ridiculous.  All the entrees were bland.  The meatloaf was dry, potatoes, were mealy,  just really bad.  

I've read great things about this place but totally not my cup of tea..."
2862,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service is excellent. Bloody Mary's are exquisite! Food in general isn't bad. Portions are HUGE. BUT... the chicken and waffles... not so much. The chicken skin is always rubbery and not in a good way and the chicken is consistently beyond soggy. They need to cook the chicken longer or in hotter oil. The breaded tenderloin chicken sandwich, which is a Hoosier hallmark, is ALWAYS over cooked! It is thin. It doesn't need to be cooked to a burnt dry crisp. 

They have a truly great concept there!!! Just a little tweaking would go a looooooong way toward making them the great and amazing restaurant they could be!"
2863,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great Service Great Food Took My Mother In-Law Out To Breakfast and She Really Enjoyed it A Hour Wait but hey We Loved the Food and The Service
2864,Hash House A Go Go,5,Absolutely love this place! Food as big as my head and it tastes so so good! Thank you all so much for awesome service and great eats! Coming back asap!
2865,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Hash House A NO-NO
Wait, Wait, Wait for seat, food, even the bill.
I could not even eat my food because it was so mediocre and I'm in Vegas! Not worth the calories. Then the bill for this breakfast for two was $60. 
And I was excited to try the place.
Don't bother."
2866,Hash House A Go Go,5,Just finish having a wonderful breakfast with some friends and family. This was my first time coming here and I must say the place smells like food heaven I had some waffles with chicken that was to die for.  I definitely recommend trying.
2867,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Come here hungry!! They should have a message  stating pictures of food are smaller than what they really are. I feel like Texas has nothing on hash house!! They start you with the best honey melt in your mouth biscuits ... and this is the start of big. Let me tell you I should had known when under the menu item I order it said man vs food likes this... let me tell u it was good. But I'm the battle of lj vs food ... food won.. it started with mashed potatoes, biscuits, spinach , tomato, bacon, a huge piece of sage chicken , eggs, cheese and chipotle sauce."
2868,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very busy place.  Our waiter was okay but the woman waiting the tables nearby was doing a fantastic job.
The pancake was huge and tasted good but was a little dry.  Solution was more syrup.  My wife's waffles were cold.
Would give the restaurant another try.  Various items on the menu look very tempting.   The guy next to us got the chicken fried steak and it was huge.  I would love to try the chicken pot pie.   Oh well another time and a different location."
2869,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I was here on May 1, 2015.  We were seated in less than five minutes. It was 2 o'clock in the morning. This is a 24 hour restaurant inside the LINQ Hotel. 

Pros - we were seated in less than five minutes. The food was good. The is 24/7.

Cons - it took the waitress around 20 to 30 minutes before taking our orders. From the time our borders wouldn't take it to them at least one hour to serve our food. Once the food was served we asked for ranch dressing which never came to our table. We even asked another waiter for the ranch dressing and they said okay but it never came. The waitress never even came back to ask if everything was okay. We asked for our check over and over and over again but no one came to give it to us. We had to stand up and go to the person at the bar and request for our check because we were so tired and wanted to go to rest.

I went back to the LINQ Hotel this weekend may 15 to 17. I will never go back to this restaurant ever again."
2870,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Got defeated by the mountain of food at Hash House! Was recommended to go here from a friend who said ""portions are great for the price"" and ""Definitely come here!"" We here around 4pm with a group of four and wow, this place is amazing! We didn't think it would be that big of portions since its Vegas. So we each tried something different! The portions were huge, we couldn't even finish! Definitely some place you should go to when in Vegas!"
2871,Hash House A Go Go,2,There's just way too much going on in their dishes.  I ordered the waffles and chicken.  The Rosemary just overpowered the flavor of everything else and the teriyaki sauce did not belong on the plate.
2872,Hash House A Go Go,5,must go! bomb breakfast! huge portions! friend chicken was the bomb! still full!
2873,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I been there once, and my first and only impression was a good one.  The wait was about 15 - 20 mins, but it was worth it.  They give you a lot of food, and the presentation of what you've ordered is nice.  I ordered the chicken and waffles which was priced reasonably, and it was great!!! The chicken was nicely fried, and the waffles were nice and big.  I ended up eating like 3 pieces of chicken and 1 waffle.  So yea.. you're going to be leaving with a lot of food."
2874,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We arrived at around 10am on a Sunday morning...walked right in and we were seated immediately...just in time because a crowd started to form as we placing our order.  We had the chicken and waffles, banana pancakes and one of the girls ordered the eggs benedict (you couldn't tell what it was - i couldn't see the eggs because whatever was on top of it all was massive).  

The chicken had these spears of rosemary(?) on top or was it sage, I couldn't tell, really.  I thought the chicken was lacking some flavor and slightly leaning on the dry side.  The waffles were OK, but I did like the idea of having strips of bacon in the waffles...pour the syrup and it's all downhill from there.  Banana pancakes were not bad, but not great either.  It just seemed like a regular pancake mix with some bananas mixed in...not really impressed. My friend barely made a dent in the eggs benedict - way too much food.  She said it was OK and didn't rave the way she would had it been out of this world delish.

Our server was great (when he was around) and the wait for a our food was a little long...there was only 1 waffle maker working?  For the entire restaurant...what??  We weren't in a huge rush, but by the time we got our food, I was already dreaming of lunch.

I need to try this place in San Diego - is there a possibility that it could be better?"
2875,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is amazing! We went multiple times during our stay and I highly recommend. Go early or expect a wait.
2876,Hash House A Go Go,4,Make a RESERVATION!!!  Awesome breakfast but u need to share. Don't be a hero and try to the entrees urself. Very good food and awesome servers!
2877,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food is aces. Service could use some improvement.  It can't be subpar because of volume,  since there is a lot of support staff. Asking for silverware when your food arrives only to receive it many minutes later is unacceptable,  especially when you bring a group of people with you after tabbing 3 about their food. 
Come for the food.  Do not expect much from the service."
2878,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A lil on the pricey side, but what isn't in Vegas!! But honestly for the price u are getting quality food in large portions. Sage fried chicken with spinach is amazing, my gf had the mushroom hash with scrambled eggs.  Check it out!!"
2879,Hash House A Go Go,4,This was my first time at a Hash House and we had a great experience! Went with my boyfriend for my birthday brunch and loved it. He got the chicken and waffles and I got the fried chicken benedict (this was on Man vs Food... definitely insta worthy)! Portions are massive so make sure to come hungry. I barely even made a dent in mine and got another 2 meals out of it with my leftovers. Service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!
2880,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Think Man v. Food.

You heard?

The meals here are ginormous but then so is the bill. Most importantly, the food tasted great and will definitely fill you up. 

here's the plan
1. get in line and wait about 15-45 mins for your table.
2. do jumping jacks and sit ups while you wait
3. run in place
4. pushups
5. stretch abs
6. order and eat."
2881,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love love love this place. The portions here put the Gi on Ginormous and to top it off the food is excellent. You could literally eat here everyday and be happy !! 

The person to whom I will soon be related to by marriage is infatuated by the meatloaf . She literally could not get enough !! 

This place is a must go to Vegas establishment . Make sure to bring your appetite! The drinks are great also!"
2882,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is awesome! So great that we went back he next day for lunch. It does get crowded so be prepared to wait but it's worth it. Huge portions that are perfect to share. The best chicken and waffles I have ever had. The chicken is two big breasta of chicken over huge Belgium style waffles with amazing maple syrup. The best mom alcoholic drink is the watermelon kiwi lemonade. Wow!!!! Yum yummy
2883,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Let me just say that this place was amazing!!! It was crowded when we walked in but when we asked how long the wait was, they told us 10-15 minutes. Sure enough, we got seated in ten minutes. So don't walk away when you see the crowd! I ordered the bacon waffle, which was out of this world!! They place the bacon inside the waffle and it was delicious! Scrambled eggs with cheese, cooked perfectly! Bacon on the side which was nice and crispy. And coffee which was delicious! The portion size is super huge, so you can share if on a budget and you will be full! The staff were busy but very courteous and friendly! We never had to wait long for our food or asking for condiments. Highly recommend giving this place a try next time you are in Vegas!"
2884,Hash House A Go Go,5,"my first time here, and i love this place already. the kiwi lemonade are to die for.. lol"
2885,Hash House A Go Go,5,Our first time and it won't be the last. Awesome Hash Browns and Meatloaf. Mary personally made a visit to our table to share her meatloaf receive. Thanks Mary!
2886,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really really really good food! Talk about comfort food. The portions are big so come with an appetite and you should be fine. Dude, I actually had to share my meat loaf sandwich it was massive and not to mention the burger my daughter had she could barely finish half. I will be coming back soon but with a even bigger appetite next time lol :)"
2887,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions for good prices. You will need a to go box and a nap after this meal. Why don't you go go to hash house?!
2888,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG food orgasm.  Portions are completely huge.  4 of us couldn't finish 3 plates.  Maple brown sugar banana pancake is fantastic, and about the size of a medium pizza.  Big and fluffy, sweet enough that you don't need syrup.  There was a skillet of chorizo hash that I am told was really good but I didn't try it.  The sage chicken benedict was unreal.  Huge.  Comes with a steak knife and sprig of rosemary sticking out of it.  It's not just an eggs benedict with some fried chicken in it.  It's like 5 muffins with mashed potatoes, fried chicken, tomato, covered in a chipotle cream sauce and more.  It was amazing!  I can imagine the chicken & waffles plate is just as wonderful, from what I saw.  

The employees are fun and funny and crazy.  Very hip, all have mohawks or tattoos or piercings or some sort of attention-grabber.  Very cool people :)  They made it even more fun!"
2889,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Omg so much food!  My husband and I should have shared one plate, but couldn't agree on what to order. We actually came back a couple more times on that trip, just so we could try more things. Best hangover food. Huge portions, but good quality too.  It's inside a dining and casino complex, and a little hard to find the first time. They are always packed, and though sometimes the wait for a table and for your food can be a bit long, it's worth it bc  you will be sitting and working on your food for a long time. The staff are friendly too. Try to share though. Otherwise, you will have leftovers for a homeless person, unless you have a microwave in your hotel room."
2890,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Yelp much like luck isn't a lady.  After hearing good reviews about HHAGG my wife and I took the cab ride to Linq.  After finding the restaurant we were taken back by amount of people in the waiting area versus the restaurant space.  They were about even in size.  We then where told it's a 45 minute wait. Which is fine for a good meal. 
No buzzer, nor text app, allowing you to go into the lounge and maybe gamble but what do I know. Just an invitation to straight up wait in the tight overcrowded lobby.  We went to the bar and got coffee.  

The bartenders/servers were busy but our time at the bar allowed us to see that several tables were empty or not bussed yet and so the wait was now understandable.  
After an hour and 15 minutes. 
We were finally called to our table.  
Waited 5 minutes for attention but after our very nice waiter (who was also the very busy bartender) came over.   Our lobby exile allowed us to be prepared to order. So we did. I the Roasted chicken... My wife salmon skillet... 35 minutes later after little attention(got coffee no cream) and surveying the slow turn around in restaurant our food finally arrived.  

Pretty; but the other side of luke warm. Like it was sitting under a food lamp for 18 minutes. 

Crispy potatoes stood out, but everything else was rather average at best. It was disappointing; I earned exceptional.  
By the way; everyone RAVED about their coffee, let me tell you good not great.  
Look it seemed that there wasn't much management in the place and the space/time wasn't maximized. My wife, who normally could care less, was looking for efficiency apps to share with the hostess. I say ""honey that all exists"". My wife hates clutter!  

Side note: After the meal, we had to walked the 2 flights of stairs because the escalator was out for over the now 2 1/2 hour breakfast experience.

Look from the plates of others the food is big, well plated and decently priced but someone expecting to start the day with a breakfast experience, that is sexy, fun & exceptional; this Hash House A Go Go was average at best!

It would have earned 2 1/2 stars for my 2 1/2 hours delay they ""blessed"" me with."
2891,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Was told that the M Hotel and casino had the best food so we went to the Buffet the night before and had a great meal , probably the best buffet in town.  Since the buffet was so great we decided to have breakfast at the Hash House A Go Gp at the same hotel, big mistake.  I had the fried chicken and waffles which wasn't bad and my wife and my wife had the basic breakfast which was scrambled eggs and biscuit .  The service was slow since they seem to be a little short on help, I guess I was just expecting more since the buffet the night before was so great.  My conclusion is to have the buffet but skip the breakfast there"
2892,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Overrated.

We had to wait a while to get seated. That's understandable, it's Vegas. However, service was not great. I ordered a drink, not saying that I wanted the souvenir cup, thinking that the waiter would know that I meant I did NOT want it. When he brought it out and I told him that I didn't want the souvenir cup (because it was a higher charge), he seemed frustrated with me.

I got the chicken and waffles thinking it was a specialty, but the chicken was not seasoned well and was rather dry. The waffles were mediocre as well. The portions are big. Unfortunately, a lot of a not great thing is...still not great. Overpriced for mediocre food."
2893,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was decent, but prices are ridiculously high. This dish is their highly sought Chicken and waffles. It was ok,but the taste of sage was overpowering."
2894,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food! This place has some of the best tasting food I've ever eaten. The portions are very big so it actually comes out to be cheaper than you think. The only thing is that there is a long wait to get a seat so you might want to go to another location.
2895,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wtf!  Eating here took 5 years off my life!  I had the eggs and corned beef hash, and the waitress shows up with an iron skillet with 5 lbs worth of food, including biscuit , fruit, etc.   Awesome breakfast, love the food and portion size.   Would get 5 stars, but minus 1 star for slow service and that long long line in front. Ouch."
2896,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Life's too short to eat bad food and this place wasted an hour of my life.  
I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.  What was put before me was not a twist on a classic but a total insult to a classic.  A large portion of food was thrown on to a platter sized plate to make you say ""wow"" when you see it.  I did.  Partly because I thought I had received the wrong dish.  
Then I tried to eat it.  A dinner plate sized ""cracker crust"" that was about 90% inedible.  The crust had the texture of a medium/hard jerky.  I couldn't even cut it with a knife and fork.  Seriously.  ""Cracker Jerky Crust"" might be more accurate.  At the bottom of the pile there was some mash that was just mash.  Slopped on top of that was the ""filling"" that was OK.  Lots of chicken but there better be for the price they charge.
Evidently no one on the tv shows that I've seen ordered this dish.  I saw a picture of it in the photo section.
There are a lot of good meals to be had in Vegas.  Don't waste an hour of your life at this place."
2897,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The serving sizes are huge. Filled me up for two whole meals. I got the Andys Famous Sage Fried Chicken Breast w/maple reduction, two eggs your style, bacon mashed potatoes and biscuits. The crust on the chicken was super crispy. The mashed potatoes were nice and chunky and the biscuit came with strawberry jelly that was a good compliment to the savory chicken. Again, huge portions. Totally worth it."
2898,Hash House A Go Go,3,Bloody Mary was delicious. Portions are so huge that I felt bad ordering knowing I couldn't even finish half. Had the ranchero plate. It was ok. My bf ordered the grilled chicken sandwich but it came out pretty dry and over cooked. No beers on tap.
2899,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Great service, nice atmosphere, food is not at all my thing - big portions of mediocre carbs and grease. I feel like there are better ways to blow your diet and don't understand the appeal.

Ordered the Chicken and Waffles - a 12 inch tower of 4 waffles, 2 breaded chicken breasts, fried green onion stalks, a stalk of rosemary, and a tiny cup (2 tablespoons?) of syrup. After deconstructing the tower to try to actually eat it, I found the chicken tasted decent on it's own (however there was a hidden leg bone, maybe 3 inches long, sticking out of the gigantic breasts, which I have no idea why it was left there and surprised there have not been several choking accidents as it's hidden in the mound of food), the waffles (which had overcooked bacon strips underneath) were so dry because there was not enough syrup, and the fried green onion stalks were tough and inedible - did not at all make for wonderful culinary bites. BF ordered the BBBLT (a bacon bacon BLT) - super thick greasy texas toast, 10 pieces of burned bacon, a sliver of tomato and a leaf of lettuce - after a few bites he removed most of the bread and barely touched his fries. We both felt grose after eating 1/4 of our entrees. The highlight of the meal was the giant biscuit covered in butter and honey - should have eaten that and left as we would have been full."
2900,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When Yelp tells you the portion is big then listen to it!! One order was enough to feed 2-3 people. The hostess in the front were kind of rude, but if the food is good then whatever. They don't even matter! The servers were really quick and the restaurant seem a little dark. The price was really reasonable for the amount of food that you get. 

The Chicken and Waffle: there was four waffles and like 4 pieces of chicken in this. The waffle were crispy and thick. The chicken were fried to a crisp with juicy meat inside. Very good!

The Basic: this has two eggs, two sausage, a biscuit, potatoes and a slice of cantaloupe. This was just a basic breakfast. The sausage was not that good, very soft and mushy. The potatoes and biscuit was amazing and cooked to perfection. 

I would definitely come back here and get breakfast or brunch!"
2901,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing.  You must go HUNGRY!  The Bacon, Bacon, Bacon was amazing.  Candied Bacon.  
The portions were unbelievable.  Shared a dish : chicken benedict.   Saw many other dishes come out, they were all huge portions.

Definitely would recommend and go again next time we are in Vegas."
2902,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh my goodness.... I have heard about this place from the show ""Man Vs. Food"" and it looked amazing so when we went to Vegas I had this place as a possible dinning experience. One night at about 4 in the morning we decided to go eat and chose here to try out and we were not disappointed in the least. The food was spectacular I ordered the biscuits and gravy while my fiancÃ© got the hamburger bother we're extremely big meals. It tasted so great with the biscuits soaking up all that yummy gravy and my eggs were so nice and yellow. I really want to go back again just to get that food or try new ones but I do love my meal lol."
2903,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place! The food, OMG the food is really good and the amount is huge! If you eat all the food you get then you're a miracle worker haha The staff is friendly but there is no cell service in there for some reason. Oh well!"
2904,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is touristy but a must try. Great food & atmosphere. TVs, music & the food is magnificent. Take your time & eat slow."
2905,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So good!  Portions are HUGE. I would share a meal next time. It takes a long time for food to come out, but they warn you about that because everything is made so fresh."
2906,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You want a big-ass burger? Look no further.

Hash House A Go Go has one-pound burgers by default. Yes, you will literally weigh an extra pound after finishing a creation that takes up most of your plate.

Will you have a food coma afterwards? Youbetcha. Is it worth it? Absolutely."
2907,Hash House A Go Go,4,Sure so much in Vegas deserves all the stars but if not for the fact that you can get great food 24hours a day here at the very least come for the biscuits and Bloody Mary - they do not disappoint
2908,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I came here for one thing and one thing only, the Chickens and Waffles. I was sold after seeing the picture. It was the #1 thing I had to get when I was in Vegas. 

Little did I know that they did not serve it on their late menu. I got sooooooooooo fucking pissed that my gf knew I was being like a kid and throwing a tantrum. What a FAIL! 

I had to make the best out of it so I decided I ended up getting the Indianas Favorites which came with Andys Sage Fried Chicken, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatos and a biscuit. 

The fried chicken was awesome. Perfectly made and so moist. It wasnt all greasy like the chicken you would get from KFC. If you like bacon, you will love the mashed potatoes.The gfs blueberry pecan flapjack was delicious and pretty humongous. 

Their 1 lb Angus burgers look mighty tempting also as I saw a few tables order them. 

One of my favorite beers is offered here, Arrogant Bastard in a 24 oz bottle. Gotta love that. 

Lastly I hated how this Hash House location is at Imperial Palace. This casino is just a complete fail. Ghetto as hell. Seriously do I have to take 2-3 different elevators just to get to the casino? Next time Im headed to 2nd Hash House location for my chicken and waffles. 

There you have it, 2 reviews in one."
2909,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The hype is well deserved- huge portions and reasonable prices. My wife and I split the chicken and waffles, which featured 2 pieces of fried chicken and 4 Belgian waffles- very filling and delicious. Will be back for brunch next time we're in Vegas for sure!"
2910,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Out of the three breakfast places we at at while in Vegas, Hash House was my favorite. 

Be warned, though: This is a very popular place. We went there on a Friday morning with a group of about 10 people, and we had to wait a good 30 minutes to get a table. Understandable since we did have a big group and the food here is so good.

I ordered a Scrambler with smoked salmon, basil pesto, tomato and melted brie cheese, and it was amazing! Loved it! It's not something I would have ordered normally, but for whatever reason I'd been on this salmon kick. Besides, I was on vacation, and I wanted to try something new. The risk totally paid off! It was delicious!

Since we were with such a big group, the service was a little slow and it took a while for our food to come out, but it was well worth the wait. 

Definitely check it out if you're staying near the Imperial Palace."
2911,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It was a ok.. Big portion cuz your dish is filled with potatoes!!!
We ordered in advance and went to pick it up. It was a very smart idea.. because there were long long waits. So instead of waiting there, we called, ordered and when we got there, we're ready to go. However, on the other hand, the waitress was not very helpful, and we had to stand and wait to pick up our order... so minus 1 star"
2912,Hash House A Go Go,1,Where to begin. We had a large party (8) so we figured we would have to wait. They told us 45 minutes...that's fine. An hour and a half later they seat us. Service was so. Freaking. SLOW!!!! The dining room was empty compared to the crowd outside waiting to be seated. Did I mention the service was so slow??? Our food came over an hour after we ordered it. I ordered biscuits and gravy. It came out cold. I sent it back and got another one. It came out luke warm at best...couldn't eat it. The burger my husband ordered was very good and so was the banana pancake. But the service. 3 hours to it. It was ridiculous. Will never go back.
2913,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Stumbled in to Hash House after a heavy day of partying like a rock star in Vegas. I ordered the sage benedict and was immediately transported in to an episode of man vs. food and I was up for the challenge. I took that benny down! 

Ok really my boyfriend and I split it and we could barely finish it but that carb overload did the job we were hoping it would. We zombied back to our hotel in a food coma and slept for a few hours. Was it healthy? No! but it was worth every delicious bite."
2914,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great deal on food for the price. At first I thought it was super expensive, but wait until you see how big the portions are. Like really... I'm not exaggerating. 

I ordered a brown sugar banana flapjack, which was delicious. But I was expecting something the size of my hand. Instead, this one flapjack is bigger than my torso. I also made the mistake of making it a combo and getting eggs and potatoes on the side.

I only finished 70% of my meal. But for $14, it basically served as breakfast AND lunch for me.

Definitely come and check it out, but come early so you aren't stuck waiting."
2915,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you've eaten here and can't get full off the portions of the food they serve here, you are clearly lying! the portion sizes at HH are ginormous! i have a huuuggge appetite, and i need to share with someone else to keep my tummy from exploding. i consider the prices a bargain for how much food we got and the quality of it. it's also nice that it's centrally located on the strip in imperial palace.

My first visit here, i ordered the corned beef hash loaded with baked potato chunks and topped with 2 eggs. i almost died trying to finish my half of the dish, but it did wonders to my massive hangover. 

i came here again this last weekend, and decided to try the popular sage fried chicken and waffles. the order came with two large breaded chicken breasts and 4 waffles. the breading was derish! but the chicken was really dry, and difficult to finish by the end of the meal. the waffles were amazing! i took my first bite of the waffle and realized that there were bacon strips grilled into the waffles. my friend, who is a loose vegetarian, looovvveeed the waffles.

we also ordered the fries. i don't know what was in the seasoning, but it was bomb! :) 

i tried a bunch of different dishes as well (to help my friends out... obvi!). the quesadilla, which was probably the size of 4 normal ones, was stuffed with potatoes, jalapenos, eggs and tomato. super flavorful and spicy. the sausage gravy pot pie looked nothing like a pot pie and overly rich with taste. the dish came with a ginormous piece of fried tortilla chip that looked like an upside down sombrero. i think that was the ""crust"" of the pot pie. the sausage gravy stuff was on top, and we realized later on that the huge mound of mashed potatoes was hiding under the sombrero chip. O_O

after we were done eating, even though the table still had a good portion of food on it, our waitress entertained us with the thought of dessert... maybe next time."
2916,Hash House A Go Go,5,The ambience is relaxing and I had a good time. If you're looking for American breakfast foods this is a good place.
2917,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our first stop in Vegas! This was recommended by a friend, so after checking into the Linq, we headed upstairs. We came around lunch time so it was super busy, the hostess quoted us a 30 minute wait, but we waited maybe 10 minutes tops. 

We were quickly seated and our waiter greeted us. I ordered their popular watermelon kiwi lemonade which is amazingg! Normal 5.99, but if you want the souvenir glass, it'll be 11.99. The husband ordered a lime margarita and later a strawberry lemonade margarita, both equally delicious. 

On to the food, so just sitting and looking around, the portions are ungodly. Pancakes the size of the serving plates, and chicken stacked on top of waffles. The husband ordered the mushroom Swiss burger, which comes with a double patty and fries. I ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken. 

I can't even begin to describe how amazing the food was. We devoured everything! The chicken was super crispy and the mashed potatoes was bacon and garlicky - my favorite flavors! 

This place is a must when you come to Vegas. Service was lacking but I don't blame them, they are crazy busy!"
2918,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're hungry, make your way to Hash Hash A Go Go. We got here on Saturday at noon and the wait was for 1 hour. We walked around the area and came back at 12:45 and our number was already called. So I guess the wait was much shorter than they told us which is great. We were ready to eat after reading all the reviews. 

Service: the service was great. Staff was nice.
Food: Food was overwhelming. So much food. I shouldn't be complaining about that. I ordered the famous chicken and waffle dish and my husband ordered the crab cake dish. Food presentation was great. Chicken was moist. Waffle was soggy. I prefer my waffle with a little crispness when it's just freshly made.  Crabcake was really good with the chipotle sauce. Biscuit and mashed potatoes are both okay. You won't leave hungry."
2919,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food might look scary! There is so much going on your plate (Chicken Benedict Breakfast) but it was so delicious.  You get a huge piece of fried breast, home made biscuit, fresh tomatoes and spinach, their unique potatoes, eggs, cheese and their special Chipotle sauce. It was such a great tasting experience with every bite. The servings are humongous so one plate can serve two. We still had left overs. The service was unbelievable, great wait staff (Happy workers). Man vs Food did not go wrong."
2920,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg!! My friend recommended this place and it didn't disappoint. Well worth the 30 minute wait. Huge portions and fresh!

My 14 year old son is a big eater so he ordered the sage chicken over bacon mashed with eggs and a biscuit. Sent a photo to his dad who commented ""not cool"" since he couldn't join. He did a good job TRYING to finish.

I went with the hash with chorizo, fresh jalapeÃ±os, tomatoes and cheese with eggs. Made a good dent but couldn't finish it either 

Definitely coming back here and bringing the hubby!!"
2921,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Had dinner here on Sunday night and it is so not worth the money. The food was cold and dried out, The cheeseburgr had no cheese and when I asked the waiter his reply was he would get me some for an extra 95 cents. Service was horrible and the hostesses were so dis functional  the table they sat us at was in the middle of the door way, It felt  like we were on parade!!!! It was a total night mare and I will never go back. So please don't waste your money !!!! I will be sure to tell all my clients and there friends ..."
2922,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Sage fried chicken Benedict and waffles were AMAZING! Great customer service, quick turn out of food after ordering, a must come to! 
And 24 hours!"
2923,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow, this place is pretty busy so expect a wait Saturday morning. They told us it would be about 45 minutes so our party of 4 scattered to check out the new LINQ. 25 minutes later I came back up while my wife went to the restroom. I asked how much longer the wait would be and the hostess told us they had called us and jumped our spot but if we waited, we could be seated within 10 minutes. My son and his friend walked up just behind me and it was still going to be less than the 45 minutes that we were told or expected. Just as we sat down [3 of us], they called us back. NO 10 MINUTE WAIT! HUH! That was still OK but seemed a little unorganized. 

When the 3 us walked up, the hostess asked us if our entire party was here and I explained that my wife was in the restroom but on her way. She starts to tell me that we all have to be there to be seated.. as she is telling me this the cashier tells her to go ahead and seat us. THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENED! The hostess rolled her eyes. 

NOW, normally my kids, family and close friends know I don't tolerate that kind of response. I quickly quipped something back that was not nice not vulgar either. I did mention that she should refrain from rolling her eyes at clients and maybe something about her being cross-eyed [she was]. BUT, I did make it quietly and short since my son had a friend from college with him and I did not want to embarrass him. I also don't know if she rolled her eyes at me or at the cashier.

Anyways they took us to a booth and I explained that i had asked for a table. I hate booths, what is your choice: table or booth? As we are traveling back through the main door my wife met up with us and we were taken to a table. A few minutes later, as we were looking through the menu, there was an incident where a table next us that could have 6 persons had about 9. They were arguing with the waitress, hostess and some manager that was just king of hovering. We didn't pay much attention, we were amazed by the plates that were moving across the floor. We all decided quickly to SHARE the chicken and waffles [1 plate per couple] and we still both took some home.

THE FOOD. Regardless of the initial problems, the food is good enough to give the House 4 stars. The restaurant is creative and the quality of food is good enough to justify waiting and even having to deal with a few minor problems. Our service was good and we all agreed that we would love to come back and try some of the delicious looking dishes that were being delivered around us.!

The place is kind of loud. It is big and your hearing plates being delivered, busboys throwing plates into a bin and a lot of laughter but it fits the ambiance. Next time I want to try the.... well the...Yeah, I need to come here a few times."
2924,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We were greeted promptly and seated after
a very brief wait.  Elena the hostess is one
of the best we have seen.  She was friendly,
efficient, competent, always knew what was
happening, and never stopped moving.  They
should give her a raise.

Hash House puts their own twist on restaurant
fare and their food is always tasty.
The entrees are slightly larger than average,
but the portion size for the side vegetables
is modest.

This particular location is open 24 hours,
so there is always an alternative to fast food
for late night diners."
2925,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food and service! 
Huge portions of very tasty food that is perfect for a hangover cure or surprising friends. 
Prices are a little higher but the amount and quality of the food is well worth it. 
Try the snickers pancake (share with the entire table, it's huge!)"
2926,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Oh l really wanted to like this place and give it a higher rating but unfortunately I can not. The service was sub par, our waiter did not come check on us not once after we got our food and normally when my husband and l go to a restaurant and we order water the waiter will usually ask if we would like to order something else to drink. He did not offer us a box for our food, even though we clearly had more than enough to save, didn't ask us if we needed anything else after we got our order. Also, it took him quite a while to bring us our receipt to sign for after he ran the debit card. I ordered a vanilla waffle and it was really tasty and big. My husband order hash that came with chicken and asparagus, it was definitely missing something, the flavor was not all the way there. His meal came with warm fruit :/ . I will not be returning"
2927,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I have to say that the Hash House in San Diego was a lot better. The only reason i gave this place two stars is because i had a lot of fun due to the environment of the restaurant. 

First off... its in one of the cheapest hotels on the strip. I was surprised that they actually chose the imperial palace as their location. I think it would fit better in the planet hollywood or hard rock hotel but thats just my opinion. 

This place was very crowded but that does not excuse the poor service. Other locations are equally as busy but still manage to provide decent food drinks and service. 

The drinks here were so so and the food was alright. The service was piss poor. Half our food barely made it out and when it did it was incomplete. 

To speak on behalf of the Hash House brand... Hash House has a crazy odd menu with large pizza pan size pancakes, bag of bud light and bacon, giant biscuits with gravy, and excellent bloody marys. Its definitely worth a try.

All in all, If you want interesting food and in large portions this is the place for you."
2928,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Overrated for average food. Definitely quantity over quality. Long wait to be seated and a long wait for your food to arrive. Be prepared to spend a couple of hours here. The restaurant was really loud making it hard to have any kind of conversation. I can't complain about the service because our server was very attentive. I ordered the smoked salmon scramble thinking it would be like the lox smoked salmon, instead I got chunks of weird tasting salmon. The pesto, melted Brie, and other ingredients were really nice together. I just had to pick out the main ingredient which was the salmon. Pretty disappointing. If you are not a big eater I recommend ordering from the kids menu. I saw so much food being wasted here it was troubling to me. Very unnecessary."
2929,Hash House A Go Go,3,The restaurant is located inside the Linq hotel. The restaurant gives massive portion sizes. The food is okay but I would recommend getting the chicken and waffles. That was pretty good.
2930,Hash House A Go Go,3,This place really lives up to its reputation.  The food was amazing and so was the service.  My concerns are to the location of this eatery.  Honestly I really can't believe the old Imperial Palace wasn't condemned and blown up.  Don't let the new name (The Quad Resort &Casino) fool you....its still the nasty Imperial palace...but hey!  Its Vegas and you probably wont notice because you are either drunk or hungover.
2931,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great service, great menu and awesome food! Everyone at my table (eight of us) ordered something different (I had the meatloaf) and everyone loved their meals. Great timing between the appetizers and the meal and all of our food came out at the same time. The staff was on point, had quick answers to all of our questions, took great care of us while not hovering or interrupting us every few minutes like some places. The prices were great too for the HUGE portions that they serve. Will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!"
2932,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House puts good food in front of you in portions that would feed you for a week. Take a good Sunday breakfast - say bacon and eggs - and inflate it to triple its normal size and add a pancake larger than most pizzas. 
Simply put, it's really tasty, good ol' home-style comfort food. I've always gotten a combo with a premium pancake for a dollar more which comes with some scrambled eggs and sausage. 

If you like breakfast or diner food, this is the place to go. you'll love it. And you won't leave hungry, that's for sure."
2933,Hash House A Go Go,1,Victor was our waiter and he was horribly rude. The food was a pile of different things smashed together with zero flavor. I won't be back.
2934,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've been a huge fan of HHAGG since love at first bite. Friends and I would make the trek to the stand alone location on Sahara blvd after a drunken night of debauchery. It was rated G....swear.

Very hearty portions....I use the term hearty lightly here. Ginormous portions! 

I do however fancy the stand alone location. For one reason, SOFT scrambled eggs. It is so rare to find scrambled eggs that are creamy rather than incredibly firm. The location on Sahara always did a good job at that...and I believe their signature way of doing them. All the locations should stay consistent with that even of they are on the strip."
2935,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Took the escalator upstairs and saw quite a bit of people waiting. We figured it would take almost an hour, but only took about 20 minutes. This place has tons of seating. I got the sage fried chicken Benedict which I thought was pretty tasty. Did feel that the biscuit was a little dry. My wife got some eggs potatoes which were delicious and French toast. She couldn't finish it because the portions are huge! Would go back! Our waiter with the tall Mohawk was on it. Great waiter!"
2936,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Tried the Corn Beef Hash during breakfast morning hour.  Was good...but even though the plate looks big...a little deceiving since most of it was the potatoes.  Overall, a very different Pig/Cow themed restaurant upstairs from the lobby of the The Quad hotel.  A bit pricey maybe for some folks.  With tip and coffee, price comes out to be about $20.  But you're on the strip so that price is probably normal.  I don't know why the wait time was so long since there were many empty tables on the back.  But once at the table, the service was pretty quick."
2937,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ever since I saw the episode of Man vs Food I have wanted to try the sage fried chicken benedict and when I went to Imperial Palace was delighted to see a Hash House a go go, so as soon as I unpacked we headed there and I must say this was a real man v food challenge the meal was huge I got the sage fried chicken benedict and my friend got a stuffed 1 pound burger we both enjoyed the meal but neither of us finished it, it was just too big."
2938,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The Hash House is nice, unique. The atmosphere was cool. It's at the LINQ hotel. My people enjoyed some pancakes with bacon. I tried the BLT. Theres only one thing wrong with the place,  besides the bacon and potatoes being too salty.... the portions were too big for a big guy like me! I suggest you should GET SOME if you like salty potatoes and salty meats and large portions of things to eat."
2939,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I went one late morning for brunch extremely excited because of all the reviews on yelp and the menu does just look mouth watering. However, the portions are HUGE but the food is just not that great. Prices are a little high but you need to think about the amount of food you are getting. I tried the chicken and waffles which was a let down. The spinach and cheddar eggs were good, but again, nothing out of this world."
2940,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Portions are HUGE HUGE HUGE.  Seriously, they get 5-star for portion size and presentation.  Everything they brought out looked amazing.  Chicken & waffles seemed to be a big draw for people around the restaurant, as the servers were bringing it out to everyone.

You can get breakfast at all hours - which is nice.

The place is big and very crowded.  I imagine that no matter what time you go, you will encounter a crowd - and maybe have to wait.

Prices were surprisingly good, not expensive in comparison to the food you received.

I thought the food was average - nothing stuck out in my mind.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was amazing either.   I'd go back."
2941,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best go to spot for brunch. It's hard to find, inside Imperial Palace, but once you find it, it def is worth the trip. I had the Trucker Special with the French toast griddle. Best French toasts I've ever had!! 
I recommend to share an entree, the servings are huge. If you decide to have your own plate, be prepared to have leftovers. But who doesn't love leftovers?! I know I do!"
2942,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I didn't waste any time going to Hash House A Go Go right when I got off the plane.  I was HUNGRY!!  And I wanted a big meal that wasn't a buffet.  Plus, it was one meal that I really wanted to get it over with since it basically kicked off what was my Food Tour through the Vegas Strip and was the biggest and most intimidating meal that I would encounter.

Since I've already had their Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles and Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, I went with a change of pace and tried their Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict.  And just like the other two dishes, once I saw my waitress bringing it to my table, I immediately started cracking up because it was so enormous (http://bit.ly/1KIcQLz).   It's a loaded plate - Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin w/ market Yellow Tomato, Spinach, BBQ Cream, topped w/ Scrambled Eggs all over two Biscuits and a Griddled Mashed Potatoes.  The Pork Tenderloin was good. If you've ever had Tonkatsu at a Japanese restaurant, it's pretty much the same deal, only 10x's bigger.  And I did pretty well, managed to kill the Pork Tenderloin and left one Biscuit behind.

Washed it all down with their house special Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade (http://bit.ly/1YwCGrU).  A friend of mine recommended it and even my waitress said it went well with everything on the menu.  They were right!  Very refreshing and colorful too!!

This experience was a lot better than my last visit 9 months ago.  Probably because this time I opted for a table and not a seat at the bar.  The service was definitely better as my waitress was very enthusiastic.  Also the $10 Restaurant.com coupon helped make it a good experience too!  So good service, big food, and full stomach.  It was a great way to start off my Food Tour on the Strip."
2943,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious. Our table shared the meatloaf hash, a peanut butter and banana pancake and biscuit with gravy. Crazy good. Short wait, great server. What else can I say? I will definitely return on my next trip to Vegas."
2944,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg I love this place came here for breakfast and the food was very tasteful. The chicken, eggs, biscuits was delicious .. But I'm a bacon person so babe order me alot .. All the food was well cook..  We would definitely be back soon..  My Lemonade drink was the best"
2945,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Unfortunately when we went there was s huge wait and the place was under construction (hopefully to add more space). 

Our waiter was on the ball. And the food was amazing! If you are looking for large portions that are high quality and reasonably priced (for Vegas) this is the place for you. 

I had the chorizo hash with over easy eggs. Even with the place being packed my food was piping hot when it came out. It was cheesy and spicy, everything I was looking for that morning. I didn't touch the tortilla it came with, but the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! 

My only suggestion is go early. We got there at 9:30 and the place was hopping!"
2946,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Absolutely jaw dropping food when it's served, and it tastes just as good.
Their signature BLT Bloody Mary was a meal in itself.  We ate at both the one in the Imperial Palace on the Las Vegas strip as well as the one at The Plaza Hotel in old Vegas.  Both were excellent, but the one in old Vegas has much less of a line.
If you go to the one on the strip, eat at the bar so you won't have to wait.
The prices were VERY reasonable for the amount of food you get, and two people can easily split an entree. Their sage fried chicken benedict was beyond words!
You HAVE to check this place out...especially after a night of partying."
2947,Hash House A Go Go,3,"A hang over cure? yes. A culinary must? No. 

The best part of my meal was that they serve great coffee. No cream, no sugar. That's about where the impressiveness stopped. 

I ordered the fried chicken Benedict dish. I was craving fried chicken and something hearty to rejuvenate me from a weekend of drinking the equivalent in my weight. Fried chicken breast atop mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. Stuffed with spinach and bacon, smothered in hollandaise sauce. Just what the dr ordered....or so I thought. 

The dish was fine, just nothing too memorable. With a 'as shown on man v food' tag on the menu, you'd expect delicious. I shoulda realized it meant, 'too much food for any person to ever eat in one sitting'. 

If you're staying nearby and are just looking for food, sure. But don't waste your time going out of the way to eat here."
2948,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome breakfast/ brunch 

Chicken and waffles are a must- enough to feed three adults! 

Hubby had spicy salmon eggs Benedict - great pick too!"
2949,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Seriously, huge huge portions! Our group of four shared three plates of food and were seriously stuffed. The whole restaurant is farm-styled and their specialties are their hashes!

Definitely order anything off of the Hash breakfast entrees

We ordered:
HH Roasted Chicken
HH Meatloaf
Warm Spinach Salad

The roasted chicken was really dry, so maybe that's one hash plate you should avoid. The meatloaf plate was very pleasing and is well worth trying! Our spinach salad had waay too much dressing than my liking.

Also, be prepared for a wait :( 15-20 mins"
2950,Hash House A Go Go,2,We heard a lot about this place and stopped by for breakfast one morning on our recent trip to Vegas.  The place is much nicer than the casino it's located in and the service was pretty good.  Overall I guess we had pretty high expectations and I was a little let down.  The kitchen staff wasn't on with timing the orders because both our table and another near us had only one of the meals served while the other person had to wait about 4-5 minutes for there's.  When I finally got my breakfast the eggs were cold and the waffle was warm not hot.  Overall the meal was OK but nothing to get excited about.
2951,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here last summer during a bachelor party. 4 strapping young men carbo loading for a 5 day grand canyon hike, we could not have asked for a better spot. There was a wait, but we got there early so it wasnt too bad. The hash skillets were great and andy's fried chicken benedict was also really good. Service is what you would expect from a jam packed brunch place serving the only decently priced breakfast in vegas. I took my Buffet loving dad here and he hasnt stopped talking about it since. Strongly recommended."
2952,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ate Breakfast at the Hash House in January 2015, and really enjoyed the food and the experience.

The Hash House is located on the second floor of the Linq hotel.

The staff were all very friendly and courteous.

The food is great, a large selection of comfort foods, all taste great.  the portions are very large.  The cost is reasonable based on the amount of good food you receive.

The have a full bar with awesome Bloody Mary's.

I look forward to eating here again, next time I'm in the area, and would recommend this restaurant to my family and friends."
2953,Hash House A Go Go,4,All I have to say is this place has MAN v.s. Food Portions (Food Network Show). Their menu serves something for every taste. I ordered the bacon filled belgian waffles (OMG) topped with two maple syrup infused fried chicken breast (OMG) with soy bbq sauce drizzle and fried leeks. Need I say MORE? Very interesting flavors mixed together. This place is awesome in more ways then one. Definatley a must see and must eat at place in Vegas. Don't come to Vegas without trying this place.
2954,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House has huge portions of delicious, high quality, American favorites. There is no way one person can finish a single entree, so you should probably plan on sharing dishes.

We sat at the bar and were thoroughly entertained by the bar tender who was hilarious. All the servers and waitresses were extremely welcoming and happy!

The fried chicken here is AMAZING, whether it's on a waffle covered with syrup, or a biscuit covered with gravy. The food is very rich, very fatty, and just the way I like it."
2955,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great customer service and I highly recommend trying their chicken and waffles. It's huge!
2956,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Get the fried chicken!!! Was cooked sooo well. The food is massive and recommended to split in my mind. Not a biscuit fan and everything seems to come with one. In my opinion they were very dry, skip it of you can. The wait was long on a Friday morning but they work their butts off and get people in and out without being rude."
2957,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I used to live in Vegas and my friends told me that I had to come here for breakfast but weekends are out because it's so busy. Well, being a teacher, I only worked during the week so never got out there. I no longer live in Vegas but went back for a visit and happened to get there during the week so the first place I thought of was...BREAKFAST at HASH HOUSE A GO GO! I was not disappointed at all. Some people do not like it because you have to take the food as is (no special orders). I figured, they throw food together for a reason so why mess with it. The food was great, very large portions, and the staff was awesome. They really are pretty busy and do get large parties so I found my server taking a long time taking one order. No problem since the manager was around and could refill my drink. Worth trying at least once."
2958,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Greeting- yes
Vibe- school basement
Prices- good
Bathroom - downstairs in casino pass/ fail
Service- good
Food
Crazy big portions. Sage chicken and waffles can feed 2 -$20
WIGB? Probably not
It's like the Cheesecake Factory on steroids"
2959,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm giving this place 4 stars because who charges for ranch. Ha! Seriously the food was delicious, but there is just WAYYY too much. I understand that this is their concept, but I can't help but think of how much food is wasted from this place. Found this place on Yelp and had heard people going to it in other cities so had to try it out. Went early Saturday morning and it was packed. Fortunately, I was with a part of 6 and they told us that if our entire party was there at the moment then they could sit us right away...as the other large parties were waiting on people. Worked out in our favor! We ordered right away after the huge menu consumed us, but we got a wide variety of things to try. Everything was delicious and we were definitely able to take leftovers to the other part of our group that couldn't quite get out of bed as early as we did. Overall, I would definitely go back...but just be prepared, every meal needs to be shared between two maybe even three people."
2960,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yum. Just yum. I had the crab cake Benedict and it was amazing. Not too fishy tasting like some places. Also the portions are HUGE!  you could easily share an entree with someone. The mimosas were also delicious. I had the tangerine mimosa which was very refreshing. And they serve it in a large to go size. So fun. This is my favorite brunch spot in Vegas.  The line was very long with a 40 minuet wait but it was worth it. We just headed down to the casino to kill time.
2961,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After two disappointing dinners, I wanted to take my family somewhere with reliably good food.  Having been to the San Diego location (of which I still have fond memories), I knew Hash House was the way to go.

It was a bit of a challenge finding the restaurant (go to the center of the Imperial Palace casino and take the escalator up), but the hostess was friendly and courteous and we were seated after just five to ten minutes of waiting.

We ordered the sage fried chicken benedict, meatloaf hash, and griddled french toast.  The meatloaf hash consisted of blocks of underseasoned meat nestled amongst huge blocks of potatoes, which gave an overall effect of dry mushiness.  The fried chicken benedict was pretty good, but I didn't eat much of it because the french toast was right in front of me and I LOVE FRENCH TOAST.  This one was no disappointment; the big, fluffy toast tasted great with the banana cinnamon cream, blackened banana and toasted pecans.  I forced myself to finish the whole thing because it was just that good.

Overall my family was happy with the amount and quality of the food.  A warning though: Hash House serves up diet-busting, waistline-expanding, food coma-inducing goodness.  For the sake of everyone on the road, please don't eat here right before making a 4+ hour drive home.  Trust me, you'll regret it."
2962,Hash House A Go Go,4,The portions are HUGE! If I went back I would just get one plate to split. I got the chicken and biskets and waffles.  They were both very good and lived up to the hype.
2963,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I'm assuming this is the location inside the Quad (formerly Imperial Palace)

We went for breakfast on a friday morning so it was pretty crowded but we got seated within 15minutes. 
The waiter was very informative, almost to the point of being insulting so that rubbed me the wrong way. 

he asked if we had been there before and then explained about the large portion sizes and stuff and then left us to figure out what we wanted.
and left us.... and left us... and left us
and finally came back to take our order

i wanted eggs, bacon and pancakes (i'm boring) 
and he asked what i wanted in my pancake (berries, walnuts, etc)
i said ""nothing, just a plain buttermilk pancake""
he said (with a disgusted look on his face) ""uh, this isnt IHOP, these arent ordinary pancakes.""
i assured him that i just wanted a plain pancake and he shoo'd me off and walked away.

the portions were big but they werent anything to write home about

the guy killed it for us though. wont be going back."
2964,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great breakfast meals but took 1 hour to be seated and took 45 mins to go get your food. Good ole american (breakfast) lunch when u get your food.
2965,Hash House A Go Go,5,I've been here twice now and it's no less impressive. The food is in massive portions and the flavors are delicious. Both times I've been it has been packed. Reservations would be helpful if you don't want to wait. But be aware reservations are only taken 24h in advance.
2966,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So good. Definitely split an entree, and this is coming from a fairly big guy who loves to eat."
2967,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food was amazing!!! HUGE portions so beware!! I suggest sharing!!! Food coma after leaving this place!
2968,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A-mazing! Portions are huge and very, very tasty. The brown sugar banana pancake is sweet, warm and gooey. The chicken salad sandwich is layered with great flavor. Whatever happens in Vegas stays there unless you eat here cause you gotta take home leftovers and I was glad the next day at home when I had them. Our biggest regret was not ordering one more whole entree to take home too."
2969,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Second time coming here for brunch. The first time was last year when we didn't know what we were getting into. The pancakes are the size of a sm/med. pizza. This time we knew how to order. 

We ordered the combo with a pancake, sausage, and scrambled eggs. We split it and added on two pieces of bacon extra crispy and two eggs over medium. Everything came out exactly as ordered. We ordered whipped topping on the side for the hubs and extra butter for me and they got that right too. 

Only thing we would do next time is just get the sausage instead of the bacon. The bacon was a little too smoky for us but the sausage was perfecto!

There seems to always be a wait here but the tables are cleared and cleaned quickly. They have it down. The server we had was great too. 

This will definitely be on our list to visit again when we're back in Vegas."
2970,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband and I came here after hearing all the rave about the place. We walked here all the way from our Hotel New York New York, which wouldn't be such a bad idea, except for the fact that we were almost starving for food and it was so hot. We got to the place finally  and it was PACKED!! People waiting everywhere, it's a bit hidden so I really wasn't expecting such a big wait. We waited 45 minutes for a table. Our waiter was GREAT! I told him I woke up craving a waffle, scrambled eggs, hash browns, and biscuits & gravy. He put something together for me that included all those things but since they don't have hash browns I got country potatoes. Everything was Excellent!!! It was sooo good I wish I could've finished it all. The waffle was HUGE took up the whole plate. Its a big place with a good look and even better food! I will be going back for sure"
2971,Hash House A Go Go,5,"""1 word... large portions"" was what our server said upon greeting us at 3am. Well he was right! We ordered the Chicken Benedict and it was a wonderful combo of mashed potato, biscuit, egg, chicken, spicy gravy, spinach, and perfectly fried chicken. I may have missed another ingredient because they were piled on each other like a mountain. I usually don't like this form of ""plating"" (if you can call it that). Yet, everything worked and was perfect. I enjoyed it so much, I came back for breakfast... brunch... lunch... linner? Don't judge me, we were just here at 3am... next meal... cut to 3 pm. Ordered the Trucker Breakfast and a Smore Mocha. Smore Mocha was yummy, just hard to drink bc of their ""plating?"" It was drenched in chocolate syrup (not the drink, but the cup). I had to rip the cup of the plate bc the syrup glued the two pieces together. It wasn't discouraging enough to take any stars off their rating though. The waffle with banana was AMAZING.  So, basically... just come eat here. Be prepared to stuffed and sticky ;-)."
2972,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a great place to go and share breakfast with someone you love. Every meal looks too big for one person. I had the fried chicken and eggs but only ate half the chicken, half the bacon, half the potatoes, half the fruit, and both eggs. 

I think your life expectancy would definitely go down if you ate here everyday! ;)  We watched plate after plate of food go by and the absurd amount of food brought joy to my heart. 

Service was great. Our waitress knew the menu inside and out and looked like she had actually eaten everything on the menu. She was confident in helping us decide between different dishes if we couldn't decide. And the price was pretty decent too!"
2973,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Good food and good service at friendly prices in Vegas?  Sure, I'll take it.  

The hubby and I took our best shot at eating the fried chicken benedict.  The waiter did warn us about how huge that Single platter of food is.  The hubby & I were super hungry, but we could only eat a little over 1/2 of that platter.  The fried chicken, bacon, veggies, cheese, eggs, biscuit, potatoes, sauce, and about 5 other items (LOL!) were good, and a super deal for the price.

I also had an iced coffee which was not my preferred ""rocket fuel"" but still pretty strong and tasty.

They just opened up one of these in Plano, TX.  Based on this spot, we will definitely check out the Plano one once we get home."
2974,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It was hard to decide what to order but this was the first stop on our honeymoon and man was it a good one. 

We were quoted a 15 minute wait time but it was closer to only 5 minutes which was excellent. My husband and I were able to sit next to each other at a booth which I thought was very cute. This was our first time here and we were quite impressed. 

Our waiter was a bit all over the place. We waited much longer for food than other tables around us but it was worth the wait. My husband had the fried pork tenderloin sandwich and it was delicious and hilarious since the bun was 1/4 of the size of the entire piece of pork. Fries were battered which I love and he really enjoyed the juicy pork. 

I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was incredible. Some of the best I've ever had. The waffle was sweet and smoky due to the addition of bacon which I adored. The hot sauce syrup was tasty and I just really like it. 

The side of biscuit and gravy was just obscene. The biscuit was huge and the puddle of gravy was excellent. 

It would have been a 5 star spot in my book if not for the very spotty service. I'd come again because the food and portions were phenomenal."
2975,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Word of mouth spreads fast for this place which is hidden inside one of the less stellar hotels of the strip (and I say this in the least snotty way possible). Came here based on a coworkers recommendation of LARGE PORTIONS, CHEAP PRICES (notice the emphasis, he basically yelled this at me). We get there and there is a whole crowd of people and a 1 hour wait time. We patiently wait next to a giant plastic cow until our names are called at which point once we are seated, our waiter informs us its another 45 minutes for food. Based on all this wait time, you expect something spectacular, right? Husband ordered the chicken and waffles and I just got their buttermilk pancake since I was planning to eat his food anyway. Well the LARGE PORTIONS definitely is true. Also, they bring out the food as its ready and not all together so I got my pancake like 15 minutes before he got his food which is kind of awkward but whatever. Chicken was okay, moist and flavorful. Waffles were a disaster, some weird smell. Also, for such large portions, really only 1 small cup of syrup?? I saw multiple tables request a plate of extra syrup cups. Total bill came to $24 for two entrees and an iced tea. I'm sure this review won't discourage those who have already bought into the hype (it's okay, I was one of those) but for those who have discerning tastes, skip this place unless it's convenient for you and there is less wait time. There is better quality food out there in the vast wonderland that is the Las Vegas Strip."
2976,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place.  The food is delicious, fresh and the portions are huge.  I love the chicken pot pie and it takes me about a week to eat it!"
2977,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had heard of Hash House A Go Go before and so when I came to Vegas, I knew I wanted to try it. 
I came in on a Friday around 10am and there was a 25-30 minute wait for our party of two. The wait wasn't too bad, at least for me, and I didn't feel like I was there forever. We ended up getting seated in a nice large booth and they gave us our menus. 
It took our waitress quite a long time to get to us, we already knew what we wanted to eat by the time she came over for our drink orders. After we ordered, it again took a pretty long time for her to bring us the waters and a coffee that we ordered, much longer than I would think for a pretty standard drink order. 
The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, nothing crazy. I got the hash with mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, and spinach. I got the eggs on the side for my friend to eat and I switched out the buttermilk biscuit for some wheat toast. My waitress assured me that the hash did not contain dairy, which made me feel good about my order. I really did enjoy the food, it tasted great and the portions were huge. Honestly, the food is the reason I'm giving 4 stars. My friend got the chicken fried steak and let me just say, this thing is GIGANTIC. My friend usually finishes all of their food anytime we eat together and they could barely eat half of this meal. 
Once we were done eating, I feel like it took FOREVER for our waitress to bring us the check and for me to get a box. We actually had to stop our  waitress and ask for the check and box after she was helping another table. I understand that they're busy, but I feel like I was seeing a lot of other waiters in our area a lot more often than our own. 
All in all, the food here is really good, but I think the service could use some work."
2978,Hash House A Go Go,3,"There's a few nice things and some not great things about this place. Nice things is: 1) the plates are big so you can share if you like. 2) the price is good and bad and I'll tell you why! Its good for the amount of food you're getting but it's bad because of the quality of food. 

So this place i guess got popular due to the T.V show Man vs. Food since the plates are big. That guy loved it because he goes in the kitchen and cooks with chef so the food is fresh therefore he liked it I'm sure. But lets just say ""the food looks better than it tastes""  because the food's quality sucks, it is not fresh and its like cheap buffet style and you can tell that's how its done. I got a hash dish and the patatoes were cold, not crispy and buffet style, so were the veggies placed on top. My husband got the famous dish and the chicken was the same way, not crispy and buffet style kind. I guess with the amount of people that go in and out of this place they have to do it like that which is to pre-make foods, and store it in buffet style containers and stacks ingredients on top of each other."
2979,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food has to be what you want - when you want it ...to be reallllly good. This place manages to do that.  Mingling all sorts of food together that you wouldn't think should be on the same plate. It all works.  Way too much food for one person to be eating at on setting - share your plates as you'll want to taste your friends food. So. In one word... Yum.
2980,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Soooooo much food, holy cow I'd recommend sharing a plate. Im not even exaggerating you will have food for days. The drinks were also very tasty, fast service, great waiter."
2981,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House is a Vegas staple for my family, whenever in town. The line is going to be ridiculous, but they go SO fast, so its worth it. 

I personally love the benedict's. It is SO much food, and very very tasty. My #1 recommendation? Anything Sage Fried Chicken. Its absolutely incredible! So juicy and tender, and some incredible flavor. Though pricey, the loaded bloody mary is absolutely delicious. 

If youre going for lunch, thy their burgers! They are stuffed with mashed potatoes!"
2982,Hash House A Go Go,4,Ordered for carry-out and was delighted to find a huge portion of corn beef hash! The only downside was my biscuit felt very dry when attempting to eat it. But over all this is a solid breakfast spot and I'm sure lunch and dinner will do fine. Wait time can be a little long to be seated in the AM.
2983,Hash House A Go Go,1,"""Do you have straws"" I asked a waiter once during breakfast. ""Yes we do have straws"" and just stood there and never brought us straws. In the end of that trip he asked us if we wanted drinks and when we replied yes he told us to hold on because he needed to remember his previous order. I get that I'm not going to a five star restaurant but I at least expect my water to be filled and not have my orders confused with others. I could spend all day writing bad reviews about this place because their food is awesome and I'm a local. But their poor customer service has turned me away. I would rather spend my money elsewhere."
2984,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This rating is so low because of the overall service.  We arrived at the restaurant at 10:45 on a Saturday and were told we would have 1 hour wait for 5 people.  We decided to wait, and were seated just shy of an hour.  We ordered our food and drinks as soon as the waiter came over.  After we ordered, he informed us that since they make everything fresh it would take 30 minutes to get our food.  It was 11:50 and we thought that would give us time to make our next events at 1:20 for three of us and 1:45 for the other two.  At 12:30, 40 mins later, we asked for an update and were again told that the kitchen was busy but we should be coming up soon.  At 12:50 my sister and her family had to leave to get to their event.  So we told the waiter to cancel their order and asked to see the manager.  The manager finally came over with one plate at 1:05 and apologized for the late meals.  We explained that some of us had to leave without eating because of the delay and that we would have to hurry and eat our meal to make our event.  He again apologized and said that that the server should have told us they were behind earlier.  After all this he gave us 25% off our meals.

The only saving grace (hence the 2 star and not 1) was the food.  It was good and there was plenty of it.  However, since we had to rush we really didn't get to enjoy the meal.

The hostess should have told customers of the wait when they put their names on the list.  As we were leaving we heard another person complain that they also had to wait an hour and 20 mins. to get their food.

25% off is not enough to make up for"
2985,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is insanely busy!!  Lines were insane, but well worth the wait. My banana pancake was mammoth. I really like the crunchy outer layer with their pancakes and moist of bananas in the inside.  If you love good breakfast, and huge portions, this is a good place to start your day. Make sure to designate someone to wait for your table so you don't miss out or you may have to wait again.

Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"
2986,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food here is most likely going to kill you, but you will die happy. It was absolutely delicious and visually awe inspiring. The portions were gigantic so unless you have a fridge in your hotel (which is not likely in Vegas) you will have a large amount of leftovers go to waste. I would definitely advise sharing a plate with someone if you can both agree on the same menu item. There were a lot to choose from and most are not things I have seen other places. Price is super reasonable, staff was friendly and it seemed to be a very clean place. 
Biggest complaint was the long wait. I don't mind waiting if there is a place to wait comfortably but that isn't the case here."
2987,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Wait - The wait wasn't that long considering there were at least 50 parties ahead of us. They estimated about 1-1.5 hour half but we only waited about 30-45 minutes. 

Food - All the food are large portions and good enough to share with 2 or more people. We had a party of 4 and got 2 chicken waffles to share, it was a little dry but the waffles had bacon in them which was pretty cool

Service - the service was outstanding, our waitress Abbey was attentive and got our refills immediately

Bathroom is downstairs in the casino, it's a long walk so I suggest going before or after 

Giving this a 3 star because the food wasn't as good as the hype made it seem to be. If the chicken was more tender and flavorful I'd give it 5 star"
2988,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'll always come here at least once when I'm in Vegas. The servings are huge, creative and always satisfying. The service is laid back but peompt. Be ready to pay $14 for a drink but it is Vegas after all. I've had Benedict and a 1/2 lb stuffed burger (#5), and haven't been let down yet. 

TIP: Order your drink before anything else... The wait can be longer than the food but worth it."
2989,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When visiting we were told we had to go to this place for breakfast. It was pretty busy and had a little bit of a wait. 
As you walk through to be seated you can see everyone's plates that are huge with massive amounts of food. 
We ordered the eggs Benedict. It was at least 8"" tall eight tons of food. Can be easily split between two people. 
Others in our group ordered the skillets which they could not finish. 
It was a fun and unique experience and I'm glad we ventured out to this place for brunch."
2990,Hash House A Go Go,5,SUPER BIG PORTIONS.  never saw anything like it. First the wait.... super long like 45 minutes and on a monday..  Got seated and had a very nice waitress. Ordered meatloaf hash with egg and fruit. Good food. Weighted a few pounds. My GF ordered pancake meal and the size of the pancake was almost 12 inches across. . yum. Other than the line food is worth it. THis place was on Man vs Food. there is a wall outside that shows famous people who visited the place.
2991,Hash House A Go Go,4,Really good corned beef hash and meatloaf hash.  The watermelon lemonade was also delicious (although a bit pricey).  The Bloody Mary came with a piece of bacon and toast. It could have used more flavor though. Service was very friendly.
2992,Hash House A Go Go,5,I went with family and the waitress made us feel right at home and the souvenir glass is awesome!
2993,Hash House A Go Go,3,Food was pretty good however the service was just ok. Nothing special. Drop the food off and go. Didn't ask if everything was good or if we needed anything else.
2994,Hash House A Go Go,1,"What the hell happened here??

The food used to be really good, fresh & flavorful.  I'm not sure what happened, but all of our meals were awful:(.  Dry, over-cooked and lacking flavor... tasted like they cut down on the quality of ingredients.  What a bummer!

This place was a Vegas staple for us... not anymore."
2995,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I don't really get the hype. The food was good and the portions are huge, but this was nothing amazing, particularly not worth the 90 minutes we had to wait for a table.

My biggest bone to pick was the speed of everything. 90 minutes to get in, okay, I get it. I live in Portland. I'm used to long waits for brunch. But once we sat down, about 15 minutes to get our drinks, another 10 to order, then we waited.

Almost an hour.

Then our food came. I was hot, good, and big portioned, but nothing mind blowing. Then we waited, and waited. And 20 minutes later we had our check. We put our cards in the little black folder on the edge of the table. Then we waited. About 15 minutes to pay.

All in, the experience was about two hours too long. If they paid attention to diners, the line would be shorter and I would have headed out happier."
2996,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They didn't take cards which was inconvenient because we had to pay $9.99 for the atm charge downstairs....other than that my chicken and waffles were awesome sauce!!! Chicken bartered fresh in the back , awesome syrup and flaky waffles so so good ! The leeks offered I nice unique addition!"
2997,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Found this gem for breakfast. 
1st off, get there early. I know, it's Vegas, no one does early. If you are fine waiting like an hour to get it, don't say I didn't warn you.


The portions are HUGE! The pancakes are more than plate size and I couldn't even make a dent in it. The 1st day I had the apple cinnamon, It was tasty. The husband had the blueberry lemon curd. It. was. amazing. So good. I also had the cold brew that they have on tap. So smooth and delicious. Big cup and beats the $6+ I would have paid at a Starbucks anywhere near the strip. 

Service: The 1st day when we got there, we were seated right away and our orders were taken promptly. The kitchen was behind however. My annoyance was that this was never told to us, we just heard our server telling the other tables. It would have been nice if she would have let us in on that too. We weren't in a hurry, it was just the principal. 


I would recommend this place if you are looking for a hearty breakfast for a reasonable deal, just be prepared to wait a while."
2998,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is great!  You will not be disappointed.   The place is always packed so don't wait until your starving to go and eat there, becuz you will be waiting for a table."
2999,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Greet good in huge amounts with good service and cool ambience:  Farm to Fork with an eclectic twist!

Must have:  Sage Chicken & Waffles.

Added bonus:  spicy peppered Bloody Mary bar at entrance for your enjoyment while you wait for your table to be called.

What else can be said? Great product for the price."
3000,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Really fun time here at the LINQ. After a night of gambling we worked up and appetite and headed up to the hash house. Got the chicken and waffles and some amazing gin blueberry drink, I was so satisfied I ended up buying a glass to take home with me. My brother got a BLT with like 10 strips of bacon it was amazing. Got a lifetime patron here"
3001,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Service was amazing, the food was really good and the portion sizes were bigger than my head! Definitely split your meal with someone if you eat a normal amount of food. Only downside was it took an hour to be seated."
3002,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Incredible large portions of food? Sure, let's try! I was told by many people if we haven't been to Hash House, we need to go at least once. Located in the Linq Hotel on the strip, we came on a Saturday morning for brunch around 10 am and it was packed. Packed means it must be a good sign! We were given ticket numbers and put our names down. The wait was around 45 minutes to an hour so we decided to go downstairs and walk around. Once our name was called, we checked into the front where they led us to a small waiting area to be seated. 

Menu consists of many different items such as chicken and waffles, scrambles, sandwiches, and more. We knew for sure we wanted the fried chicken and waffles since this is one of their well known dishes that was on the Food Network. We ordered the chicken and waffles and a smoked salmon scramble. Beware.... When you order please keep in mind that the entrees are served in HUGE portions. It's big enough to share so keep that mind if you're with a party of multiple people.

When we got our food, our faces were literally like O_O. We should have just ordered on entrÃ©e to split between us two. The chicken and waffles are two big pieces of chicken breast and four waffles stacked upon each other held by a large knife. The salmon scramble wasn't much of a shocker however it was still a large portion compared to a normal breakfast. The chicken and waffles were a once in a lifetime experience and not something I could eat all the time. The fried chicken isn't your typical fried chicken because it has a strong rosemary taste and it's quite oily. However it was good to try something different. The waffles have strips of maple bacon as well. I really enjoyed the salmon scramble except I wished there was more pesto like how the waiter described the dish. There was a huge serving of smoked salmon so that couldn't be beat. 

Overall, it was good. Was it memorable? Yes. Was it worth the wait? Yes. Would I make it a must go to in Vegas? Not really. If you never been, I recommend going once to have the experience. Next time I would go in a bigger group and split between different entrees so we can at least try different items. Prices can be steep especially when ordering drinks however it'll be enough to feed you for two to three meals. At least we were finally able to try Hash House!"
3003,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This place is so horrible! I just left there a few mins ago. The wait staff was horrible, so disorganized, their lack of attention to detail was abysmal. One lady came and put our names on a list just like the others who were waiting in the waiting area. A couple walks in and they were about to be seated before us until I walked up to the wait staff and had to tell them about themselves. Needless to say, that left a bad taste in my mouth and we left. What a waste of an Uber ride and our time. If I could give them zero stars I would! Don't waste your time going here!!"
3004,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place was horrible. Bad service, long waits for food & service, bland food. Barely saw the staff.....

Yes, the food is HUGE portions but everything is practically tasteless & bland! The biscuits that everything come with are horrible & taste more like flour than anything else. Very, very dry.

I got the smoked salmon/potato hash & it was OK. The potatos were burnt & greasy. I ended up just picking out the salmon. The boyfriend got the sage chicken & said it was incredibly dry.

Won't return unless it's 2am... not worth the wait from 10am-2pm."
3005,Hash House A Go Go,4,"As we entered the dining area to be seated, I was in awe looking at people's plates. Many of them couldn't help but just stare at was was sitting right in front of their face. The portions here are HUGE! I watched plate after plate be carried away with not even a dent put into it. I thought about how there are so many starving kids/people are in this world (sorry to be a downer, but this is just a heads up!) and I immediately told my husband.. WE ARE SHARING! Thank goodness we did! Lol We ordered the Andy's fried chicken Benedict. The fried chicken was bomb.com!! So flavorful and crispy! The bacon was thick, the mash potatoes were season perfectly, the biscuits weren't as fluffy and soft as I liked, and the hollandaise sauce with mozzarella was killer! I think because of the mountain of food that was on the plate, it was merely lukewarm. My plate wasn't sizzling. However, the taste, and the creativity was great! Plenty of reviews here to help decided rather to eat here or not.. I'd say, YES! This place is a go.. But be sure to SHARE your order.. Don't be wasteful people!! lol ENJOY!!"
3006,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG I could eat here every day.  No way will you finish all the food on your plate.  The portions are huge, so you should consider sharing a meal.  I had the corned beef hash both times.  So.much.food and it was delicious.  Five stars and two thumbs up no matter how long you have to wait."
3007,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food is good, BIG portions.  Not the best service.  Be ready to wait for at lest an hour during lunch time.  Better if you go after 2:00pm, less people."
3008,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is amazing! We ate here twice for breakfast during our short vegas stay. Eat at the bar for a comedy show
3009,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is a place you would go if you are as hungry as a lion that hasn't eaten in three years (but is somehow still alive). Based on what I was told, and my overall experience, this is a place where quantity trumps quality. Don't get me wrong, the food by itself is solid, but the portions are Texas-sized. Chicken and waffles for instance... don't let the photos fool you, this is quite literally a man vs. food sized portion. I had ordered this, not knowing I would be brought a plate that was likely the same size of my head. 

Alright, enough about quantity, lets talk quality! Both the chicken and waffles were okay. The waffles were a basic batter made with a basic square-shaped waffle iron. Cooked well, although just a touch more softness on the inside would not have hurt. Then there's the chicken. These are just three or four large pieces of battered and fried chicken. The batter was quite flavorful, but this was the only thing that shone. The chicken wasn't tough, but could have been a little more tender. Meanwhile, I feel if they had put more herbs and spices into the batter as opposed to using them for decorative purposes, the dish would not be hurt.

The dish itself looks cool at first, but then becomes quite messy. Having been brought a mountain, once you dig in, expect some sort of avalanche. Also, what's with the two/three tiny pieces of bacon and cherry tomatoes? These seemed to be added almost as an afterthought.

The service was quite nice, and food came out fairly fast. 

The prices were on-par with what you would typically find in Las Vegas in light of the portion size. If I had the capacity to eat the whole thing (could only finish half), this would be a pretty solid deal. Be mindful, unless you can eat a Man vs. Food sized portion, bring a friend or two, and split this dish with them... the value then would be spectacular!"
3010,Hash House A Go Go,5,Finally got a chance to try this place out!! We were A party of eight but we were lucky that it only took about 15 minutes to be seated. I had a vanilla latte that was amazing  and a bloody mary  to die for. Food wise we tried the chicken waffles ummm there's bacon inside the waffles amazing. Sausage gravy and biscuits were so good.. overall this is one of the best places I've been in a while!  Also There are open 24hrs... its inside the Linq ..
3011,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food is OK, but you get a ton of it. Ordered a pancake and a espresso, and the pancake was twice the size if a dinner plate."
3012,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place.

But so does everyone else. There's always a line. If you're in the Las Vegas location, hope you have a diamond card from total rewards, you get to skip the line! 

Anyway, if you can't find something on the menu to your liking, something is wrong with you. Haha.

Southern fried chicken Benedict, the chicken and waffles. the hashes, the meatloaf. ALL OF IT IS GOOD!

The portions were made for 3 people or something. I would say share the dish you order with someone in order to finish one plate, but then you won't get to see all the dishes! Nevermind, everyone order their own, and share from there. But you will have leftovers!"
3013,Hash House A Go Go,1,They had 1 vegetarian option.  I decided to get the huevos rancheros with  no meat and it was a straight up joke.  There were all these twigs sticking out of it.  (I am assuming to make it look fancy)  There was springs of rosemary randomly stuck in it.  It was a big mess.  I barely ate anything  off of it because I was too busy trying to determine what I could and what I couldn't eat.
3014,Hash House A Go Go,3,"American obesity at its most shameless!
Don't get me wrong, it's tasty. Pile fried chicken and scrambled eggs and biscuits and gravy and bacon AND CHEESE on mashed potatoes, and it's gonna taste good.

Same with bananas and brown sugar in a pancake.

The portions are HUGE and the prices are low (by major city standards), so it's easy to understand why people like it here.

I gave 3 stars for 2 reasons, neither of which having to do with taste:

1) the location is depressing. It's dark and crammed at the top of an escalator in the Quad (former Imperial Palace), and has zero ambiance. Not that one would expect romance, but it's really just sad and weird and ugly.

There's no bathroom in the restaurant (or so I was told by the hostess), so if the feeling strikes you, prepare for another trip back down the escalator and into the casino.

2) it's like, socially irresponsible to serve portions that large."
3015,Hash House A Go Go,5,THE BEST RESTAURANT IN VEGAS try to go early or you will wait a long time but it is so worth it if you can't make it early the portions are huge so I suggest you share my two favorite plates are the biscuits and gravy with egg and fried chicken mixed in and the chorizo hash the service is always awesome  this restaurant is always a must eat every time I come to vegas
3016,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Do not enter unless you are super hungry . This place has a cool vibe as soon as you walk in. The decor is fabulous. Portion sizes are massive and the menu for dinner is fantastic. Tiffany looked after us and she was super friendly. My husband ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs which came with carrots, beans and amazing wasabi mashed potatoes whilst I opted for something lighter and had the warm spinach salad.  The food came out within minutes. The ribs had an Asian flavour to them which was complimented by the wasabi mash. The spinach salad was extremely fresh, dressed with a tasty zingy balsamic fusion.  I'm going again today to check out the breakfast menu with room in my belly."
3017,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My mom, brother and I chose hash house on a whim because we were hungry but wanted more than the pizza or hotdogs that we've been eating traveling all day yesterday. We were throughly impressed with the selection available and prices and even more so with the food!! I ordered the meatloaf sandwhich (I can't remember the actual name on the menu) and my mom & brother chose to split the corned beef hash. We loved our choices!!! Definitely recommend splitting! Huge portions!!"
3018,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I went here because I fell in love the photos of Chicken&Waffle here--and I stayed at the LINQ. This place was very crowded at 10am, so my boyfriend and I waited about 30 mins to get seats. The menu is humongous. I ordered Chicken&Waffle ($20), and he ordered Fried Chicken (comes with 2 eggs, 2 bacons, mashed potato, a biscuit, gravy/jam, and fruits--it's massive. $15). The portion is soooo generous compare to the price you pay! And the presentation of food is nice. The thing is the food is so big, you really feel like you are in America (this applies to visitors from foreign countries LOL). The food was delicious, yet too much to finish by myself, so I took some to-go. 

This was a delightful experience before we left Las Vegas! Must try for brunch!"
3019,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The drinks were WAY overpriced, it was over $7 for a well margarita.  The food wasn't that great.  It only took 5 minutes to get our food, and it should take 7 minutes to cook our chicken.  Obviously it was precooked, and it tasted like it."
3020,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge proportions, we shared. Loved the watermalen kiwi lemonade and the banana latte. For the main entree got the quisadilla. Awesome food, awesome service and awesome atmosphere."
3021,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When we saw people getting their orders we were in AWWE. Are you kidding me? Watermelon lemonade yum. Banana Latte- YUM. But most of all, the giant pile of sage chicken and waffles? Friggen rediculous. 

TRUST ME You have to try this place next time you are in Vegas. 

The wait was 35 minutes, but you can order a bloody mary or lemonade while you wait. 

Grab your hotel coupon book they usually have coupons for a free lemonade. We will be back, my daughter and I were crazy about this place. 

Food: YUMMMM
Service: GREAT
Wait: LOOOONG so be prepared to wait. Or take turns waiting and go gamble:)"
3022,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After the Cher concert we walked over to the Imperial Palace starving and decided to try this place out:
First off, the service in a word - Sucked!! There were no smiles well of course if you count the 17yr old bus boy flirting with me... It took forever for our waitress to take our order and just as long for her to bring us our drinks. For about 8 minutes there were actually no employees to be seen out on the floor, all us customers were just looking around hoping an employee appears...
The place is alot smaller than what I thought it would be, anyhow  we thought the food was good. On the table was the cheeseburger,chicken sandwich,grilled chicken breast over mashed potatoes, polenta & w/grilled carrots (I LOVE CARROTS!!!), and the crab cakes with potatoes & veggies. STUFFED seems to be the trend in this restaurant cause thats what we were. 
I didn't care for the biscuits everyone seems to love....I like dinner rolls better than biscuits anyways...
All in all I would try this place again most likely in the other location and I will only go if I am terribly hungry...."
3023,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place had some pretty good breakfast. I got chicken and waffles. That waffle is cooked to perfect it's soft but has this light airy crisp to it . The chicken were strips and then I even had a drink with it. The drink was okay but I'm not much a drinker so it could actually be really good . Loved the sugar on the rim.
3024,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food Portions are outrageous my wife and I split a breakfast and there was still a lot of leftovers. Go their hungry and don't be afraid to share a meal. The breakfast are classic american favorites with a twist. Taste was great.
3025,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Loved it ! Awesome place, portions were huge (which is their selling point) and awesome service. The wait is usually 30-hour wait but they have free wifi so the wait flies by. Just don't go in there super hungry."
3026,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had breakfast here about two hours ago. Still full as all hell. Your server will tell you, as will the menu, that the food takes a while to cook. They aren't kidding. I went in hungry, and was ready to bite off some heads by the time the food was brought to our table. No worries, they were very attentive along the way in updating us on the status of their clearly heavily-burdened kitchen and bar staff. Service is top notch, atmosphere is very laid back (I had dress shoes on and felt a little bit douche-ily overdressed). 

Portions were very very large. This is not the kind of place where you order more than one entree ""just to try"" different things. Get one plate per person, expect to share and still have leftovers. One thing I noticed is that everything was very light on the salt. Some might appreciate that, but I prefer everything salty. Salt is as essential to a man as testosterone. I found myself slathering everything in salt and Tabasco, but everything was quite tasty after that.

All in all, a good place I wouldn't mind coming back to, but not quite four stars."
3027,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Seriously wonderful. If you haven't ever been to Hash House you need to. Everything is completely yummy and consistent from table to table and meal to meal. HUGE serving sizes so sharing a plate is plenty for two people. The location at the Linq was really busy, as expected for such a good eatery, but we were seated quickly. My boyfriend and I split the chicken and waffles and a blueberry pancake. Hindsight, way too much food for two people but so worth it. Don't question it, just go!"
3028,Hash House A Go Go,5,Nothing but amazing things to say about this place. Totally lived up to the hype. My mom got the chicken with the maple reduction and it was absolutely exquisite and what I'm ordering the next time I'm in town. Great service as well!
3029,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best food in Vegas. Not that pricy when you consider the giant portions. Breakfast and lunch food has been excellent.
3030,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My go to place. Very large portions, and excellent food. Waffles? Yes please! And it sits well when you're drunk! Perfect for Vegas. The price is right, and the food is great, especially if you like breakfast! You have to try the bacon inside the waffles. Mmmm"
3031,Hash House A Go Go,3,"There was so much hype in our crew leading up to Hash House A Go Go that I feel like I'm letting everybody down with such a middle-of-the-road rating.  However, allow me to explain (and yes, you know I will).

Last weekend HHAGG was one of our premier destinations, meaning, we absolutely HAD to get there no matter what it took.  We arrived at Imperial Palace around 10:30ish and figured we'd have to wait a while, so we put our name in and headed back downstairs to gamble.  Adorably handsome Host Guy told us it would take about 1-1.5 hours, so we figured if we came back around 11-1115, we'd be alright since the little buzzer things don't work in the casino proper.

Multiple drinks and gaming experiences later, we head back around 1115 only to discover that our names had been called already.  One of the other hostesses asked us to wait in an alcove closer to the actual restaurant itself, and while we were blocking it, we waited another 20 or so minutes.  By then we'd pored over the menus and made consensuses as to what we'd order.  The host desk seemed to keep forgetting us, though, so there was a number of ""reminding"" requests on our behalf.

We were seated and ordered our drinks -- I opted for the Bloody Maria, which was absolutely delicious, my bro ordered a Milwaukee's Best Premium for the novelty of it, and everybody else ordered regular stuff -- and off we were.

The food takes a looong time.  Don't come here starving (or super drunk as I was).  You'll see other patrons getting their food and your mood will just continuously sour.  No matter how upbeat you keep the conversation, eventually it will lull and you'll realize the food takes foreeeever.

Once our plates came out, they arrived at various times.  Snoop Melly Mel started on her Tractor's Platter with french toast and devoured it.  My bro Alvin D. opted for blueberry pecan pancakes, Alex A. chose the chorizo hash, and the bestie and I split the sage fried chicken and waffles and the crispy pork tenderloin benedict.

Now here's the catch -- the portions are well priced and definitely large.  Don't get me wrong.  But there were just small things here and there, particularly with the ""popular"" and more ""signature"" platters the bestie and I ordered.  The fried chicken is tasty but entirely too dry, as is the waffle.  The waffle is WAY too doughy and thick.  The bbq cream sauce on top of the pork tenderloin benedict is to DIE for, as is the well breaded and well seasoned meat itself.  The biscuit also is amazing.  But everything else on the platter somewhat faltered; somewhere underneath there lays spinach, tomato slices, and mashed potatoes that were essentially tasteless.

The best part of the plates was also the most skimped on -- come on, maple reduction?  You can afford to offer more of that than just a mere drizzle on the sides of each plate.  It was delicious, but SO scant, that we barely got to enjoy it.

Our server was kind, attentive and accurate enough, but bringing out each order seemed kind of scattered.  As per the usual, others bring out the food, but they never seemed sure as to which table their orders in hand belonged.  What's up with that?

HHAGG was definitely worth the first-time experience, even with the table mix-up.  But would I return?  Probably not to this one; I would maybe opt for the one at the M Resort just to save time.  A solid A-OK."
3032,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Visited this place during Rock in Rio weekend because a couple of us wanted to try it for brunch. We were NOT disappointed! The portions were HUGE! The 6 of us shared 3 dishes and it was plenty. I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and not only was it huge...it was delicious! Fried chicken on top of a massive mound of biscuits and gravy, all smothered in their own sauce, Don't go for it if you're on some kind of strict diet, but if you're looking for something that you can share and still fill up on, by all means get the Fried Chicken benedict, or any of their other benedicts. 

I also got their House Special Bloody Mary, which definitely had a kick to it! Bloody Marys have a special taste to them, so if you're not sure you like Bloody Marys in general, maybe they aren't for you. But if you know you do like them, then this place does it well! 

The service was great, also. Our waitress was always within earshot and made sure we were doing okay. One of my friends' orders was wrong (she got sunny side up eggs, but she wanted scrambled) and was instantly given a new plate of scrambled eggs, and she also got to keep her old plate, so that was great! More food!

The only reason this place lost one star was the long wait, which was even longer because they called our name way before their predicted time. They told us about 1.5 hours, so we took a walk for an hour, and came back to find out that we were no longer on the list. Partly our fault, but maybe they can implement a more efficient system. Not too big of a deal. 

Anyways, will definitely try to come to another Hash House around my neighborhood and see if it's just as good!"
3033,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Okay another hungover morning, wait I mean another still drunk from last night morning, and im starving,with no energy to battle through a buffet me and my friend decided to hit the Hashhouse, since I kept hearing about these chicken and waffles, It was bookmarked!

we got there and got seated right away place wasn't to full yet, I ordered some kind of spritzer cocktail, it was tasty, my friend ordered some kinda Mojito champagne thing, she didn't like it but I did, because im a lush.
I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles which comes with,
two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks.

This thing was huge as you can see from the pic, I thought the bacon cooked into the waffle was G, the leeks where all over it, and there was a little bit of diced Bellperes around the whole plate, the presentation was on point. I was surprised how much the flavors all balanced out together, I thought the leeks, & bell pepper would throw it off, but every bit of it all magically went together. My friend Lanz had one of the house hashes the Chorizo, jalapenos, cheddar cheese & fresh tomato.
This comes with tossed  crispy potatoes and is topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit. 
T
his was really really good, and i thought it was gonna be super meh, no way this tasted better than most Mexican spots in LA that serve Chorizo breakfast style, with that said my friend was too out of it to eat it all, so I took the pleasures. This will be my breakfast of drunken champions spot from now on when I do Vegas, or rather when Vegas does me?"
3034,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One word....fabulous!!!!  The food, the ambiance, the server Luisa - she is bubbly, pretty & extremely attentive, the coffee, the food coma.   I need to run now to work off what I ate.  The sage chicken is a masterpiece.  U must try it.   We asked for take out containers since we are staying at an AirBnB and a microwave.  U must make this a stop in your LV trip.  Bon apetit!!!"
3035,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is pretty good.

Yeah its located inside the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino but don't let that fool you. Once you enter this restaurant, you wouldn't even remember you were at the IP.

The portions were big enough to share between two people. We got the Hash House Meatloaf and Pasta and a side of Roasted Potatoes. BOTH WERE DELICIOUS!!!!! ]

Other reviews complained about the long wait...although it wasn't as fast as Denny's of BJ's, the wait wasn't too bad...it was like a 20min wait for the food to arrive at the table. You're in VEGAS!!!!!! ENJOY IT!!!! Have a nice relaxing dinner...you're in the city of hustle and bustle all day long...rest up and enjoy the food!

I would definitely come back to this place if I have a chance."
3036,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hubby had sage chicken and waffles..awesome presentation.  I had caramel, banana, pecan french toast with mashed hash browns(omg), and scram eggs.  THE OJ was sooooo good!  Service was great and it filled our bellies! We will be back!"
3037,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Big portions that just can't be finished by us city folk. Maybe if I were fed on a farm growing up, raised by trough-like portions.. And I caught a sight of those burgers they offer.. 

So bring a friend! Don't eat alone! We got two of their hashes, the meatloaf and the roast chicken. Meatloaf was the clear winner in this one; everything was moist and tasty, and I looooved the cheese. The roast chicken wanted to be tasty, but came out dry, yet with crispy potatoes! :) The Warm Spinach Salad was also a yummy surprise. So it was a good breakfast for lunch kinda situation and we were FULL. Ready for a day on the strip! After all, breakfast is the most important meal!"
3038,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food, big portions, and great service! The chicken and waffles are amazing! Coffee is delicious!"
3039,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ate at the Hash House because it was near our hotel (Harrahs) and it didn't disappoint. We are here for dinner and had the BBLT (they like their bacon) and the spaghetti and meatballs. A lot of people order the chicken and waffles, which also looked good but plan to split as the portions were huge. We really enjoyed our meal and the service was good. Only downfall is there is no ""vegas"" feel. Would definitely eat here again!"
3040,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After a much needed, long overdue night of letting go, this place was a godsend-at least for the food. My friend ordered the hash, and it was absolutely FANTASTIC! I had the ""basic"" (eggs, bacon, potatoes) and everything was cooked perfectly. The only downy was the service. It took way too long at 3am to get our food when the place was almost empty."
3041,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is the one good thing that the Imperial Palace still has going for it.

My husband ordered his usual of two eggs, home fries, and he added french toast to his order as well. I got the vanilla waffles and a side of bacon. The only negative I have is that they used thin-cut bacon and could totally afford to use thick considering the prices they charge. The waffle was gigantic, I only managed 1 1/2 squares before I had to give up. I felt a little bad because the waitress even noticed that the one tiny cup of syrup was not enough and brought out a bunch more, which I poured all over my waffles and then ended up not finishing. Oh well! I want to go back and try the Sage Friend Chicken and Waffles, but I need to have people with me who eat meat and can share as the portion size is HUGE. 

If you don't like loud music and conversation, DON'T GO HERE. That's just how it is, and complaining about it isn't going to change a thing. If you go to a restaurant and expect the ambiance, temperature, and other patrons to revolve around you, then I suggest you just open your own damn restaurant. There might be a wait, especially on weekends, but they give you a pager that has quite a range so you can go into the casino and play slots or do whatever while you wait for your table. It only took about 15-20 minutes for us to get seated. DEFINITELY worth the wait."
3042,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I came here on a recommendation and what a great recommendation it was!

The food here is spectacular and the portion sizes are humongous! My husband got the chicken and waffles and he loved it! I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (as seen on Man vs. Food) and oh my goodness, it was out of this world amazang! We also got Watermelon lemonades which were delicious! The lemonades had so much more flavor than we anticipated and they weren't too too sweet. Definitely try one if you go!

The service was excellent. The waiters are very casual, talkative and friendly, making the experience very laid back and relaxed. The restaurant was well kept and all the dishes were spotless. Gotta love a super clean restaurant! 

The ambiance is relaxed, like I said, casual dining. There are pictures of celebrities that have visited Hash House A Go Go around the entrance, which is really cool to see.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is going to Vegas and I would definitely go back as well."
3043,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Must do while in Las Vegas. The wait is just killer. No matter what time you go, you're going to have to wait at least 45 mins. Chicken and Waffles is excellent!"
3044,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We had a heck of an adventure finding this place. The Imperial PALACE (ahem) is the most confusing place I've been to yet! We got lost a few times, went up and down a few creepy elevators, and eventually found this place. Wait time was about 30 minutes, bearable with the right people and bloody marys. 

Food is good, more appealing in presentation and size. The waffle was delicious, fried chicken with sage was flavorful. I could have probably done without the hash and quesadilla but I was glad to try it. I recommend one order to share between two people. The portions are HUGE and I love it!!"
3045,Hash House A Go Go,2,"It's an o.k place, our selections of scrambles/ hash were plain and flavorless despite the gigantic portions and extra cheesiness."
3046,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'll make it simple. 10:00 on a Saturday morning for 3 of us. Had flapjacks, egg scramble, potatoes, bacon, orange juice, biscuit. 

PROS:
- Large portions
- Fresh juice and food

CONS:
- Long wait to be seated
- Hot
- Loud
- Long wait for food
- Food is slightly above average
- Did I mention it was loud?

Would have given less stars if food was worse. 

Overall: I would not go there again. It is not worth the wait and shouting over one another."
3047,Hash House A Go Go,1,I really used to like this restaurant when they had one location.  Food is bland and too commercialized.  Its really a tourist type place now.
3048,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First time here, it was alright. I ordered the corned beef hash with a sunny side up egg. It's not your traditional breakfast corned beef hash so if that's what you're wanting don't order this dish. The potatoes were bland & dry so I mainly ate the egg & corned beef.

My husband ordered the basic 2 egg breakfast which he seemed to like. My brother ordered the apple cinnamon flapjack. The pancake is really huge, beware the portions are really big so it's really enough to share a plate per couple.

I didn't think the food was worth the price but to each their own."
3049,Hash House A Go Go,4,"TLDR; Was hard to find, dinner menu was hardly different than brunch menu, nice and friendly staff, good/a little above average food, better presentation. Huge portions.

A little hard to find, you go up a narrow escalator to it. 
It was not busy at all and we came in around 3pm/ 25 mins till dinner menu.
Waitress was very nice. My bf and I admired the staffs gauges and tattoos.
I thought the brunch menu looked great. I wanted something eggy but my bf wanted ""food food"" and wanted a burger. I wasn't in the mood for the burger so I was eyeing the crispy pork sandwich, somehow thinking it was going to be like pulled pork, I dunno what was going on in my mind xD
He tells the waitress he is interested in the dinner menu, and she tells him that the dinner menu starts in 25 mins and asked him if he wanted to wait. She comes back with the dinner menu so we can decide if we want the Brunch or Dinner menu and there is hardly a difference. He then tells her nevermind, he'll have something from the brunch menu and he ordered the burger with the bacon and mash potatoes.
I got the crispy pork AND HOLYS*** it was HUGE. I ended up just cutting off the extra meat, ate that, and saved the burger for dinner(their portions are huge btw.) My bf also didn't finish his burger and let me have a taste, and the bun was very very good (mine had grains and stuff on it, his was glossy).

I'd say his meal reminded me of something drunk people would want to eat, and mine reminded me of tempura. He got soda while I got the fresh-squeezed tangerine juice. I wouldn't get it again, as it wasn't too flavorful (was not watery, just needed sugar :c)
The food was above average and had beautiful presentation. 

For 2 people we spent $44."
3050,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow...  the food is fantastic.   Huge portions so definitely bring a friend and split your meal.  We had the Sage Chicken ....  I'm loving it. Will be back again. Highly recommend this place
3051,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They had a wait list but the line moved pretty quickly.  It's a huge restaurant - and the staff is really efficient.  We felt rushed to order at first, then when we made up our minds our server was nowhere in sight.  After she came back things moved at a good pace.
The portions are really big and so good that I had to stop myself from eating everything.  I had the steak, asparagus, tomato and cheese scramble that came with potatoes that were a little dry, fruit, and a wonderful biscuit and homemade strawberry jelly.  It was so good!
I'd love to go back and try the lunch/dinner items because they all looked so good.
The prices are a little higher than you'd expect for this kind of food ($10 for a grilled cheese sandwich) - but the portions are large and it is Vegas."
3052,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Service was horrible. Food was good.

Arrived at Hash House at the Linq and asked for a table for 4 and waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning. Typical wait time since it is a busy place. We sat down and ordered our food and when the waiter left, I looked at my watch to see that it was about 9:00am. We saw about two other tables get seated maybe 10-15 minutes after us with the same amount of people. About 30-40 minutes later, we saw that the other two tables who got seated after us got served their food before us. It was about the same type of food (eggs benedict) that we ordered at our table so we knew the type of food we ordered wasn't taking longer than others. We kept trying to flag our waiter down and he would quickly come by and say, ""Your food will be out shortly"" but wouldn't let us get a word in and leave the table right away. He did this several times. A friend and I went to the manager at about 9:45 and told him the situation. The manager replied back, ""So are you going to eat your food or leave?"" He didn't even apologize or say he'll go check on the food first but instead just asked if we were gonna leave like he didn't care.  Finally, our food came out 10 minutes later and we waited for the manager to come back before eating the food. He told us that he will give us 25% off and sorry for the delay but that they are always busy on Saturday mornings. The waiter came by shortly afterwards and said that he put the order in right after we ordered at 9:15am and said that it wasn't his fault that the food came out late. Basically, both the manager and waiter did not care and just blamed it on the busy morning even though two tables got served before we did. 

The food was good but I lost my appetite. The portions can feed 2-3 people."
3053,Hash House A Go Go,5,Everything you read is true about both the portion sizes and the uniqueness of the food.  Went in mid-February on a trip to Vegas for about the 'umpteeenth' time and it just doesn't ever get old!!  Went for dinner on this trip with a group of friends and everyone ordered different items to share.  It was great to get to try a few things that I wouldn't order myself and not focus on dinner/lunch food .  A couple of 'surprises' that stood out to me: spaghetti and meatballs; butternut squash and the skillet chicken.   Strawberry shortcake dessert was great as was the new chocolate waffle dessert.  Always new and innovative stuff at Hash House A Go Go!!
3054,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait was about 30 mins, however the portion size of the food was worth it! The man vs food item was crazy good! It has a little spice to it, but it wasn't too spicy. You can easily share this with someone. My husband had the pancakes that were also HUGE! Make sure you show up with an appetite."
3055,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent service. Great food, good cup of coffee and the best damn Bloody Mary in Las Vegas!

I enjoy eating here every time I'm in Vegas. My husband loves the Fried Chicken and Waffle breakfast and my favorite is the Chorizo Hash and the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits.  Be warned: these PORTIONS ARE HUGE! You could easily share a meal, and because they have so many tasty options on the menu you could order several and share them so you can try a few dishes at a time. 

The fried chicken dinner and waffle meal comes with large, crispy, juicy chicken breasts and a hot belgian style waffle. The hash is served with home fries, eggs your way and chorizo-spicy but so good.  

The bloody mary is a perfect combination of all ingredients-not to tomatoey, with just enough citrus and heat to give your taste buds a kick and vodka to get 'cha mind right for a long, fun day in Vegas, lol.

The atmosphere is casual and fun, especially since they relocated from the M Resort to The Linq. It seems bigger, has a larger waiting area and bar inside, tvs all around in case there's a game on and they also have a great Bloody Mary bar at the entrance which I especially love. 

This is definitely someplace you should go eat if you're visiting Las Vegas at least once.  

I'm sure it'll become one of your favorites!"
3056,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Been here a couple of times. The first time I ordered the fried chicken salad and it was really good, only I felt bad that there was so much food and I barely made a dent in my plate. The salad could easily feed a starving family. 
This last time I opted for the breakfast scramble, 3 jumbo eggs with cheese, avocado, onion accompanied with house potatoes and a jumbo rosemary biscuit. I thought my breakfast was just okay, the avocado in my scramble was oxidized and mushy so I wasn't too pleased with that. The eggs were not cooked as well as I would have liked them.  Again, the plate was huge and I didn't finish it, I'm sure 2 hungry adults could have shared this breakfast.
The wait wasn't too long, we only waited 20 minutes to be seated. The dining room is fairly huge so they can get you in and out. Service was nothing spectacular, just people working to work. The drinks are expensive here. For my breakfast and a mimosa I payed about $20-$25."
3057,Hash House A Go Go,2,"After our $60 breakfast here I can safely say this place isn't worth the hype!

When we arrived at 9:30AM there was no wait. When we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. Let me tell you, I would have been PISSED if I had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!

Drinks - I ordered a Watermelon Lemonade and BF ordered a Pistachio Iced Mocha. The drinks were awesome! Mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. His Pistachio Mocha was sooo good! I was mad that I didn't order it. 

For breakfast both my BF and my BFF ordered the Tractor Driver Combo which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or french toast for one extra dollar. BFF got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and BF got the Vanilla Waffle. 

Their eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. His waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.

My order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? This is what happened to me. 

I ordered the HH Original Benedict. Eggs Benedict - I expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. Whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things I need. I read that I would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of mashed potatoes, although I didn't know how that would fit in. I read about the red pepper cream, but I thought that would be along with my hollandaise. I read basted eggs, and I honestly didn't know what that meant. 

So I received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. I get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.

The taste? Eh. The top layers are alright. The basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. The bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry mashed potatoes. Not a good combo. They really have no business calling this any sort of benedict since they strayed away from every traditional benedict characteristic possible, aside from stacking everything on top of each other.

There are many better places to drop $60 on breakfast at in Vegas - this is not one I would revisit. Also, apparently there was an episode of Man vs Food filmed here? That must be their claim to fame because our waiter mentioned it at least 5 times. Wow, I am so impressed."
3058,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My second visit to a HHAGG the first being in Orlando.  As it was in Orlando, the LV location did not disappoint.  I'm a bit of a corned beef hash snob.  I like a traditional hash.  The HHAGG is not traditional with all the hashiness mixed together and made crusty on a griddle.  That was okay with me.  Still delicious.  The standard bloody mary was pretty big and did its duty well in smoothing out the rougher edges that can often occur in Las Vegas in the morning...or the afternoon depending on when one calls it a day.  I did not have the big mary special.

As a solo diner, I sat at the bar and was welcomed with excellent service.  Be advised of you sit at the bar they want a card upon ordering.  No big thing for me.

I might just go back tomorrow morning.

For the HHAGG rookies, the portions are big.  That's their signature.  If you have a few people, consider sharing family style to be able to sample the many worthy offerings."
3059,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is outstanding!

The service is great, the ambiance is even better, and the food is second to none!

When I arrived at the Hash House A Go Go, I was immediately greeted by two women who promptly took down my name, asked about  my party size, and told me it would be a 15-20 minute wait (which ended up being a 10 minute wait). SCORE!

Once my party was seated (party of 2), our server came by and took our drink order. We embarked in casual conversation, while also listening to his recommendations on whats popular at the restaurant! Our server was outstanding! His food knowledge was great, and he really made our stay that much more enjoyable. He checked on us very often, always refilled our drinks without us having to ask, and always had a smile on his face. The service here is what makes The Hash House A Go Go standout from other restaurants on the strip, alongside their humongous food portions. 

I ended up ordering the Fried Chicken Benedict (as seen on Man V. Food) and let me say, its as amazing as everyone says it is! The portions are enough for three people, and considering this was my first time here, I attempted to finish the whole dish myself, which resulted in a fail.
My guest had the Banana Pecan French Toast, and let me tell you, these were the best french toast's I've ever had!

Both items were bursting with flavor, and made your taste buds dance! 

I would highly advise you to check this place out, you will not be disappointed! 

The Hash House plays great music, and they have a great restaurant layout. Pictures of famous people fill the walls, adding to the decor ambiance of the restaurant. 

The restaurant is inside the Plaza, and its worth the walk/drive!

If this is your first time here, my recommendation is either the Fried Chicken Benedict (if you want something more lunch related) or the Banana Pecan French Toast, (if you want something more breakfast/brunch related)

The pricing is amazing, considering the HUGE portions you get. (again all the dishes could be split for two people, it'll save you some bucks)

I ended up paying 31 dollars for two plates and some drinks, not bad!

The Hash House does not disappoint, and the food will leave you wanting more!"
3060,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great comfort food....Bring the appetitie...because the biscuits are so yummy with the honey butter....man I almost got full on those...Childrens hamburger with fries humongous and very tasty...Chicken Salad...Waffles and Chicken... Sage Fried Chicken...It was all so good...Customer service was very good when we had gone and they were very attentive.  I'll be back...
3061,Hash House A Go Go,3,"In Vegas, wherever you can find cheap and large portion places is filled with people. we arrived this breakfast place on a Saturday noon around 11am, and the wait line is about 1 hour and 15 min long for two people. Well, I guess people here have nothing else to do, so the wait is tolerable. 

Since there is no where else you can find easy meal, we decided to wait. The restaurant is actually pretty big. A lot of people. Serve is fast though. The food took about 20-25 min to arrive, so that part was not too bad. But the food itself was not that great.

We had a mojito, which was pretty strong and tasty. The food indeed came in huge portion, but the taste wasn't that great. We tried the french toast, which was lack much flavor except for the sweetness from the syrup. And my omelette with mushroom was very plain as well. Not taste of the egg. And the potato on the side was not crispy and not so great. The only highlight was their homemade strawberry jam and whipped butter. Those help the plain food to be more tasty.

This is Vegas. Line up for the not so great food only for the big portion and cheap price."
3062,Hash House A Go Go,5,"EPIC!!! Every city, every time, the food is just epic!!  Everything tastes epic. Portions are epic. Coffee is epic. Just go enjoy and epic mean!"
3063,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fat kid heaven. My husband got some mountain of meat, eggs, potatoes and gravy. I can't remember what I got, but I think it was the slightly tamer version of his. They give you a lot of food and it is bad for you, but it is delicious.
I would most definitely go back! It was a great hangover cure too.
I am curious about their lunch menu since we saw the breakfast on TV and had to get that when we visited. I would assume they make great burgers.

You go through the Imperial Palace's casino and up the elevator to find this place. It is a bit hidden."
3064,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This restaurant is on the 2nd floor of the Imperial Palace - the idea is interesting - real big plates with real big food items - too much for someone normal to eat so lots of waste - I do not like it and had to send both orders back.  I ordered the pancake - you get one pancake for $7.00 but it is bigger than the plate - I am a pancake person and have ordered and reviewed pancakes for years still looking for the perfect one - this is not it.  It is rubbery, and tastes like nothing unless you smothered in it syrup and butter.  So sent it back and ordered the Basic which is 2 eggs any style, biscuit, potatoes and fruit also for $7.00... Ordered 2 eggs over medium with Biscuit...what came out was 2 eggs over very runny hardly even cooked and a biscuit which had no taste and was worse than the pancake.. The orange slices were good.  The service was terrible as well so not a fan....This is the first time ever I had to send both orders back - will not return - they all seemed shocked I did not like there terrible food."
3065,Hash House A Go Go,4,We had breakfast.  Initial wait wasn't bad at all.  Once we ordered took about 30 mins to get food.  Waiter was great and service was awesome.  I ordered the biscuits & gravy.  Overall good.  Came served over mashed potatoes which overwhelmed the dish.  I would have preferred more sausage gravy.  If I ordered again I would ask for no potato's.   Other order was French toast platter and was thrilled.  It was awesome.  OJ was also great! Would for sure recommend going.
3066,Hash House A Go Go,5,One of my friends kept going on about this place & she was absolutely right! It was located inside our hotel (The Linq) so the location was perfect. However there was a 45min wait at like 10am!!! I was pissed but the quality of the food & service made me understand why the wait is so long. You can get breakfast cheaper somewhere else but here you definitely get your money's worth. The portions are huge & I had leftovers for 2 more meals. I had the steak and eggs & I got to try some of my friend's chicken & waffles. Both were so delicious!
3067,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good service. .... big portions,  good taste.... cheapest meal of my entire 10 day vacation and was the best . My fiance had  chicken  and waffles and I had BBLT.... we both were pleased"
3068,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Sweet Jesus, the portions are ridiculous.  I know it seems fun to have a large amount of food set down in front of you, but for shit sake they have got to waste so much food here.  

We had a wait about 25 minutes, but that's alright.

The place was packed, but the service seemed to be decent.

The food is presented in a very attractive manner but it's just so much it makes my stomach grumble even before taking that first bite.

It's quite simply the type of meal that looks good on the plate, but makes you feel like crap afterwards.

This meal will run through your 30 feet of digestive tract faster than you can strategize how to make it to the John. 

Good luck.  Ps- This is in the Imperial Palace (not the nicest ""resort"" on the strip)."
3069,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food every time we come. Portions are big so order accordingly.  We love the cornbeef and hash.  Banana pancakes were so big and yummy.  Can't wait to try something else on the menu.
3070,Hash House A Go Go,4,Heard about the huge breakfast options at Hash House A Go Go.  It did not disappoint.  Bring an appetite or share a plate.  I would go back.
3071,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ordered the chicken and waffles and the fried chicken benedict. Portions were GIGANTIC .. could easily feed two meals worth, possibly even three. Presentation is definitely what gets me here first. Food was piled high with a huge knife in it to help everything stand up. 

Chicken and waffles: had bacon cooked inside the waffles. Couldn't really taste the bacon inside too much, but it's a cool idea. Was great tasting, huge, chicken was tasty. Would definitely recommend.

Fried chicken benedict: To my surprise, I liked this dish a bit more than the chicken and waffles. Maybe because I'm more of a savory person though. I expected something like eggs benedict with some fried chicken on the side, but I got a mountain of .. everything. Huge biscuits, two huge pieces of fried chicken, bacon, tomatoes, spinach, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs .. all covered in some sauce (can't remember what the sauce was, but it was delicious). The skin of the fried chicken stayed crunchy even through the mess of everything in the dish. Was delicious. Share the leftovers with my husband at the airport for our quick dinner on the run. (I'd say it was enough for 2.5 meals)

Service was really good as well. When we walked in, they put our name on the list and said it'd be a 1 hour 15 min wait. We were debating going to another restaurant, but totally glad we stayed. And they actually called our name only after 30 minutes. Our waitress was extremely nice and we asked for a whole bunch of things at the same time (napkins, to go bags, sauce containers, etc) and she easily remembered everything and promptly came back with everything we asked for. 

Great place to go to. They have one in Chicago too, so I believe I will be back sometime :)"
3072,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Large portion for breakfast. Traditional southern food with a slight twist. All was good but get in time when not busy. When I was done there were over 35 people waiting.
Main thing for 4 stars: they over charged my CC by $25. Had to get it corrected but correction took 10 minutes."
3073,Hash House A Go Go,1,"All of my excitement about Hash House was unwarranted. After a 45 minute wait, we ordered our food immediately because my husband had a poker tournament to make. Despite ordering right away and informing our waiter of our slight time crunch, my husband's food came in 45 minutes and mine in 55 minutes. By the time my food came, my hubby had to leave to make the tournament he signed up for... I ate my chicken and waffles alone. (To be fair, we probably should have known better than to come somewhere like this with a schedule to keep.)

In a nutshell, my problems with HH:
1) Average food. Chicken and waffles and corned beef were good but not great. Expensive for average food.
2) Poor customer service. Lots of staff running everywhere with little getting accomplished. While we were waiting, I was at the front bar to order a drink and had to interrupt a lipstick application gossip fest among the front staff to ask where the bartender had gone. Our waiter came by 3x to tell us our food was coming and it was still 15 minutes until the first dish came out. When I voiced my frustration about the wait for our food, it barely registered. No offer to make our experience better. Only a sheepish apology as our server ran off to run my credit card.

It must be nice to give terrible service and still have a crowded restaurant and celebrity guests. 

My advice, don't waste your time. Take your business somewhere that will appreciate your presence."
3074,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Party of 9, high expectations. 

The good: 
Large portions
Good coffee drinks
Chicken and waffles
Mashed potatoes

The bad:
Bloody Mary's
Eggs Benedict (Man vs Food)
Mimosa (light on champagne
Hash Special - too complicated
Price - Overpriced

The average:
Service
Ambiance 



End result - Two very rowdy bellies."
3075,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We eat here every time I get my oil changed at Lexus, which is right next door. The food is legit delicious, but the portion sizes are out of control. It almost takes away from the fact the food is high quality and inspired, and turns the experience a little gimmicky for my taste....however...if you take a friend, and agree on an entree to share (which might not be easy as the whole menu sound yummy) the portions seem more manageable and you can focus on the quality of the food, which is on point, versus the mammoth quantity."
3076,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was great! I had their popular special the chicken and waffles and their portions are huge. I could have totally shared it with someone. I also had the kiwi watermelon lemonade which was sooooo yummy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was for a reasons: one thing I didn't like how there was no refills on the drinks and if there was it cost 1$ each refill. That's pretty ridiculous if III ask me because I love my juice so I had to really savor my drink. And second the service was soooo slow. The people were really nice it just took way too long for me to get something. Like it already took us almost an hour to get seated. Then it took another 30-45 minutes just so I could get my food. And I understand it was very busy but they should have fixed something about cause even when I asked for something like butter or whatever that took like 10 minutes in itself. But food wise it is amazing I would definitely go back.
3077,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and large helpings.

Had the vegetable hash with roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, and artichoke hearts. Food was great. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals.

Some of the best hot chocolate I've had too!"
3078,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Someone suggested this little place of joy last year when I went to Vegas, and now it's a staple when I go. HUGE portions and amazing flavor. Both times I've been I get a personal fave, mushroom and Swiss burger & fries. I haven't been disappointed yet! Great great great service too. I recommend this it EVERYONE if they say they're going to Vegas."
3079,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Really a 3.5. My friends and I came after partying in Vegas. Up-side: food portions are humongous! Down side: the smoke from the casino kind makes its way upstairs and it wasn't a pleasant atmosphere (literally). We had to wait a little too long for our food, also.
 I had apple cinnamon flapjack which was the biggest flap jack I ever saw and my friends had roasted chicken hash and some kind of chicken and waffle thingy. No one finished but everyone was pleased with the food."
3080,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Most tourists decide where to eat because people rave about it on Yelp, and so did we. The food portion is huge! and the decoration is awesome, but I'd focus more on the taste.     I think what I ordered is HH original benedict, I know the waitress already told me it is different from the usual benedict because they use tomato sauce instead of hollandaise sauce and I still wanted to try. I don't know what is wrong but they just don't seem right for me. The mashed potato was tasteless and didn't go well with the only sour tomato sauce, so as the biscuit. I expected more balanced flavor from the signature dish that represents the restaurant. My brother ordered corn hash beef with scrambled egg and said it's just bland and nothing special but the size."
3081,Hash House A Go Go,3,"1868 - Japan's Emperor moved to Tokyo.  The new residence eventually becomes known as the Imperial Palace.

1945 - Allied firebombing raids destroy most of the palace and grounds.  Eventually, the Allies use an atomic bomb to end the war.

1954 - Godzilla (a direct result of atomic testing) attacks Japan, trouncing Tokyo and the Imperial Palace.  This would be the first in a series of Godzilla attacks.

1979 - The Imperial Palace opens in Las Vegas.  The Emperor clearly needed to raise funds from multiple Godzilla trouncings, so he made it into a hotel/casino.

2005 - Godzilla (working through a secret shell corporation known as ""Harrah's"" buys the Las Vegas Imperial Palace with plans to destroy it.

2009 - Following a series of really bad films, Godzilla decides against stomping on a Las Vegas casino hardly anyone knows about.  Besides, the Bellagio wouldn't give him permission to rise up out of their fountians.

2010 - Hash House a go-go opens a second Las Vegas location, this time in the Imperial Palace.  Although the Americian farm-fresh food concept clashes with the predominantly Asian theme, The food portions are large enough to feed Godzilla.

Humans eating here are best served to go in groups of two or more and splitting plates family style.  They have a $2.50 split plate charge*, but unless you eat like a linebacker, are a 300 foot tall lizard, or plan to take it home, you will be wasting a lot of food.  Food is very lively and fresh, as well as unusual.  It's not your typical ""country nasty"" (bacon, eggs, sausage, gravy, and biscuts).  It's a total re-invent.  It works, but it is a little pricey even when sharing; A split breakfast for 2, with 2 large (fresh squeezed) Orange Juices came to $29 (not counting Tip).

I love the food but not the price.  Like the Best of the Godzilla films, it only merits 3 stars.

* You can bypass the $2.50 split plate charge if someone just orders a biscuit or a plate of bacon for $1.  It costs less, but you get even more food :P"
3082,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food and well worth the wait.If you are hungry, I highly recommend this spot! Everything is made from scratch and not microwave. Anytime you are in Vegas , you will need to experience excellent food."
3083,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This was my first experience at Hash House.  From the waitress that seated us to our waiter all I can say is rude rude rude.
Our waiter did not go out of his way to accommodate my dietary needs at all.
For example I asked for sourdough toast, he replied "" we ONLY have wheat ""!!  Yet on the menu you see sandwiches served on milk bread.  I asked him about the milk bread he said ""NO "".  What ??? This makes no sense.  My pancake was good, my husband had biscuits and gravy it was ok.
Just expect poor service.  Staff is very "" gruff""."
3084,Hash House A Go Go,5,There isn't a word to describe this place..  Fantastic! awesome! delicious! Just doesn't cut it...  Worth the money time and drive to eat here..  Generous portions of excellently cooked yumminous!!  The staff is awesome!  Helpful AND Happy !!  My experience was wonderful and I definitely recommend to anyone to try anything and everything  you won't be disappointed
3085,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It should be against the law to serve portions this large to average people. The plates here are HUGE. This isn't an exaggeration. These portions are insane.

Came here for breakfast when we were staying at the Linq and the wait was 40 minutes which I hear is the usual during peak times. They have free wifi so the wait didn't seem all that long. We were seated with a wonderful waiter who was really friendly and attentive. I ordered their fried chicken and my best friend ordered the Man vs. Food version of their fried chicken. As we waited for our food, we watched other plates coming from the kitchen and the fear set in. Then our order came and I nearly cried for my friend. My plate was big (but a hungry man could probably polish it off) but her plate was easily two days worth! 

Usually a place with ridiculous portions has okay food, but they manage to still put together a stellar meal. The fried chicken has a great corn flake coating with good crunch, the mashed potatoes are a little chunky like I like, some thick cut bacon for good measure, and the most perfect biscuit I've ever had. This biscuit was so good and our wonderful waiter saw how much I was enjoying it and offered to bring some of their house made strawberry jam which really put me over the moon. My friends plate had basically double of everything on my plate plus it was coated in cheese and some chipotle sauce that really was atrocity and not for the faint of heart. I would recommend sticking to their regular fried chicken plate. 

I'll definitely be back but I'll probably just order a biscuit and strawberry jam because it's so good."
3086,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Saw this on our TV in our hotel room on one of those vegas channels.. decided to come here after looking at the menu online. Came here around 3pm and no one was there which was nice since we didn't have to wait. 

Our waitress was super nice and offered up a bunch of suggestions. I got the fried chicken benedict and the boyfriend got biscuits & gravy. The portions are epic. Way too big for one person - probably even two. My meal was good although the mashed potatoes and the plate were awkward and I didn't like them paired with the rest of the items on my plate. The chipotle sauce was amazing. Fried chicken was good, eggs very good. Overall it was good but I'd definitely get something else next time. The boyfriend really liked his biscuits and gravy but didn't like the mashed potatoes on the plate. He thought that potatoes did not go well with the biscuits and gravy. So I guess we both felt the same way about the potatoes :/"
3087,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First time and definitely a repeater. Tip:  try the crispy potatoes. The Kokomo was deliciously as was the corned beef hash which was made fresh (pulled corned beef), not canned.

Service was great and friendly. Definitely a repeater."
3088,Hash House A Go Go,3,Was not impressed....had the corned beef hash not much flavor to it.  The HH bloody Mary was good!
3089,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place gets reeeeal wild! First off they bring you some delicious biscuits and honey, that are damn near a meal on their own. Although you will be tempted, do not fill up on them, because any meal you order is coming your way and in MASSIVE portions. Even the kid's meals are huge (our friends ordered a pancake for their 3 year old daughter and it was about the same size as her core). It would be in your best interest to share. 

You will be overwhelmed by the menu, and that's okay. There are some insane concoctions, and they're both aesthetically pleasing and delicious. 

I had the garlic chicken and asparagus hash and it was delicious."
3090,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Just ehh. Rubbery eggs and bland potatoes, a dry biscuit and bad coffee. It's your basic in casino restaurant, a cheapish place to grab a bit after you just lost your mortgage payment I guess. I wouldn't go back."
3091,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It was really busy when we arrived for Sunday brunch around 11:00 a.m.   Determined to try this hot spot, we returned for a late dinner around 10:15.  Big difference.   There was no wait; the place was half empty.
I had the sage Chicken and Waffles.   The size lived up to the hype,  the taste was disappointing.   I mean the chicken smelled great and there was a crunchy exterior but the flavor didn't carry through to the inside.  The chicken pieces (2) were HUGE but somewhat mushy in the center.  And where did those bones come from??? I was assuming they would be a filets.   Maybe I didn't read the description well but the bones were a surprise.   The star of the platter was bacon waffle.   I ended up finishing the waffles and leaving the chicken.   
My friend had the meat loaf.  Again, this was a lot of food, nicely presented.   She put a dent in it but didn't finish it.
They also bought complimentary butter biscuits. These were huge and if I had only ordered a side of bacon or sausage, this would have been sufficient. 
The four stars is for the bang for your buck, the biscuits and the great waffles. I may return  as they are open 24/7 but it's not a place where I would wait for a table for more than 10 minutes."
3092,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Delicious with HUGE portions! Hash house a go go is knockout of flavor. My friends I ended up here after referencing our trusty Yelp app. Hash a go go is located in the Linq casino and hotel. I ordered the chicken rosemary house which had asparagus and served with roasted potatos. You are also offered eggs which I got scrambled and were fluffy and delicious. It is also served with either toast or biscuit the size of a baseball. My friends had egg white scramble with pesto, and the other friend had the friend chicken benedict. The fried chicken benedict was huge! I also had a sip of their bloody mary and it was delicious, and i dont even like bloody marys. The service was ok, nothing memorable, my two friend asked for water, and I feel that I shouldve checked with me if I wanted one even if I had forgotten to ask. The service did not spoil the trip, I will definantly be back, or to one of the other locations."
3093,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of my favorite places to eat! not just in Vegas but ever

I always come here when in Vegas, my favorite dish is ""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit"" it sounds like alot and it is... but it is soo good. The flavor combinations are amazing. Nothing like I have ever eaten before. If your a person who does not like their food mixed or touching each other then do not order this. Everything comes on top of each other, which is how you have to eat in order to taste how good it is. I had a BLT Bloody Mary to wash it all down. And it is just like it sounds, Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Bloody Mary, even with a slice of toast on top

If you have never been here you must go. Its a great place to eat. I have never had or heard of a bad meal coming from here. There is also a Bloody Mary bar where you can order one while you wait to be seated"
3094,Hash House A Go Go,5,Man this place really gives you a lot of food on your plate.  It's most likely gonna have a wait in the morning but it is worth it.  I had meatloaf hash and it was really really good.  My wife got the Indiana chicken combo with potatoes and bacon.  The side biscuit was really good too.  I only wish I had gravy with it.  That's what I'm getting next time.  Go here!
3095,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hash house was just OK. We arrived around 1pm on a Thursday to find handfuls of parties swarming the entrance. The wait time was estimated at 40 min for our party of three, and was pretty accurate. 

The restaurant itself was a classic diner setup--loud music and lots of tables and booths. Our waitress was nice, but the service was pretty slow. We waited about 45 min for our order. 

The food was just meh. Portions were gigantic in all means of the word, but everything came out cold, except my extra biscuit. By that time I was so hungry I scarfed it down anyway. Granted, we didn't order the famous chicken and waffles, but I don't think this place lived up to the hype."
3096,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Seriously, one of the best breakfast, brunch or dinner places I have eatin at in Las Vegas. Breakfast is big and great. A must try place"
3097,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food. Especially after a night of drinking. Little overpriced in my opinion, as it's been hit and miss when I've gone but overall, worth it"
3098,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash hash a go go doesnt dissapoint in the flavor of their food, portions or service.  We had another great experience today. We had their waffles and chicken and their tractor pancake!!!  YUM!!!   I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy which is still the best I've had."
3099,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazingly good  so worth the struggle of getting there and enjoying every single bit, strawberry margarita so good hits the spot with that bacon avocado cheese burger"
3100,Hash House A Go Go,3,As flavor flav would say; don't believe the hype! Sure it's huge portions and you get your dollars worth cuz this place ain't cheap!  Plates are enough to fill 2-3 normal eating people. S'mores mocha was the most expensive cup ($9) I've ever bought. Although it was delicious it was full of sugars and sweets. Chicken & waffles not mind blowing as the Luxe's. Kids pancake will be bigger than your actual kids face. Corn beef hash was probably our best plate. I would Pass on the watermelon kiwi lemonade. It didn't taste as good as it looked. Get here early or at off peak times. Due to this place being off the strip this place can have really long wait times.
3101,Hash House A Go Go,3,Really fun spot to try out!! My husband and I were excited to see what all the excitement was about and looking for a big breakfast. It was very busy inside but the 24 min wait was not bad. All staff was amazing! Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. My pancake was great but a little disappointed it didn't come with any sides. My husbands biscuits and gravy were pretty bland and a let down. It was good overall but just not quite as amazing as we thought. The delicious drinks and excellent staff made it worth it
3102,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Its ok.  It didn't quite live up to the hype my friend made it out to be.  Yes, the portions are huge but I wouldn't say its that cheap.  
I guess its not that bad, just not my style."
3103,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Highly overrated! Won't go back anytime soon. Food was good, but waiting 20 mins to get a table and then 40 minutes to get our food after we got seated was awful.... then to top it off a $70 Bill for 2 of us with only one alcoholic drink. Disappointed to say the least."
3104,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food was good the servings are doubled. The pancakes was massive!!! Like it will feed 2-3 people.
3105,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After visiting a few Hash Houses now I've come to believe that the food is mediocre, but the proportions have people speechless giving this place more stars than it deserves. 

I've tried many things including the {CHICKEN AND WAFFLES}, {SALMON SCRAMBLE} to the {EGGS BENEDICT} and really the food is just okay, definitely not worth the wait that there always seems to be. Yes, this place has gigantic portions at good prices, but if you are looking for quality food, I'd go elsewhere."
3106,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Top breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas!!!! Wait is about 20 mins. Portions are HUGE!!!!!!!! I got the chicken and waffles! Oh yeah ""it's bacon inside waffles... Service is awesome, atmosphere is a good time! My waiter had a Mohawk about as long my arm.. Babyyyyy.... And you can take your mimosa to go!!!"
3107,Hash House A Go Go,3,"There was tonnes of place but yet we were made to wait for ten minutes before being seated... Not sure why! It's great to have a place open so late, but the service is really slow and the menu is just alright. Go here only if there's no place else open and you have time to kill!"
3108,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went on a Thursday for brunch and waited maybe 45 minutes. My friend had to be at work so we let out waitress know and she tried to get our food down the line faster. Theres a lot of tasty sounding things on the menu and you could definitely share! I ordered the artichoke, mushroom, spinach hash which comes in a HUGE cast iron skillet. That was pretty good! My only complaint is the biscuit that comes with the dish was hard as a rock and the side of fruit was literally a chunk of cantaloupe and a slice of pineapple. Why bother? Just give me the taters."
3109,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Read the reviews, decided we had to go here. Was told the wait was 25 minutes, ended up waiting 45. 
Ordered the famous fried chicken Benedict, I would recommend it if you are wanting to pay $19 for 3/4th of a plate filled with mashed potatoes and basic dry biscuits.  My plate came with two bites of egg and one strip of bacon. No flavor AT ALL. 
They were super busy and in result we saw our waitress 4 times, did not get a refill in coffee or water. 

On a good note the Smores mocha was good, and the waffles and fried chicken was excellent. 

Drinks are really expensive and the more popular menu items are expensive as well. But with the large portions someone could easily split a meal."
3110,Hash House A Go Go,5,On my most recent trip to LV the concierge recommended Hash House and boy was she right on the money.  This place is FAB! Mimosas in a variety of flavors and the food is yummo!  Be prepared for big portions.  The chicken and waffles are to die for.  The service was good and the vibe is great to get the day started.  I highly recommend this place as a definite stop while in LV.
3111,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The portions are huge!! We only had three in our party and we could of split one meal! Except we didn't because everything sounded so good! Price is totally worth the amount of food you get! I personally loved the sage fried chicken with bacon mashed hash! So good! Service was excellent and it's a plus that it's open 24 hours, might have to make a pit stop tonight for their delicious pancakes!"
3112,Hash House A Go Go,5,Maybe the best diner in Las Vegas. Love this place when ever in town I have to go at least once.
3113,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Large portions and delicious food. I ordered the chicken and waffles and although I did not finish the meal, it was worth EVERY penny."
3114,Hash House A Go Go,1,"My first review ever. 

The short version: Rejected dive hotel buffet scraps recycled at a Hash House A GO GO.

There were 6 of us in town for my bachelor party weekend. As a fan of San Diego's Hash House I happened to convince my party to check out HH LV at the Imperial House. The service was the absolute worst with the consensus on the food being mediocre (mediocre only because some had nothing to compare Imperial Palace Hash House to). It was so bad that I need to write a review.

Here's how it went:

Fist, ever sit for breakfast after a night of hardcore binging only to yell your order to the server? The loud music became very apparent when the waitress felt compelled to ask, ""huh,"" ""what was that,"" ""can you repeat that,"" for just about all six of us at the table. This was a problem for the hung over amongst us. 

Next, a friend whom doesn't eat meat asked for a substitution for the ham, sausage and/or bacon options. She politely says to him, ""No, I'm sorry. We don't really substitute here. Usually people will order their food and just not eat the meat."" The friend of mine follows with, ""soooo, no fruit... nothing?"" ""No,"" she replies, ""sorry."" 

This was a bummer for a person who's never experienced the real deal Hash House. Sadly, it continues downhill.

We order our food. I got the Basic Breakfast which included eggs (I asked for over-medium) with bacon, potatoes and a side of biscuits and gravy (layoffa me I was starving!!). A couple people ordered the chicken (dry) and waffles while others had omelets and various other items. Two of us receive partial meals while others had complete orders delivered. At this point in time, the ice water's are dry while our server is MIA (she was overly chatty with the two/three tables she serviced). I received my side of biscuits and gravy and continued to wait for the rest of my food. Two others at the table sat without any food or water. Then the rest of my food comes. Low and behold, the eggs were undercooked (perhaps she would have heard me say over-medium had the music not been so loud?). The clear slime made the eggs inedible. The bacon was tiny, shriveled and cold (SD HH is huge, thick-cut deliciousness). The potatoes were not Hash House rosemary style potatoes. Rather, they were dive-bar buffet status potatoes that sat under a heat lamp for hours and far too hot to eat. Then, I discovered the clear like gelatin chunks in the only thing I thought to be edible, the biscuits & gravy. This was utterly disgusting. Meanwhile, as most of us are more than half-way through our breakfasts, we realize two of us at the table had yet to receive their meals.

Finally, our server breaks away from her story telling at other tables to check on us. I informed of the two missing meals. She runs in to check in the kitchen and comes back with our order slip and asks us what we're missing. She falls back to the kitchen; comes back to apologize, and carries on to her other tables. In the end, we get our meals while I borderline on losing my cookies all over the table. The server only deducted my meal from the bill and we happily leave the joint.

Thanks for reading."
3115,Hash House A Go Go,2,Worst Fried Chicken I have ever had. Came out super dry. Drier than Las Vegas' weather. Looks appealing and awesome but each bite was gruesome. You are better off buying a 10 piece bucket of KFC fried chicken. Service was not bad though.
3116,Hash House A Go Go,4,Anytime someone goes to Vegas they're always saying eat here and I can see why! The food is amazing and the portion sizes are ridiculous! I hated that I couldn't bring home leftovers. I ordered French toast and my boyfriend got pancakes. Both were delicious and we ate until we physically couldn't eat anymore. We went at dinner time and their dinner plates looked so good! We'll definitely be back next time.
3117,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge plates, good flavors, and creative dishes. My first time here I got the chicken and waffles (stuffed with bacon) and the eggs Benedict. Both dishes have really good flavor and are huge. We shared amongst three people and couldn't finish either dish. The eggs Benedict has a spicy sauce so get it on the side of you don't like spice. The chicken and waffles has a maple reduction that is really good. If you're hungry or like sharing this place is great."
3118,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Was not impressed in the least! Yes, the portions were huge but the condiments to go along with it were incredibly skimpy. Very overpriced for the quality of food. What I go back? No, not at all."
3119,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent breakfast on the strip.  Insanely huge portions don't make the mistake most people do of ordering individual meals, share!  The sage fried chicken eggs Benedict is a must try, it was even featured on Man V Food."
3120,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Rave reviews!! The price,  the food, the BLT Mary all amazing. Huge portions of food for the price. Dishes can be easily split between 2 or 3 people."
3121,Hash House A Go Go,4,Checked into the LINQ Hotel on 02/14/2015 and we had breakfast here the following morning. We are familiar with the brand since we have one in San Diego too.  Our server Steven was a good guy.  I ordered the brown sugar and banana pancake.  It was delicious but it was a ridiculously huge portion...probably enough for 4 servings.  I do wish they offered 1/2 servings to prevent waste.
3122,Hash House A Go Go,2,"To be honest I don't know what the hype is all about for this place. I tried Hash House for the first time years ago and my 2nd/last visit reminded me why I decided to never come back.

On weekends there is a wait. I mean it would be worth the wait if I actually enjoyed the food.

I ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles and my niece ordered the snickers pancakes combo. Neither were ""WOW"" or ""OMG so good."" They were just ok and I feel like I could have gotten better and cheaper somewhere else. Won't be returning."
3123,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you are looking for ridiculous amounts of food to stuff your face, this is the place for you.  Especially if you are hungover.  

This place is always packed.  You give your name, wait an hour or more, sit down to eat.  Your entire party must be there before they will seat you.  If there's just a few of you, check out the bar to see if they have some empty seats.

I've eaten here twice and both times I was completely shocked by the amount of food on my plate.  The first time I ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.  The thing that came out was the size of the plate.  Not an ordinary sized plate either.  A freaking mammoth sized plate.  The tiny bun that accompanied the pork was laughable.  A knife and fork are required for eating this thing.  The pork is covered in ketchup which was kind of odd for me.  I ordered the Kokomo on my second visit.  This is their version of a meatloaf sandwich with tomato and mozzarella.  Again, the sandwich is huge.  I was only able to eat about 2/3 of 1/2 of the sandwich.

Stop by to get some good hangover food if you have the time to wait."
3124,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We went mid week and there was about a half an hour wait. So, we went downstairs to the casino and luckily won a bit of money (main thing I enjoyed about the experience...). 

There are a few different dining rooms. Seems like most other greasy diner type restaurants where you leave feeling gross and smelling of grease. 
Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. He was as attentive as he could be given that he seemed to be quite busy with number of tables ect. 

As for the food the portion sizes are huge. That being said they focus on quantity over quality. My boyfriend and I split the chicken and waffles.  Eggo waffles taste much better. The chicken was ok. But I didn't like having the onion and other chicken toppings on the waffle. Bad combination. Overall the dish was very bland, and unfortunately the parts I did notice the flavour/taste I wish I hadn't. 

Yes, for the price you get a lot of food. But I would definitely recommend going elsewhere if you want to enjoy your food."
3125,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place! The portion size is shareable unless your hungry like me. I eat it all!! Never had a bad meal there
3126,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Las Vegas is the land of late night bad decisions. Also daytime bad decisions because it's hard to tell what time it is in the casinos. 

So what goes best with poor judgment? Heaping portions of rich fattening food and oversized adult beverages with bright colors to keep you awake.

Most of the waitstaff I've encountered here doesn't annoy me because they can read the room. Sometimes the party is over and quiet voices accompanied by dim lights is preferable while we're kicking off our heels and ready to order whatever will soak up the alcohol. 

Honestly the sweet drinks always look pretty but anything with ""Electric"" in the title doesn't appeal to me after like, rum and more rum or bourbon, etc. Their Bloody Marys complete with a snack go really well with the scrambles which I totally recommend. Biscuits and gravy and the benedicts rate just ok because they're too dense for me at times. Lesson learned. Also blessed be the cooks and their ability to make bacon that's always crispy.    

If I'm done drinking then the chicken and waffles is so so so good. Sweet and salty is the bestest. If you don't want coffee they'll make you a chocolate milk which is perfect before passing out. Sadly they have Pepsi products so that's out, but I forgive them. 

I haven't tried the meatloaf and I can never talk anyone else into ordering it. *sigh*

Service is consistently pretty good considering the customer base they have to tolerate at times. Special thanks to the waiter who saved my life by chasing me down to return the lashes I peeled off and left at the table last time. Sometimes I'm too tired to keep it classy ;)"
3127,Hash House A Go Go,5,"By far just became one of my favorite breakfast places.

Environment: The whole environment of the place was very friendly, well kept, and lively. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their time and the place is decorated/looks nice so it's not an eye sore to eat there. I personally really liked the way it looked, creative. 

Service: Service was FORSURE a big reason why this place deserved 5 stars. I had Brian H as my server, very friendly and nice guy. Enjoyed having him as a server and would def request to have him as my server again when I come back (which I forsure will be doing). He was attentive and even the people that helped us in the front when we were waiting for a place to sit was nice. 

Food: Of course the food was the main reason why it was 5/5 for me. I personally ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict. Basically, imagine enough quality food to make you full, and then add some more. The portion of this food was well worth the price. Not only was it a lot of food but it was quality good. The fried chicken was crispy, the way it should be. There were a lot of different things within it that worked so well together. Would definitely recommend getting this and I personally might even come back just to get it Togo. Quality, Quantity, and everything else you NEED. Definitely recommending this place to others."
3128,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wanted something different but still breakfast-ish. Their breakfast was still served until 5pm so it was perfect for us. We had the ""Fried Chicken Benedict"" and ""Blueberry pancake "". It was great! Great service as well."
3129,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This location of Hash House A Go Go does look a little underwhelming in the Linq, but who cares, it was delicious! Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for two, was hoping to find quick seats at the bar area, but it was completely full.  Me and my husband came for dinner and we were each going to order a dish.  Good thing we asked the waitress about the portion sizes, we stopped with just the Fried Chicken and Waffles to share.  We both really enjoyed it and killed it.  It was definitely on the heavy side but it was really good.  The fried chicken was nice and tender and the meat wasn't too greasy.  The waffles had a nice surprise in the center ....BACON.  How could a waffle get any better?  Drizzle some of that syrup on the side.  I would definitely order this again, loved this savory dish.  The only downfall to this location was that it did look a bit understaffed and the bathroom was far away downstairs.  Otherwise, I had a pleasant dining experience here."
3130,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Yesterday I went to Hash House a go go at the LINQ for breakfast. This restaurant is my favorite joint for breakfast. All the dishes are cooked start from scratch. Food portion is humongous & most of the time you have to take leftovers home. However, this time I had food left on the plate, which I didn't want to finish. I ordered the steak & eggs. The waitress told me it's ribeye. I ordered it medium rare. When the food came, the steak didn't taste like ribeye; not at all tender & juicy (as usually a ribeye is ). In fact it's cooked pretty well done & very chewy. I was very disappointed as I have high expectation for Hash House & I have highly recommended Hash House to all my friends. I hope in time the food will improve."
3131,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My friends think this place is overrated, but I still like it. I just can't get over the Sage Chicken and Waffles - the sage adds a really great flavor. Their Bloody Mary's are also quite good.

Do make peace with the fact that you will have to wait quite a while to get seated here though."
3132,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Beware those with food allergies!
My wife and I stopped in on a busy Sunday morning after hearing great things. I had my the wonderful Chicken and Waffles which at $14.99 is an absolute steal considering this place is on the strip. Perfectly crispy chicken with the soft fluffy waffles really is a treat.
My poor significant other wasn't so lucky. She suffers from a severe Gluten allergy and we both scoured over the normal menu (no gluten free f menu yet) looking for all possible options that would avoid cross contamination. After settling on a corn been hash and eggs, and quizzing the waitress on all ingredients, she assured us that the kitchen has made gf dishes before and we had nothing to worry about.
My meal came out first and we waited nearly twenty minutes for her dish to come out. The restaurant was nice enough to comp her meal due to the mixup which was very nice of them, and we were on our way.
About twenty minutes later she knew something was wrong and suspected immediately the food had been contaminated with gluten. My wife spent the next two days sick as could be and dealing with the after effects for several days after.
If you dont have food allergies then this place is great....large hearty portions of good home style food. If not, stay away. Until the kitchen learns how to prepare GF food (or any dish with special needs) properly it's not worth taking the risk."
3133,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have to start by saying that it isn't actually opened 24 hours a day (at least not during the winter) which I learned the hard way after trying to go here at 4am after a legendary Vegas night out. 

Luckily I went here prior to the failed attempt mentioned above and this place was all that I had imagined during my extensive research prior to visiting. The experience starts with the super sweet, almost overly accommodating host (whose name I can't remember). We tried to get a table for 8 but couldn't because there were only four of us present which was a little irritating but also understandable. He told us we could either wait for the others before we were seated or get seated and then move to a larger table once they came. We opted to be seated and figured we could just be separate because the others were only planning on drinking anyway. 

The drink that I got (Champagne cocktail of some sort) was ok but nothing noteworthy. My friends had some of the other cocktails (one blue one and one with watermelon) and they raved about them. Three of us ordered the chicken and waffles which was definitely a mistake because one order could have fed us all! Ok, maybe not three people but it definitely could have fed two people with moderate appetites especially if you got something else like we did. I guess it's not the waiter's job to tell you that you're ordering twice the amount you need nor do I know if they would have allowed us to split it but I do wish the option was there. The food was absolutely amazing though! The chicken was super crispy like I like and the waffles were sweet and the bacon added to the taste. My friends ordered mashed potatoes and they were good too. The next day one of my friends went back and ordered the signature Fried Chicken Benedict and said it was amazing as well but also too much for one person.

I'd definitely suggest Hash House if you're in the area
."
3134,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best breakfast on the strip! Portions are outrageously large, so small appetites beware. Highlights included their fresh and soft biscuits, peach jam, and watermelon-kiwi lemonade."
3135,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First off, I love Hash House!

You can not go wrong when you can take an Lyft for 5 dollars from the Venetian and get to hash house in a couple of minutes. What was even better was the fact that there was no wait. My son and I were seated immediately and our waiter was amazing.

My son ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and I ordered the chicken and waffles. Please don't be fooled by the kids menu. When they brought my sons food out, the first thing I said was "" I'm sorry I ordered the KIDS pancake"" the waiter laughed and said "" that is the KIDS pancake"". The look on my sons face said it all. He immediately said ""Mom I'm not going to finish this"". I was almost scared to see what my plate would look like. I have been here before but it has been years, and boy was that  plate large. I also ordered the watermelon lemonade and it was amazing. 

I absolutely adore Hash House I think think I will come EVERY time I visit Vegas now. Oh and on the way back to the hotel, we decided to walk back to the Venetian which was only 2 blocks. We NEEDED the exercise."
3136,Hash House A Go Go,3,"A coworker told me I just had to try this restaurant while in Vegas.  This is a place of super epic portions...our waitress told us this ""added to the fun""!  The food was okay, not outstanding (had the crabcake hash).  I was glad we ate here on a Thursday instead of a weekend, as who knows how long the wait would have been otherwise (only about 10-15 minutes on the day we visited, so the line moved quickly).  It was a good visit, but I would not go out of my way to eat here again...it is more of a food challenge than great meal...If you were raised to clean your plate, you're either going to fail or have a very upset stomach."
3137,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portion Size: super giant!
Service: waitress took awhile to get to us (6:30 am, it was a ghost town in there). But once she came, very attentive bit not obnoxious.
Food quality: superb.

Waffles were delicous, french toast was thick and rich. Saw another couple with the chicken and waffles, it was definitely enough to feed two, as we're both of the plates at my table."
3138,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We waited a good 45 minutes for our group of 12 to be seated. When we walked in, there was plenty of open tables...

They make their meals fresh and from scratch so it took another 25 minutes until we got our food. By this time we were definitely starving. 

I ordered the hash with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and some other vegetarian stuff since I gave up meat for Lent. Maybe it was the dish that I ordered that made it just okay. 

They serve it so fresh, it comes straight from the frying pan. lol! Portions are huge so grab someone to share with. Want to come back to try something different..."
3139,Hash House A Go Go,4,Hungry? Hungover? Try out the MVF (Man vs. Food) Sage Fried Chicken Benedict! Everything you need to fill up. The fried chicken is crispy and moist and the portion is huge! Photo to follow. enjoy!
3140,Hash House A Go Go,4,"YUM! Hash House A Go Go is definitely worth waiting for!! Even though there is always a giant line, we are always seated in a decent time frame (once for just two of us, which is much easier, but the second time with seven of us - which I considered a miracle that we were seated in just over a half hour). 

HUGE HUGE portions. My husband and I split the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and still didn't finish it!! I even had to leave mashed potatoes, my favorite thing on earth, on the plate because there was no more I could do without exploding! Everything on the plate was giant but still super tasty and well made. I feel like places with huge portions always have middling food, but Hash House definitely doesn't compromise flavor for size!! 

My husband got a crazy overflowing giant coffee drink. It was good, but I preferred my grapefruit mimosa. They have lots of different juices you can order for your mimosa, so that is definitely a plus! One of our friends was concerned that his breakfast only came with one pancake... once it came out he was concerned that his breakfast came with a WHOLE PANCAKE. Those things are not only giant, but thick and super filling (I don't think he made it through even half of it!). The pumpkin pancake that another friend got was AMAZING! So delicious. 

Definitely make time for this breakfast. It is great if you are hungover, and if you aren't, you can order a drink while waiting. If you can split with someone, though, I highly recommend it - for your own safety!"
3141,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We stopped by here on our latest trip to Vegas because of the reviews as well as Man vs Food (love that show) ... it was cool inside and all, but we were pretty unimpressed with the food. The quantities are big, but the taste is just okay. I would rather have smaller portions and have the flavor be much better. Also the service was not that great. All the servers were running around and running into each other and the customers. Probably wouldn't come here again."
3142,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Plan to wait to be seated, but it's worth the wait. Pancakes the size of pizzas, yummy egg scramble, neat decor. Service was great. Eat here and enjoy!"
3143,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House is a must every time I'm in Las Vegas. Every pancake they make is better than any other pancake I've ever had. The French toast is fantastic. The portion sizes are usually more than anyone can eat, but it doesn't hurt to try. I also recommend the meatloaf sandwich is you're their for dinner. The customer service is always good, and the food is delivered promptly."
3144,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions on every entree is REALLY REALLY BIG!

I mean, I can eat... but this place give you large portions that will test your stomach capacity. 

The last time I came here I got the Hammered Pork Tenderloin Sandwich. It was was a very hearty meal. The Pork Tenderloin was a lot bigger than the sandwich that I had to put the pork tenderloin into the shape of the buns so that I can eat the sandwich. The outer part of the sandwich I had to save for later. It came with average fries. It was salted perfectly.

This place was a little hard to find because during the time I went they were doin renovations. It was a single elevator that was outdated that took us right up to the restaurant. 

Overall, I would suggest this place for people visiting because it was definitely an experience. They try to plate their food well but it does come a bit messy. Its okay though. haha"
3145,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great pineapple mimosa! Ordered the sage chicken and waffles. It was yummy. The portion was huge. Enough for two to share. Just a little tip- bar area serves full menu and its first come first serve so if you are in a rush sit there. Staff is nice and restaurant is clean! Looking forward to coming back to try more menu items.
3146,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I came here a bit before 9am on a Sunday morning, and the wait was about 15 mins. honestly, I don't get the hype about this place. Maybe it used to be good? This was my first visit.

FOOD

Healthy Start ($14) - lots of salmon, which is great, but hardly any egg whites in it, probably 10% of the dish at best, so not rlly a scramble... It feeds about 1.5 ppl if you include the fruit. The dish was okay, a bit bland, but I didn't really mind that in this dish. It also comes with a large side of fruit, which were definitely not fresh. I believe the berries were frozen or preserved judging from the taste and look, but the mango bits were good and everything else was fine. 3 stars.

Andy's World Famous Sage Fried Chicken & Waffle tower ($20) - side-note: we don't like bacon and nixed it, but the server assured me it would still taste good. We came in knowing this dish was large (4 medium sized waffles and 2 chicken breast), so we split the two dishes between 3 people and we 3 didn't want to finish even half of it. I'd say it feeds about 2-3 ppl. The chicken was bland and very dry (I see a huge sage stick poking out of my tower, but did you use any of it to actually cook the chicken?), and the waffles were also very dry and doughy. We were sorely disappointed. Maybe I'm spoiled from LA's Roscoe's? But then again, KFC chicken on top of Eggo waffles would've been a vast improvement. 1 Star.

AMBIENCE: 

Casual, farm themed diner feels with hard seats. There's a seating area when waiting for your name to be called, and then once it's called you wait again inside in a single file line for your table. I don't get the point of being called if your table isn't ready...and the waiting area outside wasn't filled... 3 stars.

SERVICE

Waiter was kind, but not very attentive, and always in a rush/forgetting things or doing things halfway (like offering plates and not bringing them, bringing us the check without the check holder and credit card scanners like all the other tables had, and not refilling our drinks. Ever.) 1.5 Stars."
3147,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here with a group of 7 on a Saturday morning, when it is very busy and hard to find a table without waiting over 20 minutes. Its Vegas, and people are looking to recover from a long night of drinking with some hangover-curing grub. Needless to say, we were seated right away with our huge group and this was very shocking. There were tons of people waiting in line to be seated, but they had an open table for a big party. 

After being seated, the waitress flew to our table and got started on taking our orders for drinks and food. She let us know that it might take a while for us to get the food because there was a high volume of customers at the restaurant at the time,which is very understandable. Within 15 minutes of hungover moaning and groaning, we all got our food! This was the second surprise (good surprise) of the day. Our waitress was very attentive, and the food was overall decent, but it sure did work wonders with all of our hangover needs! 

This place is one of my favorite go-tos for breakfast when I am in Vegas, and I sure will be back!"
3148,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When people talk about the reason why our nation is so obese, I'm fairly certain that Hash House a Go Go is one of those reasons. Besides serving GIGANTIC portions, their food is actually really good, so you cant help but shovel it in your mouth. 

*Whips out my shovel* 

Wednesday afternoon, circa 1:30pm: No line, no wait. Seated immediately. SCORE! 

Waitress: Super funny, attentive, and playful. Yep, playful. 

The plates, piled high with over sized food, made me feel like I was eating at a giants dinner party. Which is nice, because it's not often that I get to feel small. Plates are perfect for sharing, or just gorging yourself on an insane amount of food. It should be noted that while most restaurants compensate quality for quantity, this was *not* the case at HH A Go Go. The food was delicious! 

Mango Coconut Pancake: Perfectly cooked with big chunks of fresh mango and delicately shredded coconut. If you're not a big fan of coconut, I'd be wary of this pancake. It packs a hefty serving of the white goodness. 

Biscuits and Gravy: I ordered a side of B&G, sans sausage. The biscuits were light and fluffy, and tasted homemade (I'm willing to bet they are!). The gravy was a perfect consistency and tasted so good! The boyfriend tried the sausage gravy and there were huge chunks of sausage that he LOVED. 


Thursday afternoon, circa 3:00pm: 10 minute wait 

Waitress: Busy. Not as attentive as the one before, but still very friendly and easy going. 

Grilled Portabello Mushroom Sandwich w/ crispy fries: YUM YUM! A great vegetarian option! Be careful though - you really have to LOVE mushrooms to enjoy this sandwich, as a gigantic portabello serves as the ""meat"". Pesto and goat cheese were on point and the roasted peppers added a nice crisp. Was a tad disappointed in the crispy fries though - there was nothing special about them. Not bad, but not really great either, and def not worth $5. The presentation was beautiful! (will add pics later). 

They also serve a can of beer in a paper bag so you can feel pretty gangsta. I think that alone merits a star."
3149,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great Bloody Marys and they are to go!

3150,Hash House A Go Go,5,Went there twice this weekend - the food was that good! Friday night ate at 6:30 the place was fairly empty and food came out super fast. Service was great! Saturday night was a different story - we came in at 5 and there was a wait. It was nearly 5:40 before we ate and had to leave quickly for a show. It didn't help that our waiter was joking with another table that he was still drunk from the night before and based on info from the manager it seems he didn't put in our order right away. The manager though was incredible -- it's people like that who can turn a situation around. We had the bacon avocado burger and corned beef sandwich night one and the chicken and waffles night two - everything we tried was amazing. Much less crowded Friday than Saturday so if you are in a rush come early!!
3151,Hash House A Go Go,4,Damon was outstanding in explaining the menu. He made the suggestions of having the hash. Wife had chorizo and I had the meatloaf. We both enjoyed them. I love the strong coffee and he even gave me a cup to go. Place is kinda loud but its Vegas. I enjoyed the biscuit and fresh strawberry jam. Would come back again.
3152,Hash House A Go Go,2,I wasn't impressed by food. Had better and less wait time. I had their famous chicken and waffles and didn't think it was out of this world.
3153,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First time coming here in Vegas! The food was more than abundant and I could barely finish 50% of my main course. I had the Adam Sage dish and I.T tasted really good. It's a new experience for me and I loved I.T.

Drinks wise there are many choices to choose from and for coffee lovers like me, I'd recommend you to try the coffee mint latte!"
3154,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really good. Long wait but was expected. Food took almost 45 minutes but that was expected as well. 
Couldn't complain everything was great"
3155,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love hash house a go go! It's one of my favorite open 24 hour restaurants in Vegas. This is always one of the restaurants that I have to stop by to eat at before I leave Vegas. The food is always good and the prices cheap to reasonable! Not a expensive restaurant at all.

The restaurant is usually busy so expect to wait almost an hour. I've tried the crab cake Benedict and chicken Benedict before. They were both really good! Also I have tried the pretty watermelon drink, I don't remember what it was called, but it was really good too. This place is definitely a must try when you're in Vegas."
3156,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Not much more than a Denny's.  My husband liked his biscuits and gravy. I got two eggs, bacon and potatoes.  The bacon was hard.  The eggs were hard and the potatoes were hard.  They must have sat around for awhile.  Another place over rated but mediocre. I must be difficult to impress because this was not that great to me.  Won't return...."
3157,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome sage fried chicken and biscuits Benedict. Boneless fried chicken on top of a biscuit and mashed potatoes, and covered with eggs, cheese, and chipotle gravy.  Can't wait to go again in the future :)"
3158,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was told that we had to have at least one of our meals here.  It was featured on the Travel Channel's Man vs. Food.  We came around noon on a Thursday afternoon.  The wait was approximately 40 minutes for six people.  After reviewing the menu for quite awhile, I finally decided on Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict.  We shared this tasty dish.  Also the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade is delicious.  The portions are huge, and everyone had enough left over for a second meal."
3159,Hash House A Go Go,3,Soo after a long night/morning came here food was great service was ok and the drinks yesss drinks 7.:00am still drinking they sucked had our waiter change it three different time still sucked !! But the waiter was cool about sooo two thumbs up to the food three thumbs up to the waiter
3160,Hash House A Go Go,5,I've been there twice. Both locations in las vegas. Delicious food everytime. The sage fried chicken is amazing. The waffles are so fluffy. The BLT Bloody Mary has the perfect spice to it. The portions are huge. The biscuits are so fluffy! They give you a delicious jelly for the biscuit that is homemade in house. I suggest everyone looking for a delicious and satisfying brunch to go here
3161,Hash House A Go Go,5,We are here for dinner and it was absolutely delicious with reasonable prices. We ordered a bacon avocado cheddar burger for $14 it was enough food to feed probably two people because the burger was so big. I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas!
3162,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A breakfast lovers dream!!

I had heard of this place before but since the closest location was in San Diego I soon forgot about it until someone told me I had to go while I was in Vegas. I'm so glad I took that advice!

The portions are HUGE. I have a pretty big appetite and was able to split my meal with a friend and was still full as all get out! We shared the french toast tractor combo which came with eggs and bacon and it was probably one of the best french toasts I've ever had! (Even better than Kimmie's coffee cup and I LOVE their french toast). Anywho they dip it in some kind of banana cinnamon cream which is to die for.

My cousin and her friend split the vanilla waffle combo with potatoes and that was just as yummy. Even after my stomach was aching from all of my food I still could not pass up a chance to try that wonderful waffle!

If you're in Vegas and looking for some delicious breakfast you have got to go here.. we even made a to go order for breakfast on the way home. It made the drive a little easier :)"
3163,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I expected a lot of this place to be all hype, but they really did live up to their reviews. The wait wasn't awful, about 30 minutes but we were there earlier than most and on a Wednesday. The infamous chicken and waffles was everything that fans talk about in the reviews. The French toast with grilled bananas was also an indulgent treat. Other waitresses seemed nice but we got stuck with the one who had to complain about everything we asked for. When we asked for hot water and carbonated water, she kept telling us how much further she'd have to walk to get it for us. She's the only thing I have to complain about though. This place is definitely worth the cheat day if you're trying to eat healthy. Not many low carb or low sugar options but you are in Vegas... Splurge a little!"
3164,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House visited 8/13 (Thursday)

Great food, great atmosphere, portion sizes are insane, and prices are fair (especially for Vegas)
Wait time is long, 45 minutes to be seated and factor in another 25-35min for food, but again, totally worth it.

Andy's waffle and Chicken, deeeee-liccc-ious.  

This place was on Man Vs Food, it also has pictures signed by so many celebrities that have eaten there, pretty cool to look at.  

Don't skip this place"
3165,Hash House A Go Go,1,You can skip this restaurant if you're in Vegas. The service was slow and terrible. The food was overpriced and not very good. None of the 5 people in my party were satisfied with the various meals they ordered.
3166,Hash House A Go Go,3,Pretty interesting. Huge portions for sure. I got the chicken and waffles and wasn't too impressed with the chicken. The skin didn't adhere to the batter well so it all sort of fell apart. The skin was actually soft and gross. The waffle was pretty good though. Our server seemed pretty disinterested in providing friendly service. I probably won't come back here.
3167,Hash House A Go Go,4,The chicken and waffles are some of the best I've had. The service has room for improvement
3168,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Certainly not as good as the one in San Diego. The sage fried chicken was very good. The bloody maria was exactly what I needed. 

What I specifically don't like is that it is in Imperial Palace. There are no windows, give it a basement-y feel event though the place is large and bright. 

Really, i insisted that my husband and I share, but he wanted his own. Anything is enough for 2 people and if you don't have a refrigerator or microwave in your hotel you wont take this to go so just share."
3169,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh. My. God.  The wait is worth it!!  We had their famous chicken and waffles. Need I say more? Ok...I will...the chicken was perfectly fried and moist, the waffles had bacon mixed in. It was to die for! My wife and I split the dish...both each had a chicken breast and waffle. The servers were attentive and friendly which made the experience even better.  The wait for a seat can be difficult but we put our names in and walked around then came back right before we were called to be seated."
3170,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy hell.  Words cannot describe the sheer amount of food presented to you at this place!  I ordered the sage fried chicken benedict and when it came out it looked like a buffet!  People were walking by saying ""damn!""  Super delicious, homestyle food.  Worth the hour wait on a Saturday and they also have a  bloody mary bar while you wait!  Gotta go here if you're hungover, can't be beat."
3171,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Enjoyed nearly everything about this place! The staff is friendly, the food is good and the prices of the food are fantastic in relation to the amount they serve. I shared a blueberry pecan pancake that was so big 2 of us couldn't finish it. And it was only 7.95$! I had a hot chocolate and it was very weak in flavor. My friend had a fancier hot chocolate-type drink that was 8$. My hot chocolate was 5 bux...there drinks are much too expensive. Anyways, the ambience is fun, modern and clean. I would definitely come back here multiple times!

Just keep in mind the size of the portions and share...this is one fun place you can definitely get a good deal at on the Strip. Might as well use that to your advantage!"
3172,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We stayed at The Linq so coming to Hash House was a must after hearing all the buzz on the twisted farm food so off we went on a Sunday morning..............................................and it was kinda busy:/.  Sunday morning is king of breakfast time folks and we should know that!!! So after about a 20 minute wait (take your time to peruse the menu and read all the autographed stars menus on the wall!) we seat a table of 6 armed with a feeding strategy!!!!

We all decided to share.....not much of a unique strategy, but one that the regular patron will be wise to heed!  Portion size is OUTTA CONTROL and depending on the size of your stomach this can be a good thing or an amazing trip to a food coma.  Nonetheless, sharing a plate for two will definitely be your best option.  In all we ordered 3 plates for 6 guests including the Man VS. Food favorite of the Chicken and Waffles, the Sage-Fried Chicken with maple reduction and the Fried Chicken eggs benedict.  

You don't need a blow by blow to know that the combinations of flavors and ingredients are a HOMERUN!  The sage is added into the batter and fried topped with the sweet and warm maple reduction......just luscious heaven.  Anyone who revels in savory and sweet will need to taste this dish!!  Growing up in the south this flavor profile is MANDATORY!!
The chipotle cream flowing above over easy eggs and crispy fried chicken cutlets is like a culinary homage to Niagara Falls!  Mildly spicy and yet smooth all the way folks.
The waffles are pillowy softness of a vessel to load up mashed potatoes and chicken topped with more maple syrup!  MAPLE SYRUP ON EVERYTHING!!  Ok, maybe not everything, but definitely the chicken.  If you venture to try any of the flapjacks, be brave because those things can be worn as capes!  Seriously, I saw a table of 4 big fellas next to us all order flapjacks and they all gave up halfway through.  REMEMBER!!  YOU MUST SHARE THESE PLATES!

As far as the ambiance it's a laid back, casual atmosphere, no seriousness necessary and you can come on in at anytime of the day as they are open 24hrs.  The wait staff was accommodating and friendly so no problems there.  Whether Vegas has you up or down, the Hash House will get you the GO-GO.
This is Vegas people and Hash House is like a gigantic neon light begging you to come have a great food experience!"
3173,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Chicken and waffles, blt Bloody Marys, and cold brew coffee. How can you go wrong? And the portions are huge and the price reasonable."
3174,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Let's be honest, there are ton of places to eat in Vegas. I picked this restaurant because of its menu, and who doesn't love fried chicken. For those things, it did not disappoint. The chicken is all it's hyped up to be, and no one is lying about the portion sizes; they are quite massive. I will also say I appreciated the presentation and plating - very well done. I found the drinks to be the same - quite tasty and nicely sized - but could have been a little more boozy.

But in terms of service, woah, not the greatest. I came around 7pm on Tuesday, and it wasn't busy. There was no wait/line to be seated, and half the restaurant was empty when I arrived (it did get much busier toward the end of my visit); however, I was told four times I'll be with you in a minute/under 30 seconds. It was difficult to ever get the attention of the bartender. And it took asking three times to get the check; I thought it was for free for a moment there. Whoever the bartender/waiter is needs some training.

Definitely worth a visit or two, but one visit will give you two to three meals. With better service, this would easily be 5 stars."
3175,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Another perk of staying at the Linq-Hash House A go go! Stoped in for an early breakfast and we were quickly seated. Everything on their menu sounded so delicious, making it harder to order. The serving sizes are very large and perfect for sharing! Most dishes will feed 2-3 people. 
I ordered and loved their sage fried chicken Benedict! The mashed potatoes,chipotle cream and bacon-perfectly complimented the sage chicken.  Delicious dish and I'd definitely order it again! 
Amazing food, fair service-I'll be back for more soon!"
3176,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Brisk early morning walk for breakfast in sin city. What's on the menu? How does Brown Sugar Banana Flapjacks sound? Extremely delicious, HUGE portions and super friendly, happy and attentive staff."
3177,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go is soooo good. We went and put our names on the list and then walked around the Linq promenade while we waited. It was completely worth the wait. We saw the portions are massive so we opted to share. We ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict. The chipotle cream sauce is so on point. I am short of words, but it was seriously tasty. So filling. I'm thoroughly satisfied.  I would definitely try a massive pancake next time I come. There is a reason HHAGG ranks so highly
If you search for best breakfast and brunch. Worth the wait and you will leave FULL!"
3178,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing place to go for a birthday brunch or just because you want to stuff your face. This restaurant knows their worth and they give you exactly what you deserve. I went to this place on a packed Wednesday morning in May and I was seated in 10 minutes. Was told wait would be 30+ and it wasn't. I got seated in a nice area large enough for more than four people and the waitress was ready to serve! I got a vegetarian dish and loved every bit of it. The other two dishes are the chicken and waffles and omelet. I don't remember the specific names but each of our dishes were between $11-15:
3179,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First place my friends and I ate at in Vegas after a night full of gambling.  We showed up around 5am and it was mediocre; slow seating, slow service, alright food.  One of the members of our party had to wait 10 minutes to get his food after everyone else had already received theirs. Pancakes are massive but they only give you one tablespoon of butter and one ounce of syrup so you have to ask for extras. Just a heads up, not a good idea to eat here if your not gambling/staying in this location, the restaurant doesn't validate parking."
3180,Hash House A Go Go,4,Not a huge Breakfast person and I prefer buffets when i'm in Vegas but the food was good and price was also good if you good on a weekend be ready to wait because they get packed!
3181,Hash House A Go Go,5,Freak!!! How big our their pancakes!!! When you are done trying to eat your worlds biggest pancake they bring you a pizza box to take home. Lol!!
3182,Hash House A Go Go,3,Portions are way out of control. Froze my butt off sitting in the restaurant. Food was delicious & did not disappoint. I was sad that they gave so much & I couldn't finish it. They are understaffed as well. If you're going to be that busy all the time & turn that many tables you need more servers. I ordered a s'mores hot chocolate & it came out after I was done eating my breakfast so I couldn't even enjoy it.
3183,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My experience at the original Hash House was outstanding, so I was excited that one was put in this casino.  It took me a very long time before I actually came in here.  Located in the Linq Casino, just up the escalators in the back, I was surprised that we got seated right away.  When I walked in, it kind of had that dingy diner feeling, much different that my experience in the original Hash House.  The server was friendly, and the food was served fast.  The plates and serving sizes were huge.  What I noticed this time is that it lacked flavor."
3184,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is a must a go go!!! My friends told me several years ago how awesome this place was, and the hubz and I put it on our list of places to check out when we were in Vegas for our anniversary vacation.

Staff
The staff here is absolutely amazing. They seated us quickly at a nice spacious table so we could relax (It was already almost 100 degrees outside at 7 am! We were sweating and we had hats and hydration packs). Our waitress was super friendly! She immediately brought two glasses of ice water! We asked her what she recommended to eat and she showed us the top recommendations. We also asked if they had souvenir glasses (we collect them) and she recommended the twister glass. It's a really interesting shaped glass that slants sideways. She even gave us refills on our drink! She was even prepared and got us to go boxes, take home utensils, and a bag when she saw us struggling on our food! (IT'S HUGE!!!) Literally she was an amazing waitress. I wish I had her name to thank her for making our day before we left to the final day of EDC (I ate my left overs in the room at 4 am and was a happy camper!). BTW a group of ravers coming back from the festival were horrible and left her a huge mess of wasted food and crumpled bills, no tip (I'm assuming). It broke my heart, but despite that she took care of us and we thank her for that.
EDIT: Our server was Tara S!!! Thank you Tara!!! We still are raving about our experience!
Food
The portions here are HUGE! Like seriously a plate can easily feed two people, so watch what your order. I got the chicken and waffles and the hubz got the Benedict recommended from Man vs Food. OMG!!!! the presentation was amazing!!! Like I was kinda tearing up how awesome it looked and tasted! The chicken was seasoned beautifully. It had crispy skin and it was so juicy. The waffles had large strips of bacon in them!!!! Mind blown! I don't like eggs so my husband let me try his loaded mash potatoes and I died.....they were AWESOME!!!! Like I could have just ate that! 

I can't recommend coming here enough! It was probably my favorite place to eat at in all of Vegas. It's open 24 hrs, they have cute farm decor ( My husband loves farms and especially cows so he was pleased!), and the food is definitely worth the price. I'm already missing that chicken ToT

The only con was that their photo booth didn't send my pictures to my email! So I'll have to try again next time!"
3185,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place is affordable and the portion size is enough to feed a family of four. At the end of the day I did not like it and won't be going back. I ordered the pork benedict thingy (don't know the full name) and it was massive I couldn't finish it. I wouldn't finish it if I could because it wasn't good. I could not understand the sauce/gravy on it. It had a sweet undertone and lack salt. The whole meal was salt less and me adding salt, pepper and hot sauce still did not make it flavorful.

I was so excited to have the biscuit so our waiter was kind enough to get me a side of biscuit at no cost. I should have told him to keep it because it was dry and flavorless as well. If you like massive portions and salt less/flavorless food at a affordable price this is this place for you."
3186,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We ordered the fried chicken Benedict with eggs over easy as opposed to scrambled. We split the meal between two people and barely finished it!!! Reasonably priced for the portions. I was a bit hesitant about the dish as it included chipotle cream, fresh spinach and tomatoes. But it was perfect!!! A must try. We had about a twenty minute wait to be seated at 11am, not bad, worth it"
3187,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was delicious but consider splitting something because they are HUGE portions and since we were staying in a hotel we didn't have a fridge to take leftovers back :-/

I had the hash with the roasted chicken, fresh garlic, onions, fresh asparagus and rosemary and it was phenomenal. Who knew chicken and eggs were so good together?"
3188,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Walking in we saw a crowd of people, thinking the wait would be well over an hour wait, to our surprise that was not the case, we checked in and were told the wait was only 25 mins. The place was pretty large and the flow of people leaving and being seated was pretty steady. The Bloody Mary was a large serving and made well. We were a party of 3 and ordered 2 Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles, needless to say the serving sizes were huge and we had a lot left over, we really could of shared 1 and finished but I'm glad we were able to take some home. The chicken was so juicy, crispy and tasty. The waffles with bacon was good and the bacon wasn't full of fat, it was pretty meaty, which I like. Definitely going back."
3189,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Not your average breakfast food at all! Portions are big so we shared 4 entrees among 6 of us and had more than enough. 

Best IMO was their well-known Sage chicken and waffles! Even though I am an LA guy who likes Roscoes, this was so much better! Smoked bacon is layered in the middle of the waffles! The chicken is fried to perfection & was complemented by all sorts of tasty herbs & flavors while infused w a maple reduction! 

The only entree that was iffy was the Chicken Benedict. Hollandaise sauce had some kick, so that might surprise you. 

Cinnamon roll expresso was yummy but the smore coffee drink was wayyy too sweet and sticky for me!

Prices are a little high for breakfast but this is today's Vegas not your grandpa's! Splurge and go for it- you won't regret it!

Aaron gave us great service too!

We will be back to this location which is in the back of the Linq casino & looking forward to finding the others!"
3190,Hash House A Go Go,1,"My fiancÃ©'s salad arrived fifteen minutes after the rest of the food, we had to ask for a knife four times at least, by the time she got everything her eggs were cold also her salad came with radishes which she asked removed and the vegetables weren't fresh, oh and my dad asked for toast instead of biscuit and got biscuit, not a big thing  since he didn't need bread withe such huge portions, I had the Benedict sage fried dish which was delicious but still at least twice too big then necessary, seriously just cut the portions in half or offer it as an option, the food is way too big!"
3191,Hash House A Go Go,5,We had an excellent server and a really yummy brunch! The Fiddler French toast are TO DIE FOR! So good! 10/10 recommend
3192,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions, delicious meals, best breakfast 24/7!  Tried it 3 times in one week! First had the ""basic"" for $8.95, 2 eggs any style, mash/hash potatoes and I had my eggs over easy. They were perfectly done, all fresh and great service. Second time, had the mushroom and Swiss burger- photo added. It was delicious but giant! Nearly ate it all, but just couldn't ;) strongly recommended!!!"
3193,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Bacon Waffles. That's all I need to say. 

We're talking FULL slices of delicious bacon cooked into fluffy waffles. A foodie's dream come true. Add some perfectly cooked, sage fried chicken on top and you have the perfect meal! lol. Who needs veggies?!?!  Ok, maybe not the ""perfect"" meal but so close. So, so close. 

This location was busy and we were quoted a 45 minute wait but it was more like 30 minutes and wasn't bad at all. Especially because the food and the service were worth the wait! I want to go to Vegas again just to eat this meal again. If I'm ever in prison about to be executed and I'm asked what I want my final meal to be, I'd order this chicken and waffles meal. This one. With the fried leeks. And the bacon! Oh gosh, this was so good. 

Just do yourself a favor and wait the half hour and taste this meal. Just do it. You can thank me later and please report back what you think because I know you'll love it too! Now, Go! :)"
3194,Hash House A Go Go,5,loved it. pot pie was the best & the burgers are huge and juicy
3195,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First timer to Hash House place. My best friend had been there once before and mentioned that the portions were extremely large. We had one to many drinks the night before so all I wanted was food/ CARBS... Lets just say it was the perfect place for that. We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. We shared and honestly it was a lot of food. You can't help and look around at all the meals while waiting for your food they are HUGE. The best part of the meal was the chicken whichhad stuffing, it was really flavorful. The waffles on the other hand we're ok. We also split a house salad with cucumber dressing. The dressing was pretty good. Overall I think this place is about the presentation and how BIG the items are. 

Customer Service: 9
Food:7 
Food Presentation:10"
3196,Hash House A Go Go,1,"#FAIL
This place really let me down. 
After seeing pics of the monster size proportions I was geared up for a hearty breakfast. Well take note that if you order the famous Chicken n Waffles, they will come out in about 15min. But everyone else will wait 40 for their food, so I assume chicken n waffles are pre-made and not ""farm-fresh made to order"" like they claim.

1) We waited 20 min for a table.
2) We waited 40 minutes for our food.
3) My omelet came out wrong/burnt/bland.
4) Potatoes were cold and dry.
5) Tables are high but your chairs are low, which makes for really awkward seating. Feels like you need a booster seat. 
6) Service is slow and bad. 

I could tell others were getting pissed off waiting for their food as well. 
Everyone in there looked irritated and ready to stab the waiters with a fork.

I'll avoid this place on future Vegas trips."
3197,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came here when the major munchies hit. Yeah the plates ate a little pricey but OMG they ate HUGE and worth it. Everyone who works here is super attentive and I like that shit.
3198,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is awesome and I recommend coming with family and friends. Very big portions, so bring your appetite. You may want to share an entree if you're not to hungry."
3199,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and tasty drinks. Portions are monstrous but they don't give you grief about sharing.  We shared the sage fried chicken benedict and my wife really liked the chipotle cream sauce. I did too, but can't help but wonder how awesome it would be with their sausage gravy. Sorry but I love country gravy on everything. Go mid afternoon; the brunch line is long.  Note, the wait time they give you is accurate so make sure you are back in time if you head back to the casino."
3200,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Well......we all know that the portions here are gigantic so you might as well leave your diet out the door because there's no point in trying to make ""healthy"" choices here. The wait can be long....actually it's always long. Expect at least a minimum of 35 minutes for a small group. 

Once you're seated, service here is quite prompt. The staff here are pretty equipped in getting your order and meals delivered quickly without making you feel like you have to gulp down your meal. 

I ordered the hash with sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts and egg whites.....as healthy as I can make it! Chris ordered the ""healthy start"" with a side of chicken sausage. Our friend ordered the BBBLT sandwich and another friend ordered the sage chicken. We all agreed to ordering a side of the brown sugar banana flapjack and an iced banana latte. 

Of course our eyes pretty much fell out of our socket when each of our meal arrived. We didn't know how to manage the portion, but we all took one bite at a time. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The BBBLT was met with a lot of satisfaction along with their famous sage chicken. You know it's good when all you see are smiles and thumbs up from everyone. Matter of fact, it was so good that we all agreed to come back again the next day!! I enjoyed heir biscuit. It was dense on the outside and the inside was soft and pillowy. The strawberry jam added another level of ""OMG"" to their food. The latte was one of my favorite drink which surprised me. The brown sugar flapjack was too good!! The Carmelites brown sugar and the banana was a match made in flapjack heaven. We all finished it but I think Chris and I ate a majority of it. But there is no regret! 

The next day, Chris and I returned and ordered the same thing except we ordered the snickers flapjack and a mint choco latte. The latte was okay. I prefer the banana latte over this one and the snickers was good but by far, our favorite was still the brown sugar flapjack. 

Hash House is a basic staple must here. It's nothing fancy and nothing gourmet about it. It's farm food to another level. It definitely is a place where you have to at least try it once or twice. And in our case, twice!!"
3201,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First time at this place.  It's newer and is open 24/7.  The menu is limited, but does include breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.  I had the HH Baby Burger.  It would be a huge burger if you went anywhere else.  It was made with sirloin and was really, really good.  I got the sweet potato fries and they were really good too.  My total was around $15.  The Server was really nice and on top of it.  I would go here again."
3202,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Probably my favorite meal the entire weekend--mainly because it was so much flavor and value.  I really loved the Sage Chicken & Waffles...I am NOT a big waffles person and honestly, never understood the hype around Roscoe's Chicken & Waffle but this was some seriously delicious stuff.

The chicken is moist and that crust stayed crispy THE ENTIRE MEAL. The sage and rosemary was a nice flavor addition to keep it from being your usual, and the waffles were very light and airy yet crispy on the outside.  Overall, while the dish looks very overwhelming, it was very easy to eat and never felt greasy or too heavy.  It was really really good.

I also enjoyed their Smoked Salmon Benedict--this is not the lox-style smoked salmon, this is cooked so if that's not your steeze, don't order it.  It's got a heavy handed pour of the Red Pepper cream sauce (which is not a bad thing) atop two very hearty biscuits.  

We also had the Sage Chicken Salad--and when you think to yourself ""this is not the time to be ordering a salad""...don't be fooled.  The salad is the size of a bowling ball and will feed you hearty.  

There is usually a wait--unless you have a late lunch/early dinner.  The great thing about vegas though is even though they tell you there's an hour wait, you can easily kill an hour walking around and checking back in.  There is no need to stick around when the wait is long.  We hung out at the mixologist bar downstairs--my husband really enjoyed their eclectically flavored whiskeys."
3203,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Loved the fried chicken waffles! Do yourself a favour and share though, the portions are huge!!"
3204,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food: 4, Service: 5, Satisfaction: 5!

Just do it. Don't even give this place a second thought!

As I was browsing Yelp at 11 pm on a Friday evening with a serious case of drunchies, I found this gem. Looked through the photos, saw all the awesomeness, got even more hungry, came and definitely was not disappointed.

We didn't take much time to decide on the sage fried chicken benedict, as it was labeled as a favorite by the legendary Adam Richman from Man vs. Food. The food came out pretty quickly, even with three quarters of the tables seated. I would say our shared order of the benedict only took about ten minutes to arrive. 

Okay, so let me just say, this thing was a series piece of art. It was HUGE andddd looked absolutely delectable. That doesn't happen. I'm a petite, 5'1 woman, and the plate was, I kid you not, as large as my torso. Normally, I would feel slightly disgusted, maybe frightened, but looking at this, I felt nothing but hunger and some series salvation. 

When I finally put it in my mouth, oh my. It was definitely the most perfect creation, ever. So soulful, so satisfying. There was a nice crunch that came from the chicken and bacon, paired with a moist biscuit smothered in a chipotle hollandaise sauce with a slight kick. Yes, it was heaven and yes we finished it, all of it. 

On top of all this, our server was awesome. We only ordered the benedict to share, but she was still super nice and attentive to us. She came by often, made sure we enjoyed our meal and constantly topped off our waters. 

I would say, the only improvement that would bump the food from a 4 to 5 is if the biscuit was softer. The middle was great, but the outer edges were slightly dry and hard. 

Thank you for such a fun and delicious experience!"
3205,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is really good and I can't wait to come back and try something else! When we arrived we were seated within 5 minutes despite the crowd. Our waiter greeted us right away and getting our drink orders. He was super nice and a pretty funny guy. I opted to have a spinach salad while my husband had a burger which by the way was ginormous!!! If you want huge portions then this is the spot for you. The Linq is kind of a dingy hotel and could definitely use a scrubbing  but don't let that scare you from this location! Get there early or you may have a slight wait.
3206,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This was our first visit to Hash House a Go Go (HHAGG).  We were in Las Vegas, and enjoyed a late brunch on a Tuesday.  I had the Ham, Spinach and Cheddar scramble, and my wife had the Basic breakfast.  The scramble was very good -- the spinach was not a bit slimy and the ham and cheese were excellent.  Eggs were fluffy, and slightly moist.  The crispy potatoes were exactly as advrrtised and really good.  The biscuits were good, but very dry, and my wife's bacon was limp and very greasy.  The restaurant could use a more acoustically responsive ceiling.  This was one of the louder spaces we've encountered and it was a distraction.  All-in-all, I gave our experience 3 stars, but the food and the value for money is actually about 4 and a half stars.  We'll come back, and recommend this restaurant to others"
3207,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hands down the best corned beef hash I've ever had in my life. I could eat here everyday. And I did, while we were in Vegas earlier this week. We only have one of these places in California and I REALLY wish there was more. My husband ordered the grilled cheese and he loved it! Good food, Good drinks, especially their coffee drinks and good service! I'll be back anytime I'm in Vegas."
3208,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food but the waitress double charged the bill on our friends credit card! Total bummer. 5 stars for the food though! Each time I've been there the food is well worth the wait. There is a reason it's always packed! Would comeback but next time with cash
3209,Hash House A Go Go,3,"service sucks at this location, They skipped our name 3 times at the host stand ever after reminding them twice.  Then it took the server 20 mins to take our order, and finally about 20 minutes to get the check after they cleared the plates (having to flag down our server who was chopping it up with her co-worker).  This was also after the lunch rush so it wasn't busy.   
  Anyway the chicken of the chicken and waffles was amazing, ask for extra syrup an dip your chicken, it's pretty awesome.  I saw the bacon waffle and got all excited just to discover the bacon had no flavor. meh good chicken, but $15 for fried chicken in a crappy diner/ cafeteria atmosphere, i dunno if i'd do it again."
3210,Hash House A Go Go,5,The portions are ginormous.  I couldn't not finish my whole breakfast! The food was delicious.  The food is started from scratch! It's some of the best food I have ever eaten! If you are in Vegas this is definitely a must go to eat.
3211,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Most people prefer to eat the buffets in Vegas. Some of us though prefer to try popular restaurants around the area instead. So one drunk morning me and the party decide to go to Hash A Go Go a popular place that has been mention by our friends.

Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/maple reduction ($15.95) 

Its noted that this is Mans vs Foods Favorite meal for those who don't know is Adam Richman who goes around and try to find the best grub in the world. 

Biscuit: 
the bottom layer of the entree, was fluffy and buttery 
Fried Chicken: 
Not crispy enough to my liking perhaps the gravy made it soggy before it reached the table. 
Bacon: 
Was not crispy yet again to my liking, was a bit soft. 
Benedict Eggs: 
Eggs with green/red/yellow peppers and cheese. It was soft and gooey 
Gravy: 
I believe they added too much corn starch to the gravy it was thick and bland. 
Mash Potatoes:
very hefty serving of bland and not enough buttered potatoes. 

Bacon Waffle: ($10.95) 
4 huge slices of Waffles w/bacon literally inside of it. The waffle had too much flour in it. There is also chipotle seasoning on the bottom. Do not order the waffle! 

Hash House Cobb Salad: ($13.95) 
This must be a family size salad that has smoked chicken,smokedwood bacon, tomato,red onion,blue cheese dressing and BBQ sauce but its on the trim of the plate for garnishing. This was probably the best of the 3 that we order."
3212,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Man I wish we had this in Texas!

Once I booked my trip to Vegas I made it my mission to go here at least once. We stopped by on a Saturday morning and yes, there was a wait list, but it moved quickly.  

I had to try the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict from Man V. Food and it didnt disappoint. When it's first laid in front of you you begin to question what the hell you signed up for. Then you dig in and realize that it's all good (almost). It's a lot easier if you attack it a layer or 2 at a time. If you cant finish all of it, at least knock out the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and the cream sauce. Those were the best parts. The fried pasta and the tomato dont really add anything special. Next time I come I want to try something with a bit of sweet to it instead of something entirely savory. The price is on point and pretty fair considering the amount of food that you get. The drinks can make your bill jump, though. Stick to maybe 1 juice and some water.

Overall the service was very speedy and friendly. Another thing I loved about the place was the music! During my time there I heard The Black Eyed Peas, Prince, Aaliyah, Sade, and Zhane! Now that's what I'm talking about!

If you're looking for a massive breakfast with a twist, I say go for it. Just prepare yourself for the food coma afterwards."
3213,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It's at the Rio Hotel. Portions are huge! Did I say huge , yes huge. Come hungry. It's a food spectacle. Everything is made fresh so it's not fast like a McDonald's. Still the food comes quickly. Staff is nice. Clean place. Crowded after 9 am on weekends so you may be waiting in line 5-10 minutes. Good idea is to split an entree, they let you do that. $15-$25 for breakfast. You have to try it once for the experience."
3214,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Hash House a No No - I will not return, the staff are untrained and unprofessional. The food was bland and cold and overpriced. Enormous portions mean nothing if it isn't good."
3215,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Definitely get more than you pay for; biscuits the size of softballs, pancakes the size of a serving tray, and chicken the size of, well, the whole chicken and then some. Long wait times but SO worth it! Wait staff are very nice too."
3216,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is my new fave Vegas restaurant. I love the sage chicken and waffles. The waffles have bacon cooked inside! You really can feed two people with each meal, but because the prices are so reasonable and we were wanting to try several dishes, we always opt to order separately. They have the best Bloody Mary's I have ever had. They also have a delish champagne cocktail that is perfect for brunch. Be prepared for a long wait. It is worth it!"
3217,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I believe we ordered the sage fried chicken Benedict and the corned beef hash for three people  and it was more than enough! The portions here are huge! We came here for some drunchies after a night of clubbing - they're open 24/7 which is great!    The service was not bad, the waitress was very friendly and apologetic because they were short on staff during the late night/early morning hours. It's a great place if you're feeling like some greasy food after a long night or some fried chicken any time throughout the day. With two hungry guys and I, we were not able to even finish two entrees! So if you have a small appetite, make sure you share or you'll have a ton of leftovers!"
3218,Hash House A Go Go,2,"To say that the dishes here are gargantuan in size is an understatement.  They give you enough food to feed half of China. Having a location right on the Strip is a big plus.  The fried chicken with bacon waffles and fried chicken eggs benedict always remains a favorite.  

Even though the food is decent, the wait is horrendous.  Plan about an hour to an hour  and half.  They give you the pagers but they dont work in the casino area - sucks!  The sheer volume of people that come through here has a huge impact on kitchen staff as food service is excruciatingly slow.  One of the dishes we ordered was the fried salmon sandwich and it came out 30 min after the chicken.  How does it take longer to fry fish than chicken?  The wait staff came by to check on us often and let us know that the fish would be coming out in 5 min. They must be on Spanish time cuz it took 30 min and we had to take it to go.  The person who ordered that was nonetheless very displeased since everyone else was done with their entrees before it came out. I dont think HH should levy split plate charges since it would help them out a lot to have less entrees ordered.

For a better experience, although a bit out of the way, I recommend going to the location off of the strip."
3219,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The sage fried chicken benedict is their best meal??? Dry, maybe one egg on the whole order....had to order gravy to be able to eat the dry biscuits, then were charged an extra $4.25 for that. Friend order a waffle, it was served cold...
Coffee was more like espresso...you will need lots of cream and sugar!

Been there done that, won't be back!"
3220,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food is amazing. Portions are mammoth. I have never met a meal that my husband couldn't finish until we ate here. He got the meatloaf hash which was delicious.  I got the grilled French toast which practically melted in my mouth.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for the portion size. This is a must go in Vegas!"
3221,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I am a sucker for Hash House, and I wish there was one near where I live.  I would be gianormous if there was one.  All the food is amazing, just look at the menu, stare at all the plates that go by, its hard to just pick one thing for breakfast!!

I definitely recommend getting here as early as you can for breakfast, otherwise there is going to be a long wait.  But you know what, if there is a wait, I suggest you wait anyways the food it good! 

Ordered a BLT Mary and Corned Beef Hash, tasty!!  The bloody MAry was cute, they dressed it up and put the ""sandwich fixings"" on the side just like you could make a liquid sandwich.

Portions are big so if you dont have a big appetite or a hangover you may want to share something, otherwise NOM ON!!"
3222,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was simply amazed at the size and presentation of the chicken and waffles plate! It is the biggest plate I've ever seen in my life! Â It's just a massive tower of yummyness. TheÂ 3Â waffles are filled with crispy bacon, theÂ Fried Sage Crusted ChickenÂ was really flavorful and crispy while the inside of the chicken was juicy and it paired well with the fried leeks and maple syrup.

I also tried the HH originalÂ which is made w/smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach,roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs. Pretty good too."
3223,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must and worth wait! Seriously don't be discouraged by the wait, it is totally worth it! Ordered the Basic which is an understatement, nothing basic about this dish. Chunks of potato wedges, fruit sides, fresh coffee and thick cut bacon... Mmmm. I make it a point to stop here every time I am in Vegas!"
3224,Hash House A Go Go,3,Food was extremely huge n I was so excited ! But taste was nothing special n food was not hot fresh getting lil cold ..
3225,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent food ,great service . See Louisa she provides excellent service . Don't miss this place it's a must if you are in Las Vegas!!."
3226,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is located inside The LINQ. There are escalators that take you up to the restaurant, and they are located in the middle of the casino floor. The place is open 24/7 - twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. When we arrived, there was not a wait, and we were seated immediately in a booth.

Seriously, if you are able to... share food here! We had seen pictures, but OMG. The portions here are incredibly gigantic! We both ended up having to take half of our leftovers in a to-go box. 

We ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict and the Chicken and Biscuits. I am pretty sure our jaws dropped to the floor when we started seeing food come out of the kitchen to the tables they belonged to. We realized our mistake then... we had ordered a lot of food! When our plates came out, we did not even know where to begin to dig in! The food was great. I absolutely loved the biscuits. By themselves, they are about as big as an adult's clenched fist! But they are so delicious. I know they add garnish on top of their plates for looks, but I was not a fan of this. I think I watch too much Food Network where the judges say don't put stuff on your plate that people cannot eat. Haha. 

Our server was great. Our drinks were brought out timely, as well as our food. We were checked up on to make sure everything g was going well, and our check was taken care of in a timely manner.

Overall, a great experience, and we would definitely visit again... we will just share something next time. Hehe."
3227,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I had lunch here today on my way out of Vegas. After waiting 40 minutes to be sat, I had to wait another 20 just to get a glass of water. I figured it's Vegas and crowded, food must be really good. WRONG I ordered the chicken fried steak and the was more fried batter than steak. The green beans were OK, all 5 of them that were on my plate. Service was horrible and the food did nothing to make up for it. Won't be coming back."
3228,Hash House A Go Go,5,"**WARNING** Portions here are HUGE!! I think that watching people as they receive their food is quite the entertainment though, especially if they've never been there before! Ha ha!! Food and service are excellent here! I'd def minutely go back!"
3229,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went for breakfast on Saturday 5/31. There was definitely a crowd, but reading the reviews on here, we were fine with waiting. They said it would be about a 35 min wait, but it was really maybe 15-20. The menu is great. I wanted to try one of everything. :) I ordered the House Hash - Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomato and fresh spinach. It was great. SO much food. I even ate the biscuit and I don't really eat much bread. the biscuit was crispy on the outside. So good. I definitely recommend this place. The service was great as well. Wow, it can be super  busy and you get good service? Love it. I have already recommended this place to a friend of mine who  has family in vegas. They will be trying this place out now :) I will be back as well."
3230,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Can't complain about the portions here. The food is good. Had the sage chicken mountain of potatoes eggs sauce etc. Very rich and decadent but too much for a normal person to finish. Come close to packing it all in and you won't need lunch. Pancakes were good and the size of a manhole cover - Or is it a ""personhole"" now. Focus of the hash house is richness and portion size.  Four and a half stars."
3231,Hash House A Go Go,5,Everyone in my party enjoyed the food. Especially the quantity you get for the price. 1 hour long wait to be seated and 45 minute wait to be served our food. Party of 7. Still loved it!
3232,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We went to this place on a Friday morning which wasn't too terrible of a wait, but I know this place has up to a 2 hr wait time sometime, but, the food was pretty solid but not amazing! The portion size is really the name of the game with this place. I mean the smart move to make here is to just order one meal and split it between two people cause otherwise you are taking half your meal back to the room. But overall the food is solid. The biscuits and gravy are pretty delicious which is what I got two times. The drinks would be my only real complaint. Pretty over priced and not very strong. The house mimosa is delicious but weak. I would rather go downstairs to Off the strip and get some real strong mimosas! Overall, if the wait isn't too bad I am definitely coming back for more, but if the wait is out of control I am just heading downstairs to Off The Strip because their food is amazing too and their drinks are phenomenal!"
3233,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Smoked Salmon Scramble with Basil Pesto, Tomato, Brie Cheese served with Crispy Potatoes and a Biscuit. This is one of the best scrambles I have ever had. The Smoked Salmon was amazing. Not too salty and not too fishy. The melted Brie paired so well in this scramble. Amazing flavors. The Biscuit was pretty solid and the Crispy Potatoes were top tier. Great seasoning and my friend had the Sage Fried Chicken and eggs. So bomb. This place rocks. Plus Mimosas with different juice options was great. Pineapple Mimosa is the jam.  And the service was on point."
3234,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House a Go-Go is a must-do while in Vegas. Creative and crazy creations, but ENORMOUSLY large servings. It is recommended to share a dish with a friend or a small town in Africa. The portions are a bit over the top, but I think that's their appeal to some. 

I shared with my gal-pal the Chicken and Waffles, large enough to feed the City of Compton four times over. Very tasty though. I cannot remember what the others in my party ordered but recall the grunts of delight coupled with slurping noises a plenty. 

The wait was extensive but they have a bar to kill time. I ordered the BLT Mary. Really creative, it came with a piece of toast, a packet of mayonnaise and a large slab of bacon. The Mary part itself was a bit tasteless, but a fun experience and attention grabber. 

Our server was quite friendly and attentive... quirky attitude, but I love that in a person so it was a win for me.

WARNING: Do not try this as a stop over on a long trip, you will soon find yourself asleep at the wheel and possibly killing your entire family....just saying. 

I will be back, this time with Tupperware."
3235,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had the chicken and waffles. Fantastic!  Too much food though; guess that's not a bad thing. Go early or you will wait. Place is super busy. 
Wife had Bloody Mary. Very good. 
Must go!"
3236,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was worth the wait! The sage chicken breast was HUGE and delicious. We also got the brown sugar and banana flapjack. It was so big I couldn't eat it all. I would say you can share the entrees because they're so big, but there's too many great things to try. You won't go away hungry that's for sure!"
3237,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Hash House was a disappointment across the board.

My girlfriend and I had brunch their one Sunday and not much went well.  We arrived to a 30 minute wait and were happy that it wasn't longer.  Upon being seated, we noticed that at least a third of the tables were empty.  Why the wait if there are open tables?

Upon sitting down we were greeted by a waitress who said she would be ""right back"".  I guess our definitions of ""right back"" were different because we didn't see her for another 10 minutes.  When she got back we ordered our drinks and our meals.  After this point, we didn't see our waitress again for 45 minutes.

Our meals came out roughly 20 minutes after we ordered them and we had to tell the server that we never got our drinks.  To make this worse, they messed up the drink order when we did get it.

The food looked amazing and both my girlfriend and I thought that all would be forgiven.  Turns out we were wrong.  The food was presented beautifully but unfortunately it looked much better then it tasted.  Everything was bland, very bland.  Not what I expected at all.  To top it off, I had to drag down another table's waiter to find ours and get the check.

Very disappointing.  I really wanted to like it..."
3238,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I am sad to do this because the food is great but the service at this location is inconsistent. We came here once before about six months ago and had a fantastic server; he was so great that I commented to management about his excellence on my way out. He warned us about the abundance of food and gave suggestions about what to order and he was spot on. Today, though, we went back with a larger group of 6 and the service left something to be desired. We were seated well beyond the timeframe quarter to us when we checked in, it took the server a while to come take our order and then the people sitting next to us were served one dish before we were and we had ordered the same thing. Our server had a bad attitude and couldn't be bothered with requests. She served me a coffee with no cream or milk and did not come back to bring me any even after asking, she came and try to take our plates away while we were still eating and when we asked about the status of our order her response was ""it hasn't been that long"". When the manager came to check in on us and we told him we were disappointed with the service he walked away and did nothing.  The food, especially the chicken and waffles, was really good but the poor service had a bad impact on our experience."
3239,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Fried food, heavy and saturated with fat. If you want to eat this kind of food go for it. Im sorry but the fries were cold and soggy, gravy was lumpy, and the soda tasted like chlorine."
3240,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Let me start w/some of the negatives, which were really minor. The waiters kept bringing other people's orders to our table and the waiter talked about and took our drink orders, until he realized we didn't even have a drink menu. I look at menus online so I already have an idea of what I want, but I still wanted to see a menu.
Other than than that, the service was average and the food came out timely according to the amount of food we ordered. 
I've been hearing about this place ever since I moved here. When my friends came to town and wanted to have lunch on the strip I thought about this place immediately. I looked at details about this place using yelp and we were off for our 12:00 p.m. lunch date!
Everything about the positive reviews were on point. The big portions, the taste and the selection. The only thing is that I  would've liked more hollandaise on my sage chicken benedict which consisted of coated  fried chicken, on 2 huge tasty biscuit, smoked Applewood bacon almost covered in hollandaise, which needed more of it at least on the side to keep the chicken from being dry, which I shared between the 3 of us. But why no egg on this dish? The watermelon, kiwi lemonade was good for the price, but overhyped by reviewers in my opinion. I would just stick to something simpler next time and there will definitely be a next time. I'll be fasting until then!"
3241,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fair Warning - this place is a diamond in the rough, truly...  It's inside one of the real dumps on the Strip . . . Imperial Palace.  The place reeks of yuck.  But on the second floor (just around the escalator) is this amazing place.  Think ""IHOP on steroids.""  For example, the pancake must be two pounds of batter and real fruit.  The hash really is corned beef and real potatoes and veggies (not that canned crap).  The service is quick (though expect to wait a bit); and the waitstaff is friendly.  

Don't expect Spago.

Do expect great food and portions that will bust your waistline."
3242,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food is in giant portions. I'm talking 3 people can feast on one pancake. Food was just good and worth the experience of ""go big or go home"" I personally wouldn't come back here for food but it's deff a place to check out. (: everything was good."
3243,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Cool breakfast place. Portions are huge. Couldn't finish the half...
Friendly service. Photos on the wall tell many celebs ate here."
3244,Hash House A Go Go,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Hash House! We make it a point to have a breakfast here every time we travel to Las Vegas! Everyone we have brought have also loved it! 

There are several Hash House restaurants around the country, but this one is located in the Linq hotel right on the strip. It gets very busy so expect a wait (unless you get there really early). 

Plates are ginormous! My husband and I often get one meal and split it because the portions are so large. His fave is the chicken and waffles which is delicious! I have also tried the pot pie (also delicious), and the pork tenderloin which may be the biggest item on the menu. I've never seen a piece of pork that big! 

Our favorite thing to get is the BLT Bloody Mary... believe me, try it! It comes with side fixings for a BLT sandwich. 

Next time you are in Vegas- make your way to the Linq to try Hash House! You won't be sorry!"
3245,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After a recommendation and about three tries, I was finally able to try the Hash House A Go Go. Judging the large crowds, I thought the food would've been better. It was merely OKAY. The portions were extremely large but it lacked flavor. I got the bacon stuffed waffle  with a side of potatoes. The Waffle was dry and I didn't get a fluffy feeling from it. I strongly believe the large crowds are due to the low prices and plates sizes. If you are looking for food to wow you, this is not the place."
3246,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Just had my second stop there in two years. 
This time I had a full pound bluecheese burger. It was huge and lonely cause I had no one to share a side with so I didnt get one.
The burger was JUST OK! big for sure and I think my side of Blue Cheese dressing was large enough to swim in. Nice touch but over kill for sure. 
I admit I have had a better burger, but not a bigger one and it was less then 10 bucks!!!
The space is looking dated, and needs some sprucing up, but the center strip location cant be beat.
I think I might drop in on my next trip to Vegas, cause the bacon waffels still haunt me... in a good way."
3247,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hostess with an attitude the size of their portions.

Came here on Monday night 6/11/12 around 10PM.  There are 4 of us here, friend asks for table of 6, the rude black woman tells us that you need to have half your party here in order to be seated.  We tell her that 4 is obviously greater than half of 6, instead she just gave us a table of 4.

The last 2 people come and explain that they'd like to be seated next to our group since she wasn't able to accommodate a table of 6, even though there were plenty of seats.  She looks at them as if they spoke to her in another language, and then tells them to show her where they'd like to be seated, which is obviously next to our table.  Friend goes and points out an empty spot and she says ""well you're still going to have to wait.""  5 minutes later we are finally seated at the same spot that was unoccupied the whole time.  

Portions were enormous, although the chicken was cold and dry, could be because it was near closing time, or could be because that seems to be the mantra at the Imperial Palace.  

Would I come back?  No way.  But who knows, maybe by the time of my next Vegas trip, this dying hotel will be demolished."
3248,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Been here a few times now. Each time fairly intoxicated after a night on the town.

I've ordered a variety of things off the menu, ie. chicken and waffles, corned beef hash, and fried chicken benedict. I have to say the portions are HUGE but the meal is overall bland for my taste and always arriving luke warm/room temp.

Maybe if I went for lunch I would have a better experience versus going late at night. And also maybe if I visited the other location I would have better quality dishes.

Overall, as many times as I've been here, I've had the same experience and am not too impressed. I feel like the portions are great but the food is overrated. I mean, I'll eat it when I'm drunk but does it make my mouth water? No."
3249,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Stayed at the Linq so decided to try out breakfast at the hotel turns out hash house a go go is must try! Although it seemed pretty busy we got a table within 10-15 minutes and our food was brought to us fast as well, plus the server kept asking if we were good will definitely keep having breakfast everytime I'm in town. Oh and the ""Truck driver combo"" is HUGE try it yourself"
3250,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My favorite place to go in Vegas.....portions are HUGE, prices are fair, and food is delicious! Most of the menu is available 24 hrs. Dinner is only available after 5pm, but is worth waiting until 5pm for! There are at least a dozen things on the menu I still want to try. You WILL need a box and will have leftovers for your next 2 meals. It would also be smart to share a dish if you aren't too hungry!"
3251,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Overpriced food, even for Las Vegas. Their servers were really pushy with trying to get us to order their ""new foods"". 

Pros: Waffle is good (but overpriced), seated right away.

Cons: Fried chicken is flavorless (I think there was a hint of sage, but tasted like a mouth of flour); overpriced; tucked into back of casino, not easy to get to; no bathrooms (have to go downstairs into casino, big surprise); server was overly pushy with pushing ""new menu items"", acted disappointed when didn't order ""new items""; food has ridiculous twig of rosemary sticking out of it. 

Overall, not worth it."
3252,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House is considered the most famous breakfast place in Vegas, so I couldn't really pass up trying it on my most recent trip. It doesn't fit in very well with Imperial Palace's oriental theme, but that didn't stop us from coming in.

Eater beware: the portions are HUUUUUGE. Our friends made the mistake of ordering a dish for themselves, and left at least half of it. Thankfully, I decided to split a dish with a friend, so we ended up finishing it all.

I ordered the infamous Safe Fried Chicken & Waffles. I really didn't know what to expect, so I was surprised when I was served a sculpture. Yes friends, this was a work of art. Four waffles beautifully arranged with two chicken breasts skewered on top, covered with shallots and other garnishes. 

The waffles didn't have too much syrup on them, which is exactly how I like it. To my surprise, there was bacon cooked into the waffles, which was a pleasant surprise. The chicken was pretty lightly fried, which I enjoyed as well. The crust was sweet, but not too sweet, which was a good contrast to the savoury chicken. 

Overall, a great must have experience if you've in Vegas, and not too pricey at all. Service is a bit slow on weekdays, but you're going to need to take your time with these portions."
3253,Hash House A Go Go,1,I'm sorry but mash potatoes don't go with everything! I ordered the crab cake Benedict I wanted regular breakfast potatoes and instead got a pile of mash potatoes with the Benedict on top! So gross it fell off everywhere and tasted like goulash! To top it off my bf barely took 2 bites and the waitress didn't offer to come it after I told her it was gross.
3254,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Got here at 1130 on a Sunday and the host told us the wait would be around 45 minutes, which isn't bad considering we got there during prime brunch time. 

We were seated in almost exactly the 45 minutes the host had estimated. Our waitress was very nice even though you could tell she has been swamped with orders and customers to tend to. 

The food came out in a decent time, and wow the portions here are huuge! It was a good thing my boyfriend and I decided to share. But even then, we could barely finish the two plates. 

We ordered the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion & swiss farm scramble with crispy potatoes. It also came with some fruit and a biscuit that had a great strawberry jam. The crispy potatoes were my favorite part cause well crispy potatoes are everything, no explanation needed. And vanilla waffle was the perfect ending."
3255,Hash House A Go Go,3,Not if the food was worth the wait.  1 hour to get table and then 30 min to get food.  Really loud in restaurant too
3256,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Nothing fancy. Coffee was delicious and breakfast was pretty good.  My husband to be had the pancake and it was like a monster pancake.  You will definitely be full!!!  

The wait was about 30 min ... Which for breakfast in Vegas is pretty standard.

Our waiter was in a word lame... So lame that I won't give him another second of time in my review. 

Ooh, ooh ... They didn't have a bathroom in the actual restaurant ... Awkward.... You have to use the bathroom that was in the casino."
3257,Hash House A Go Go,1,Extremely rude. I was a hotel customer and they treated me with extreme disrespect and cursed at me. Would never go back there. If you care for your respect and taste buds stay away!!!!! The manager at night is an extreme assh**e
3258,Hash House A Go Go,2,Food really isn't that good.  Fun scene and big portions but nothing that they serve is very good quality.  Don't waste your time waiting.
3259,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow, the Sage Chicken Benidect was awesome!  The Yelp picture did this plate justice. At first I was going to go with the Sage Chicken & Waffles, but suddenly changed my mind when I saw the picture of this deliciousness while scrolling through the Yelp app photos prior to ordering.  The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorfull.  The mashed potatoes, biscuit, and chipotle gravy complemented the chicken just perfectly.  I definitely will be back again next time I am in VEGAS."
3260,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went here every morning for breakfast when we were in town. Great service friendly. Portion size were huge. I didn't eat much. What I did eat was very tasty. Coffee perfect! 

Beverages were amazing. We will be staying at the Linq Hotel next time we are in town just so we can be closer to our favorite breakfast spot."
3261,Hash House A Go Go,5,"SUPER long line (went on a weekend for brunch) but totally worth it. We had 2 people and waited 1 hr. To my pleasant surprise, the fried chicken salad was my favorite. Incredibly generous portion and great fried chicken!"
3262,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We all loved this place! We had no wait for a table and our food came out pretty fast. They do not have their own restroom and in my hunt to find an open one in the casino I returned to discover that our food had already arrived! 

My husband had the pork tenderloin benedict and boy was it massive. He only finished a 3rd of it. My mom and I split the tractor special with cinnamon banana nut french toast. It you are sharing an item there is a $2.25 charge unless you order a side dish so I ordered my own side of scrambled eggs. What this meant was we each had our own eggs and one BIG piece of french toast, half a grilled banana and she ate both pieces of bacon. We also shared a fresh squeezed tangerine juice which was unusual and very good. My mom said it was the best french toast she had ever had for what that is worth! 

Our server was Travis and he was nice and helpful with suggestions since this was our first time here. I think he may have psychic powers since he suggested exactly what we were looking at in addition to the popular chicken and waffles. 

They sell the same shirts that the servers wear for about $16 and they have a variety of hats that I think are $21-ish. If you are interested in buying any merchandise tell your server as they can add it to your total bill. Otherwise, you will be like us and making a separate payment at the bar after your meal is over. The sign said they have a lot more items than what they seemed to have in stock. 

Bottom line: interesting food and atmosphere. Something different than your run of the mill chain restaurants. I really liked it."
3263,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best damn bloody Mary's in Vegas! Always make it a point to stop here.  Their portions are MASSIVE too without being over priced.
3264,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Big yummy breakfast food. AKA comfort food overload deluxe.

My x-brother-in-law told me about The Hash House A Go Go several years ago while we were fishing in Mexico. He said ""dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit the docks tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook.""  But it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.

So fast forward several years, that Hash House place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the Venetian's casino I go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a HHAGG in the Imperial Palace Hotel. So I go thru this construction maze of an entry to the IPH and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet. I go pass the performing blues brothers  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw?select=TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg#TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg blackjack dealers and up an escalater to find that they are closed! Damn, so I make plans for the next days breakfast.

Wake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so I can have B-fast before going to the Fabtech trade show. I get there NO LINE! Yes the casino gods are favoring me today. I asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. This was the first time I ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd. I then ordered up a Andy's Sage Fried Chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3BT2l3t-ifYfCtQ_Q2vbQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

FOOD: Andys Sage Fried Chicken ... This was a giant breakfast, the chicken and eggs atop a couple of biskets piled onto a heap of country style mashed potatoes loaded with bacon bits all covered up with a benedictish gravy with diced bell peppers. This was some good stuff a solid 4 **** Star for me. But less bisket and more of that yummy gravy and it would have been 5 Stars.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VDLsrE-gNdkh8N82jlEo5A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SERVICE: From the hostess taking my picture http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eo1U2kj6OyU_a_Kr9pC-6A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite. 5*****Stars

I'll be back."
3265,Hash House A Go Go,2,"My review summed up in one word is ""humph.""   
okay, lets talk about my not so stellar experience.  i was so excited to eat here bc im a huge man vs food fan.  as many of u probably know the sage chicken benedict was featured on man vs. food.  its a pretty massive meal: mashed potatoes, biscuit, chicken, egg with mozzarella, and topped with benedict sauce.  its one of those meals that after u eat it u look at ur plate and think to urself ""why did i just eat that?!"" thats exactly how i felt afterwards.  quantity is awesome but its quality that i would appreciate."
3266,Hash House A Go Go,1,Food is bland. Went with a party of five. We all didn't eat all our food. Only food we took home was my 6yo son's chicken tenders. Place is over rated. I like seasoning on my food. Won't recommend or go again.
3267,Hash House A Go Go,4,Really a 3.5.   I was disappointed given the hype!   Place has lots of younger folks.  We had chicken and waffles and Andy's chicken sage dishes.   Both were as advertised and very large portions.  My 3.5 is mainly because the Andy's signature is just a LOT of carbs.  Tons of mashed potatoes and 2 large biscuits.   Only modest amount of chicken and egg.  Everything is well priced and basically under $20 easily.
3268,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Long line. Lots of food. Overall it was good, but I would opt for something better if I had the option."
3269,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Dayummmm portions are huge! Like huge!!! If I didn't look at the Yelp reviews, my group would have over ordered! Our server didn't mention how huge their food portions were!"
3270,Hash House A Go Go,2,The Hash House in San Diego is WAY better.  I had french toast and it was not impressed.  The bread was dry and didn't have much flavor.  I had to ask for syrup two times and wait about 5 minutes before I could get any.  My husband had one of the scrambles and liked it.  The bloody mary was good but the mimosa was below average.
3271,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Still on my quest for corn-beef hash that rivals Bob's diner in Manchester Center VT, My latest stop here appeared to have potential, however turned out to be somewhat disappointing. The looked good...nice big pile of real corned beef in a cast iron skillet, however the skillet was cold, therefore the eggs, CBH, and biscuit were cold too. The hash was loaded with green papers and onions, and served on top of a pile of home fries. There was very little flavor to speak of. The meet was meaty, but sparse on seasonings. All of the flavor was cooked out of the veggies, which were soggy and tasteless. Another day, another location may be worth a try.
On the bright side, our server was terrific...prompt courteous, and good conversationalist. Came by to refill coffee, asked questions, and talked enough to seem interested, but not so much as to be a pest. Also, I might add the coffee was delicious! I Will try them again if ever in the area or near another location."
3272,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions, great waiter, excellent food!  Off the wall combinations that taste great!"
3273,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'm not big on breakfast food so I didn't think much of the place. It was good as far as that goes, their coffee beverages are amazing. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu. If I go again I will definitely share with someone because the portions are enormous."
3274,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I had the Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict this morning and let me tell you that it is alot of food. I thought the fried chicken was very tasty but the whole ensemble of food is just a mish mash of odd flavors. You have the fried chicken sittng over eggs that sit over a southern style biscuit and mashed potatoes. Then they throw some sliced tomatoes and spinach and cheese and they pour this chipotle mayo over everything. This dish is probably popular because it was featured on ""Man vs Food"". Overall I would not order this dish again but you should probably try it because it is unique."
3275,Hash House A Go Go,5,We ate a late brunch here one day.  We were told there would be a 45 minute wait and it ended up being a 5 minutes wait.  I ordered the vanilla waffle which was excellent.  My wife/friends ordered the plain breakfast and corned beef hash.  All of the dishes were great.  The portions sizes were generous and everyone left full.
3276,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really gigantic portions under $15. I can't post pictures in this review but I think their plate size was comparable to the size of a 3 month old baby! hmm... i can't think of another analogy. Very easy to get to -- right on the strip.

I went with a large group and everybody enjoyed their meal. Also, they have seating for large groups which is nice. Their wait times are ENORMOUS (an hour almost)! You can pack in a game in there to minimize the pain of waiting."
3277,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I would have given this place five stars if it we're off our first visit. We so enjoyed the food and service on Saturday, but today I felt as if I were an inconvenience to the staff. 

On our previous visit the food was hot, the hollandaise was overflowing on the Fried Chicken Benny, the Brown sugar and banana pancake was mouthwatering, and the server was attentive and friendly. The experience was so great that we came back three days later. 

This visit started rocky and didn't improve from there. When we were called to be seated we were told to stand on the mat and wait to be seated. The searer proceeded to ignore us and approach the group who happened to just be standing in the area waiting for their name to be called. Once she finally did approach us she told us that we would have to wait a bit longer to be seated (since she gave our table away). 

Once we were seated our waitress didn't approach us for 5 or so minutes and we ordered right away. We then waited about 20-25 minutes for our food, which would have been fine if it we're hot. It was not. The pancake didn't even melt the butter. The Benny had minimal hollandaise sauce which made the Benny taste dry.  To make it worse, our waitress didn't acknowledge our empty drinks until she felt it was time to bring the bill (even though she walked past us 3 times in which our cups were emptied). To say the least our experience was underwhelming. 

Moral of the story is that it felt like we may have been seated in an area where the waitress didn't have time for us because of a seating error, and proceeded to take it out on us."
3278,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Ok, so we went here on the recommendation of a travel website. Everyone raved about the large portions of good food. Well, they got the large portions right.  
If you like huge amounts of greasy, heavy food this is the place for you. My hubby and I like quality over quantity, so not really a good fit for us. Even the mimosas were not good.  
Add to that the fact that the waitress was almost non existent and we will not be back."
3279,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is AWESOME!!!  Brought my BF here for his birthday during our trip to Vegas for his birthday.  It's a regular restaurant in the second level of the Imperial Palace from the Casino.

There was four of us in the party, one had a benedict, one had the hash, my BF had the BBBLT and I had the Fried Chicken and waffles.  ALL of the food was AMAZING!!!  Such great flavors together and HUGE portions!  Be aware...the portions are enough for two or three servings, or one serving if you are hungover.  ;)

The BBBLT was huge and totally flavorful.  Not as much bacon as we thought, but it was great nonetheless.  I have the fried chicken and waffles and it was the best I've ever had!  The waffles had full strips of bacon sticking out the sides and the fried chicken was crispy and yummy!  The fried leeks was a surprising addition and the syrup was a wonderful surprise!! 

This place is a yummy addition to any trip to Vegas and will be an addition to any trip I make there.  You should go there too!  Do it...you won't be sorry!!!"
3280,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I'm sorry, but no. If you look back on any of my reviews, you'll find that it's pretty uncommon for me to go against the Yelpy grain probably because I lean towards spots that are already highly rated and they're highly rated for a reason. Additionally, I very rarely give 1-Star reviews. In this case? It's absolutely warranted, as my experience at Hash House A Go Go was a bad one through and through. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

I like the 24 hour contemporary diner vibe at Hash House A Go Go, but my service was absolutely dreadful. Sure, there were a decent number of people present at 0300 on a Sunday morning, but it certainly wasn't overwhelming and HHAGG wasn't by any means short staffed. Even so, it took a good 10 minutes for our server to notice that we'd been seated, and once our orders were put in, it was 25 minutes gone by until our server stopped by and very obviously realized that someone had gone wrong in the supply chain. He scampered back to the kitchen (literally ran) and roughly ten minutes later, or 35 minutes in total, three of our four orders came out. Ten minutes later he stopped by again, only to realize that 25% of our order was still missing. Another sprint back to the kitchen and all four of us had our food 55 minutes after putting in our orders. That is absolutely unacceptable by every single metric, and while I may have understood if something were comp'd, the thought clearly didn't even cross anyone's mind. What a mess. No Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

This is the one place where I can't complain. Opting for one of my favorite dishes (corn beef hash), I was pleased to have paid only $12.99 at a place that could very easily gouge for more. As you'll see in the picture below, these were pretty hardy portions, and I left not feeling as though I'd been ripped off. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

What on earth was this? Let's be clear, corned beef hash is finely chopped corned beef pan cooked in with potatoes and eggs maybe with a bit of cheese to bring everything together. It's a wonderful dish, and one of the great things about it is that it's exceptionally difficult to mess up.

What I received instead of corned beef hash, as you can also see in the picture, was a poorly mixed monstrosity. Lousy and flavorless ""scrambled"" eggs on the side. A hard and flavorless biscuit next door, and a mound of poorly seasoned potatoes with a clump of shredded and rubbery corned beef sitting atop it. Nothing was mixed together, nothing had good flavor, and all in all this was a colossal disappointment. No Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

It's apparent to me based on the other reviews that my experience was an odd one here at Hash House A Go Go, but off day or not, this was one of the poorer dining experiences in recent memory in a town that's chalk full of great dining. I won't be back. No Star Granted."
3281,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hash House was okay, not exactly living it up to their hype imo. The portions are GIGANTIC, so I mean, come here if you're really hungry. The downside to the huge portions is that when you're eating this giant platter of the same food over and over again, you get pretty sick of the taste about half way in. 

Service was nice, but the food was subpar. I had a pleasant dining experience, but nothing actually stood out to me. Actually, it was so mediocre, I'm not exactly sure what to even talk about in this review. Just know that this place is not a must-go-to place in Vegas. But hey, for the price and no 2 hour wait for mediocre food, then it's pretty average. This is a true neutral restaurant."
3282,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Billy is awesome!!! Very attentive and made sure we had everything we could possible want. Travis has an awesome Mohawk and graciously let us photograph it, so kudos to him! The food is delicious and HUGE. Come here hungry and you won't be disappointed. Also the coffee is absolutely amazing! Definitely a place you have to eat when you are here. Wait times can be long, especially on the weekend, but it is so worth it."
3283,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place delivers exactly what one would imagine: huge portions that are yummy and flavorful. The ambiance is very laid back, the lights are dim. It's a good place to come after a hangover or hard night of partying  

My fiancÃ© and I came here and got the fried chicken and the crab cake benedict. They  were delicious, esp the crab cake. It was so flaky and the sauces and biscuits were melt in your mouth. They put an extremely generous portion of mashed potatoes underneath it all. 

We also got the banana pecan French toast. The French toast was thick and perfectly sweet. I really enjoyed the caramelized whole banana they put on top."
3284,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG the serving size!!! When my boyfriend and I first walked into this place we thought we were in for an ok meal considering this place is inside the Imperial Palace, but boy were we wrong. As the waiter seats us we walk past a guy who is eating a pancake the size of a party platter plate. We thought this was a special thing until our meal came. My boyfriend ordered ""Andy's Crispy Indiana Style Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin"" he loved the meat and the bbq cream sauce but I fell in love with the griddled smoked mozzarella they put on top of the mashed potatoes. We both Loved the fresh corn which we both agree is the best we've ever had. I had the ""Black Skillet Chicken"" which was great and had just the right flavors. But keep in mind each dish can feed 2 to 3 people so with have a fridge ready for leftovers or plan on splitting to dishes. But altogether the food was amazing and when my boyfriend and I go back to Vegas next year we defiantly plan on eating there again."
3285,Hash House A Go Go,5,"FREE HONEY BUTTER BISCUITS.  

That's all you need to remember when coming here.  This with the Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar burger = food orgasm.. and almost real one too.  Kidding, but seriously the biscuits were ridic!  I went to the San Diego location once but I don't remember it being this good.  The portions are ginormous, the buns on my burger almost tasted like donuts, and the staff was super nice.  

I don't really need to say anymore about this place because I need you to try it if you haven't done so before.  Screw coming here only while drunk or during a hangover, I come here to pre-party!  My friends and I discovered this Vegas location by accident, and man I'm glad we did because we were super hungry and ready for some quality food.  It was big, good, and I wanted more after we were finished.

That's what she said...

about her experience...

with this restaurant."
3286,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great place to bring the family. Wait was long, but walk around the Linq so that was good. Food was YUM!"
3287,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I rate for VALUE, and in the case of a CHAIN, I rate per location, and try to narrow it to the individuals if possible so that people have the BEST possible idea of what to expect from who attending the location.

I've had nothing but good experiences at this location.  The service was always on point, and the strong points were the food options, and the atmosphere.  It had a similar feel to a couple of places you may have eaten before, but a much more in your face, visually satisfying version of some other more cookie cutter places.  

The food is what crushes it at this place.  The dish options are just so good.  The quantity that you get is ridiculously large.  If you consume a normal amount of food in a day, plan on eating one or two meals/snacks from leftovers.  The quality thankfully, is good too, so you're not sacrificing one for another.

The Pricing is here not CHEAP, but it's not OVERPRICED.  I'd say it's on par for what you would expect, and above the average lowkey restaurant because of things like quantity, quality, and novelty.  Overall a nice, family oritented, place to grab some food with the family, grab a drink, etc."
3288,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Me and my boyfriend came here this past Saturday morning around 10am and the wait was 40 min. Boy was it packed! I hadn't had my coffee yet, but I was able to buy some at the bar while we waited to be seated. There is also a bar to buy alcohol which was convenient. My boyfriend ordered a tangerine mimosa. It was soooo yummy. Finally we sit down and order our food. I think our servers name was Charice? Or something like that. She was very friendly and efficient going back and forth while also serving people at the bar. Food came pretty quickly. Hands down the best chicken and waffles! Waffles had bacon inside them. So yummy. We will definitely come back."
3289,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Too the number one spot to head to in Vegas. Excellent customer service and the food is out of this world. We had waitress Crystal phenomenal woman. If you ever go ask for her. Also the manger that was on duty at that time Scotty very helpful. We wanted to meet the chef cause he put his foot in that food, but he was busy.. Scotty the manager knew all the information we asked him. It was just a overall wonderful experience. They have a customer for life after my experience. I've never been to an restaurant where I enjoyed EVERYTHING.. Thank you so much Crystal and Scotty for everything. Oh and I can't forget the chef thank you so much"
3290,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our shuttle driver from the hotel recommended Hash House and specified that we should share orders, we ignored that order and Bob was proven right. The portions are MASSIVE. Great service, excellent food, would highly recommend."
3291,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What a fantastic meal. The restaurant is worth the wait. Our food was piping hot, delicious, and enormous servings. This was a great value for Las Vegas. We will be back."
3292,Hash House A Go Go,5,Better come on an empty stomach.. the food will make you not be able to control your portions.
3293,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This place is bad..like really bad..im baffled by the good reviews which is what led me here in the first place. perhaps its what i ordered? I went here bc of the good reviews but no. I ordered the Salmon hash bc i thought ive never seen that before let me try it. First my food came out luke warm damn near going on cold. I especially hate cold breakfast food bc its so quick to make. First the salmon was terrible, no flavor and just uggh. i seriously thought it was canned salmon till i picked around more and saw and semi not broken piece. The potatoes under it equally flavorless and warm ..how can potatoes be warm? like how long were these potatoes out ?or how old were they? potatoes hold heat so the fact that these were tepid at best again just uggghhh. My eggs were even worse, burned and crunchy and inedible. I ordered them over hard because its hard to make good eggs, when i ask for over medium they always come out undercooked. The yolks were completely solid and again COLD! The only thing worth a damn on the plate was the biscuit and even it was cold!! BUT HERE IS THE WORST !!! AND MOST CAUSE FOR CONCERN!!

EVERYTHING and I do mean everything had an underlying sweetness to it with NOTHING sweet on the plate..there is only one conclusion..they didnt wash the pan good (it was a skillet actually) and that really just killed everything for me. What kind of nasty establishment is this? i was so done. my whole plate was full after i was done cuz i couldnt eat much. i was extra hungry so super disappointed. also side note the lighting is really dim in this place. i just cant.. this place just no and if you do DO NOT EAT THE SALMON HASH!"
3294,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Decided to eat breakfast here based on others yelp reviews. Although there was a long line it seemed to go fairly quickly. The table service was good, waiter was attentive but food was a little slow to come out. Portions are huge and no way can any one person finish a meal on their own! The chicken and waffles and pancakes seemed to be very popular. Prices are the same as any other breakfast diner u might eat at around Vegas. My boyfriend and I split 1 pancake eggs bacon and potatoes for $15 with some leftover ! I highly recommend!"
3295,Hash House A Go Go,1,thee worst  order  service was the worst and the manager literally could not even manage a situation of me and my girlfriend having a service dog! her name eas fonda and literally needs to be put through elementary training school. worst management ever....keep posted! i will put a picture up of the manager txting the whole time we needed service!  super unfortunate bc the food was great.
3296,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is INSANELY HUGE and cheap. Cherry on top it's delicious!!! It's soooooo worth every penny and everyone is super nice!
3297,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I called to order togo since we had our 8 month old nephew and it's hard taking him anywhere.  I must have tried calling four times, and the phone kept ringing on and on. Finally, out of frustration, we drove there and ordered in person. I understand, the place was very busy. But I used to work for my mom's two restaurants which were very busy. We never let the phone ring on and on like that. Phone orders are just as important. Many restaurants have somebody dealing with just togo orders- I suggest Hash A Go Go look into such an option on busy days like Sunday morning. 

Ordering in person was easy and the food was ready within 15 minutes. They forgot to pack us forks and knives.  I had to run to a cafe in our hotel and ask them if I can have some from them. By this point, I was terribly disappointed with the whole experience, which is unfortunate because I like the food. 

We ordered two of the Sage fried chicken and waffles. Waffles were dry but had bacon inside of them. It comes with fresh rosemary and crisped green onions. The batter is a cornflake cereal based batter. The portions are huge, each order can feed 2-3 people. We ordered two and the four of us couldn't finish the third waffle. We ate all the chicken though. It's a lot of food."
3298,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Its over rated! we had the mushroom hash, pancakes with a side of bacon, hot chocolate and tangerine juice.  

the hot chocolate tasted like it came from a gas station , the artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes in the mushroom hash totally clashed, and the pancakes were so think i needed to follow every bite with some water! the bacon was rubbery, too!

the tangerine juice was yummy! but i ordered a small and a large came ( score!!) but the damn server still charged me for a large! i mentioned it to him and he didn't budge! 

best save your money"
3299,Hash House A Go Go,5,My favorite breakfast place in Vegas!!  The portions are huge & so delicious!!  The griddled mashed potatoes are amazing!!  I can not say one bad thing about this place.
3300,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Visited on a Sunday for brunch. I don't think we would have been disappointed in any item but the sage chicken Benedict was amazing. Portions are huge, perfect for sharing before a long day of walking the strip."
3301,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place is a heart attack waiting to happen. 

We were walking the strip when we ran into a friend of mine waiting outside of Imperial Palace. He was waiting for a friend to meet him for lunch at Hash House and was told it had really good reviews. I blame him!

Later that day on our search for food, the boyfriend mentioned he wanted to try this place out since he's never had chicken and waffles. We meandered into Imperial Palace looking for this place for a good 15 minutes before we decided to give up. On our last night, for whatever godforsaken reason, we decided to attempt to find this place again. Success!

The complimentary biscuits were delish. Huge, but delish. The pre-glazed honey on top just made it that much more heavenly. 

We ordered chicken & waffles and country fried steak. The portions were so huge we just shared the chicken & waffles, leaving the country fried steak untouched (and for whatever reason, I thought it'd be a good idea to take it to go, knowing very well we were leaving at 7am the next morning). Prior to ordering we had asked the waiter how big the portions were and if he thought we'd be able to share. He recommended 2 portions just in case we were really hungry. Now, knwoing how ginormous the portions were and looking at the size of the two of us, you'd think he would've recommmended one portion only, but whatevs. The chicken and waffle was satisfactory. It's much preferred over Roscoes in my opinion (not a fan of soggy waffles). But I guess I'm not a chicken and waffles kind of gal. 

Honestly my review may be a little skewed in retrospect. If this were anywhere other than Vegas, I probably would've given this place at least 3 stars. I'm keeping it at two since the boyfriend seemed to hate it so much. If you're going to Vegas to party and gamble, I guess this is a must eat stop. Our trip was more to experience the grandeur of Vegas, so I'm sticking with my 2 stars."
3302,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is really good with large plates. Everything is potato based so if you like tots your in the right spot. We came here for breakfast, Scott our waiter recommended the quesadilla with chorizo and it was amazing!! I got the salmon scramble with tots. I ended eating off of my boyfriends plate because it was soo huge.. Def a place to go to. And Scott was soo professional and quick with our orders!!"
3303,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This was my first time eating here and it was very good. The location is hard to find but if you know what your looking for pretty much anyone can tell you where to go. 
   The atmosphere is cool, much like everything in Vegas. The food was strange but very tasty. Everything seemed kind of mushed up on one plate, but eaten all together it had a really good flavor. The portions are very big so it's easy to share. Overall I would recommend  eating here for breakfast and some solid food."
3304,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was nowhere near as good as it was when we visited last year. Had the  chicken and waffles, both pieces of chick had the leg none still attached when we were here a year ago it was all boneless chicken. Also the chicken was dry and the breading flavorless."
3305,Hash House A Go Go,5,"NOMMERS!!!  When I have visitors in town this is the place we go.  Always!  It's all good.  Chicken and Waffles, Chicken Pot Pie, Biscuits and Honey!  So good.  I could complain that I've had some poor waiters in the past, but never see them twice."
3306,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Chicken & Waffles...so amazing!  Bacon baked right into the waffle, topped with fired chicken and crispy fried leeks on the top...cover all that with warm maple syrup...I want to go back right now!"
3307,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House - land of BIG food...and its great. Please, unless you are one of those ""one giant meal a day types"" split it or plan on taking half home. Best ones are Chicken on Waffles and I don't remember the name but Chicken and bacon and eggs on mashed potatoes and bisquits. Yep, bet cha can't eat the whole thing. Enjoy!"
3308,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very busy at prime times. Mid afternoon often has no wait. Very family friendly value menu and great Bloody's for those who need them. Large sharable portions.
West side location on Sahara not as busy."
3309,Hash House A Go Go,3,"3.8 Stars

Located upstairs in the Linq.

First impressions,  as soon as you come up the escalator you are in the waiting area of the restaurant. The interior reminds me of a trucker stop.  Lots of booth style seating, the lighting was a little dim for my liking.

Service was fast and friendly.

We ordered: 

Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles - 2 big crispy pieces of chicken breasts, very flavourful and juicy.  4 bacon laced waffles.

Big O' Chicken Pot Pie - came out piping hot, loaded with chicken, but a little too ""soupy"" I found. 

These are probably the biggest portions I have ever seen throughout all my dining experiences.  I can see why Hashhouse A GoGo has so many awards and recognition.  The portion size and plating alone is very impressive.

Overall Experience:
Service - 8/10
Cleanliness - 8/10
Food - 7.7/10
Value - 6.5/10
Parking - N/A"
3310,Hash House A Go Go,4,food was amazing.  serving size was crazy huge.  only con would be air.  you could smell cigarette smoke and it was humid.
3311,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I don't often like to stand in line for my food. We tried to miss the brunch crowd luckly the wait was only 10 min @ 2 pm.
There is a great number of choices to satisfy most tastes. I opted for the chicken and waffles that has a big enough  portion for sharing. The two chicken breast portions were huge and moist with a crispy batter. I opted for the bacon layered waffle that was very tasty. Other tasty selections enjoyed in our party was the vanilla waffle and the traditional hash.
If you are in the mood for a big breakfast 23/7. This is a good choice."
3312,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Definitely pleased!!! Everything I ate and drank was right on point. Better than I thought. I give Hash House A Go Go a ""10"""
3313,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Well worth the wait. HUGE portions, great service and great tasting food. Had the sage chicken & waffles which was the BEST CRISPIEST chicken I have ever had. Husband had the apple pancake as big as his head. Would go to again!!"
3314,Hash House A Go Go,3,"MAKE A RESERVATION :) (also, be careful using Open Table.. the location in The Linq does not use that app.. but the other location does)
This place gets busy! 

Portions are BIG, so if you aren't starving, share! Food is good, unique options, too.
Bloody Mary's.. not worth the money. Normal size, not a lot of flavor.. kinda watery. 
Service was nice, but slow! It was busy, so that may be why.. but food took forever. Drinks, too. He also forgot things and we had to ask twice...

All in all, fun Vegas type restaurant. Touristy!"
3315,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You better be hungry before venturing to the Go-Go. One-pound burgers (stuffed), sage fried chicken and waffles, bacon, bacon, AND MORE BACON! The portions are huge, the food is always excellent and make sure you have a fridge in your room for a snack after a night out, or for breakfast. This particular Hash House is in the former dump called the Imperial Palace.....now called The Quad (still a dump). Ignore the ugliness and go to the second floor and enjoy!"
3316,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food, large portions, good drinks, and open 24 hours.  What more can a person ask for in vegas.  I had the cornbeef sandwich and salad, and a bloody mary.  All good.  Will definitely go again if I have the opprortunity."
3317,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is awesome!!. Food was great and huge portions. One thing to be aware of its in a crappy old casino but once you go upstairs to the restraunt  it is like a totally diff place. staff is nice and quick. food comes out hot and huge portions. Oh and the biscuits are huge fresh made daily and the best i have had since my dads.
3318,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Delicious. The huge portions just blew me out of the water. Now, they're not impossible portions; they're just a belt-snapping, belly-bursting kind of do-able. 

I especially loved the fried chicken eggs benedict because the hollandaise sauce had that perfect tangy, creamy, almost spicy kick to it. Just perfect. Probably the best hollandaise I've ever had. The friend chicken and waffles? Similarly delicious. The waffles were fresh, with that just-barely crispy outer layer with the soft, warm, steam-filled insides, topped with a healthy pour of maple syrup along with a giant portion of delicious fried chicken: not too much fried, and not only chicken, if you know what I mean. After this meal, I literally felt drunk. My head was light and my vision was lagging behind the movement of my head. I had to go sleep off this food-hangover right after I paid the bill. Now that's class. 

I'll be honest, I haven't had anything else. But my friend said the mimosas were good. 

The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because the hostess was kind of a sourpuss. I get that we can't be seated until our whole party is there, but they were literally coming up the escalator and as we pointed that out, she turned and helped someone else, only addressing us again 15 minutes later. I don't know; I expected some more friendliness? Some more courtesy? She was definitely kind of rude in her demeanor as well. But the serving staff? Wonderful! So friendly, so helpful, and so cheery. It made me (almost) forget the girl from the front. 

The atmosphere was nice, definitely a diner kind vibe. Overall, awesome, despite being kind of out of place at the Imperial Palace! Thumbs up."
3319,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food and large portions!! Kind of a drag to find, but just ask around and someone will direct you to the restaurant. We went on a Saturday around 1pm and the wait was around 35-45 mins. Not too bad!!"
3320,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Well.... I must have ordered the wrong thing and so did my friend... I got the sage chicken salad with mango dressing... bed of greens was iceberg lettuce, the chicken dryyyyyy as the weather here in Vegas. The candied walnuts were pleasant and that's about it. Coffee was great. My friend ordered the sage chicken Benedict where she also left the chicken because it was dry... hers definitely looked better than mine but the chicken was supposed to be the main part of the dish. I think the portion size and presentation makes people believe it is better than what it is. $46.50 total bill.... excited to see it arrive disappointed by the lack of flavor."
3321,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Way too much hype about this place which is maybe why I was more disappointed than I would have been otherwise.  I ordered the egg scramble with roasted chicken and potatoes on the side.  It was BLAND. Even after adding an exorbitant amount of salt, it still was just blah.  The potatoes were fine, but OraIda at home would have been just as good.

The people I was with got the fried chicken and waffles.  The chicken was very bland, as well.  Crispy, but flavorless.  

Overall disappointing.

Service was just so-so.  

Hash House A NO Go."
3322,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Burgers were delicious! Had the blue cheese with bacon and mashed potatoes. Very tasty. Had this fast food as a quick bite after coming home late (place is open 24hrs). Chicken and waffles were also very good. Tender meat! 

Only 4 stars because it was a little pricey. $14-15 for a burger with fries is a little steep for diner food. Chicken and waffles was $20. Would check it out for quick eats by the LinQ hotel but nothing special."
3323,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yummy breakfast! Quick and attentive service! The egg Benedict were delicious. I like that they have different options for sides such as a fruit bowl. Will be coming back here next year!
3324,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This restaurant was amazing. Great food, service, and ambiance.  The food was delicious. You can taste how fresh the food is and how well prepared it's done. Definitely would go again anytime!"
3325,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went purely out of hype.  I get the hype, but don't feel the need to re-visit.  It's like a one night stand.  Once it's out of your system, there's no more need for a 2-night stand.

I had the chicken Hash-a-gogo.  Chicken was the star, hash was OK, but I think undeserving of being the restaurant namesake.  I guess Chick House A Go Go doesn't have the same ring to it.  We had a salad with chicken and blue cheese.  Cheese was super overpowering
Also ordered an omelette - pretty good!

Pros:
Dem biscuits!  YUM.
Excellent and attentive service
Flavors are decent, when the ingredients themselves can shine.  Avoid dishes smothered in cheese and sauce
$$ is worth it for the portion size

Cons:
Lineup:  we went at 12:00 - 35 min lineup
When they use cheese and sauce, I mean, it's SO much.  
'Murica has an obesity epidemic.  This is one reason why!
No washroom, you need to run downstairs to the casino"
3326,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This restaurant is located in the Imperial Palace hotel. The restaurant itself looks a little drab and old, like there used to be a previous restaurant residing here. Nevertheless, the famous Hash House a Go Go name doesn't disappoint. 

BEWARE: This place tends to get super busy, especially on weekends. So either come really early...or really late. 

I came here with three other people and was forewarned about the portions here. When we tried to order our entrees we were told that there was a charge for sharing (what?!). Thankfully, our waitress suggested that we order two entrees and two sides so we could bypass the nonsense charge. First off, my friend and I ordered morning cocktails: a pineapple champagne cocktail and a hibiscus. Unfortunately, the drinks were not good. Save the money, it's not worth it. 

Interesting menu tid-bit: Look up on their menu O'Hare of the Dog. Only in Vegas would they have that as a menu item. 

As far as entrees went, we ordered the House Smoked Fresh Salmon Hash and the Sage Fried Chicken Farm Benedict with two sides: Mac and Cheese and some vegetables. The Hash was actually not very good at all. I swear the salmon tasted like it came out of a can and it was super dry. We ended up picking at it throughout the  meal and didn't even finish it. Now the Farm Benedict on the other hand....AMAZING!!!! Hands down one of the best entrees I've had for breakfast EVER! I couldn''t stop eating it! It was a combination of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuits, and gravy heaven. I wish we had ordered two of these. Thank goodness our waitress recommended it!! She also recommended the Brown Sugar Banana flapjacks, which I've read on yelp are amazing, but we didn't order it this time around. 

I would definitely say that the food saves this place. I can't speak for other locations. The service was sub-par, and for some reason they couldn't find any extra plates for us as well as silverware! It wasn't even that busy the morning we went so how does that happen? 

Definitely coming back here for breakfast whenever I'm in Sin City. I wouldn't mind trying other locations as well. One thing's for sure: I'm gonna order that Farm Benedict next time."
3327,Hash House A Go Go,2,"OK...I like to eat. 
I eat a lot. 
I like to eat good food. 
So far, I haven't experienced that here. 

Sure, the portions are humongous and it's dressed up all pretty and nice, but that's just about it - It's all style...no substance. Yes, there's all kind of celebrity pictures complete with their signatures on the wall endorsing this place as the best place to eat. So did Planet Hollywood. We all know what happened there. I'll have to agree that it's the best place to pig out, only if you can shove all of that mountain of food into your mouth. 

I wanted to like it this time around hoping for a better experience, but it just fell flat again leaving me wanting more and unsatisfied. Yes I was stuffed, but I was still hungry. 

Does that make sense? 

How is that even possible?

They give you a mountain of food, but it lacks flavor and heart. A good example is their Chicken N Waffles. How can you mess up Chicken n Waffles?

Well....they use breast meat and deep fry the living sh*t out of it and what you're left with is a dry piece of meat that is hardly edible. In this case, looks is very deceiving. Again, all style and no substance just like some of the stuff you see in Vegas. I have to also mention that we had the creepiest server ever. He lurks around with his big bugged eyes, who reminded me of Smeagle on Lord of the Rings. 

My precious....

I also made the mistake of ordering their Mint Coffee. The only real mint they had on this was the garnish they placed on top. The mint they used to have that minty flavor is mint syrup which gives it that artificial flavor. It's overly sweet and undrinkable after a couple of sips. 

Yeah, I gave it another chance and it's time for me to move one."
3328,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awwww Man!!!!! 

This place totally ROCK!!!!

Great food, Great Service and reasonable prices for Vegas!!!!! Large Portions.  Long wait!"
3329,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Our server was very slow and was not very attentive. We had to ask other staff member for several items (I.e ketchup, take out containers, and even our check). Upon introducing herself she did not offer us a drink menu and proceeded to rush us to order in a disorganized fashion. She also failed to return to the table to check on the quality of our meal and dining experience. 

As for the food, the presentation was phenomenal!! However, the chicken was very VERY bland. I had to season it with salt and pepper at the table. The waffles had bacon baked inside however the flavor was that of burnt bacon. This awful meal actually cost me $21 plus tax.

I strongly recommend AGAINST visiting this place. Save yourself the headache and find a place with better service."
3330,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So its my first day back in Vegas. I am staying five nights at the the Golden Gate Hotel on Freemont Street. Where to eat? The hotel has a diner, but as I use them in NYC so often, I was looking for a change.

So it was recommended to me Hash House. Never even heard of the place, but the plates are ginormous.  So I head out out for a late night bite.

I order a Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion & swiss burger with a side. OMG, the plate was so large, I could only eat half of it. I had to take the rest back to me to my hotel room. But in the end I never finished it.

You have to come fully prepared on an empty stomach and I mean empty stomach, as every plate is huge. . 

Anyway food tastes pretty good and prices are quite reasonable compared to New York City. Very friendly staff.

Portion Size wise...far far too much."
3331,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Located inside the Linq. Entrance is inside the casino, take the escalators or stairs up. It was quite small spacewise - had tables, booths, bar area. Open 24/7. No bathrooms inside, have to use hotel ones downstairs in casino area.

We were staying there the night before, so we decided to go downstairs early at 7:30am on a Sunday to beat the crowd - wait was only about 5 minutes, lots of empty tables. When we left at a little past 8am, the wait time was about 20 minutes.

Waitress was quick to take our order, between 2 people we split the eggs benedict (we did our research beforehand and knew portions were huge). Food arrived quickly, waitress gave us small plates so we could share. Service was great, they were very attentive the entire time. Bill received and closed out quickly at the end. 

Food was delicious - although be prepared, this isn't your normal Benedict. The eggs are scrambled, it's served with fried chicken and biscuit and bacon and mashed potatoes. Nevertheless, it was absolutely delicious! The fried chicken was perfectly crispy but still juicy. The sauce poured on top was delicious too, had a bit of spicy kick to it. Mashed potatoes went very well with the sauce as well. 

Pricewise - very affordable for Vegas food. Under $20 for the item, enough food portion to feed 2 people = a little over $10 per person with tax and tip. Enough food for both people to walk out with full stomachs too! 

Definitely looking forward to going back and trying more things on the menu!"
3332,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG! Awesome awesome place! Let me first say be prepared to wait an hour or more no matter when you go! It's that popular, but it's worth it!!!!!! I haven't tried everything but everything I've tried has been spectacular and quite unique! The french toast is to die for with their candied walnuts and roasted sweet bananas on top. Their hashes are awesome and their pancakes OMG! The portions are crazy huge so plan on sharing. If you share the prices are really reasonable for the amount you get. Seriously, every time we go to Vegas we try and make a trip here! It's a special place to us now!"
3333,Hash House A Go Go,4,"top 3 of bloody mary's I've tried, enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere, good food, GREAT service, hubby & I will both be back!"
3334,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Me and the bf came here our first night in town starving at 2am and not wanting to go outside our hotel. The menu wasn't promising but I wanted a sandwich and figured I'd make one off their menu. 5 stars goes to the server we had, I know when I order my own creation servers get upset, ours was a rock star. She was able to suggest what would be best on how to order my avocado sandwich. 3 stars to the menu, not vegan friendly at all. My options were a salad or fries. 5 stars to the concept of their restaurants being Farm Fresh and scratch made daily, love it. Now, back to the meal. My boyfriend ordered the HH flapjack with blueberries and pecans cooked in it, with a side of mashed potatoes. I was jealous, I wanted that. I had ordered the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar burger minus the meet and cheese with extra avocado. It came with LTO and pickles. Portions were pretty big, with the flapjack being HUGE.  I've never seen one that big before, the size of a medium pizza! Mine was nothing to rave home about,  fresh avocado and plenty of it was great. The fries were some of the best ice ever had actually.  They had this crunchy seasoned exterior and soft inside, just yummy. Left me wanting to order a plate of them to go. My bf loved the flapjack, says it's the best he's ever had and we'll be back again, he's craving it. 

Their menu and food actually looks amazing, I'm sure it's all great, just not vegan friendly.


Update! 7/11  5 stars
We have been back twice since my review. It keeps getting better. Thanks for the awesome service we get every time!! Keep hooking it up on the avocado sandwiches! I menu flip and you guys keep rocking it."
3335,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My son loved the food. He said""The chocolate pancake is really good. The waitress Kai is super good and nice. ""
We had a great experience. Kai was great with ordering food and recommend the right amount of food. We got a Hash with vegetables, two kids chocolate pancake meal and one brown sugar pancake. Amazing food and wonderful service."
3336,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Not bad
My family and I went to Hash House during 4th of July week. Our server was very friendly and hospitable. Our party had 3 adults and a 9 month old baby. My son-in-law had the sage chicken Benedict. My daughter and I had the chicken pot pie. As the other reviews reflected: the portion sizes are MEGA. That's not a problem though for my son-in-law because he's a big eater. And the pot pie could have easily fed 4 people!  The sage chicken Benedict was VERY tasty. The pot pie was not as tasty. It was missing some seasoning."
3337,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food were good a bit cold when it came out. The food also takes a long long long time to come out so just make sure you are willing to wait at least 30 mins. Huge portions and long lines. It's worth to try once but wouldn't come back unless I'm craving for bacon waffles.
3338,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are for sharing...think platters, not plates. The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was ginormous. It was very tasty and I took half of it to go. The Bacon Waffle was light & tasty but my spouse was a little disappointed in the amount (lack thereof) of bacon in the waffle but I gave my bacon and all was right but again a to go box was needed. So glad we had to walk back to our hotel but once we arrived I was still so full I only wanted to sit & watch TV. Definitely worth a try!

Side Note: I would suggest making a reservation as the wait can take a while depending on the time of day. Also, take a couple friends to help manage the huge portions of food."
3339,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came to the place for my birthday and I absolutely loved it... I will be coming here again soon!!!!
3340,Hash House A Go Go,3,"eggs benedict was mostly dough.  bleh.   
mac n cheese was very heavy, I go for the pork chops as they reheat well.  

order one main and an appetizer if you're hungry and more than one person."
3341,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The food here tends to favor portion size vs quality  or flavor. Went in expecting good tasting southern influence food but got a sack of potatoes and 1/4 loaf size biscuit on my chicken Benedict. The sauce was excessive to say the least and not just in spice but also portion. I would have expected it a bit on my Benedict but it was also sloppily poured on my fruit as well. The wait was 30 min at 830 am and much longer by the time we left so expect long lines, unattentive kitchen staff, excessive carb portions and overly spiced blobs of sauce. Save your time and money and try somewhere else. While we waited for our food we saw another chicken Benedict returned to kitchen so we saw disappointment with other patrons while we were there."
3342,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Goodness! A couple fair warnings for yall.

1) You are going to have to wait. Not only for the long line which seems to be the norm, but also for the food.  The waitress will tell you ahead of time that they make all their food fresh and it'll come out as soon as it's done so it won't sit under heat lamps or anything. From the time you order, the wait could be equal to if not more than the wait to get seated.

2) HUGE portions. It'd be safe to order one thing for every two people since the portions are so huge. Unless you were as hungry as I was, in which I nearly killed my whole plate.

I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was amazeballs.  Biscuits, fried chicken, eggs, cheese, bacon, chipotle gravy...not much to complain about.  I was going hard at it but hit a wall with probably 1/4 left.  This was also called the Man vs Food dish.

Great place, great food.  I'd go back, just not in the summer when the pools are open ;)"
3343,Hash House A Go Go,5,"SOOOOOO GOOD!!! Went here on Easter for the first time and we were soooo excited to try the place. and ordered their special and their chicken and waffles. For a casual place, the plating was amazing. They give complimentary biscuits with honey butter syrup. They were as big as my fist. The chicken and waffles were delish. Bacon is made with a strip of bagel in each waffle. The chicken was very crispy and not dry. The portions here are enough for two per person. We ended up bringing home half of our food. A def must go every vegas trip."
3344,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Boyfriend had the sage chicken and I had an Indiana special ( crispy potatoes, eggs, biscuits and gravy ) and we both loved our meals. The portions on our meals were huge, so we didn't leave hungry. We should have known it was going to be big when the sage chicken was a Man Vs. Food Favorite :) Service was great and we'll be back here."
3345,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ordered the Basic, fiancÃ© ordered a pancake. Pancake was okay, kinda reminded me of a Denny's pancake except the pancake here was humongous. The basic was okay as well, the potatoes were eh but the eggs and biscuit were good. We put our names on the list and got a ticket, then played slots for about 40 mins, came back and waited another 5 mins until we were called for a table. Did take a while to get served. This was at 1pm on a Saturday. This place sure gets packed."
3346,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Serving sizes are huge, staff is friendly. Love going here and the wait is usually short every time I happen to go"
3347,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Didn't have breakfast here but had a sandwich and a salad. The portions are large but expensive: $15 for a sandwich. Had the Bar Crawl and it was decent. My dining partner had the sage fried chicken salad. First off, any halfway decent restaurant should NEVER EVER use chopped iceberg lettuce in a salad. Then, the core was in the salad I've worked at restaurants and the FIRST thing you do is remove the core. Busch league. . And the chicken seemed old. Had that gummy texture. The service was mediocre.no extra napkins. Only checked on us once. Drinks not refilled. It was ok. Just ok. Oh, and don't ask me if I need change. Assume I do. AND THE WAITRESS JUST STIFFED ME MY COIN CHANGE.  WTF?!?u"
3348,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food taste so good!!! And the presentation is on point... wait time is a little long but it is worth it.. 
I recommend to try to go early in the morning. Anything after 11am will be very busy!!!
Wait time for us took 5 mins because we came early. The plates are huge!!!! Pancakes as big as your face!! Including the kids food so beware 


Once it gets busy most of the servers won't be coming back to your table once the food is delivered to the table. 
Make sure before you leave is to check your tab. Because they might accidentally add or missed something. I ordered orange juice and my server never came back after the fact we are ready to pay."
3349,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a go-to place for us every time we're in town. Large portions of delicious, innovative food that is reasonably priced. Finally got the chicken and waffles this time around and they were absolutely incredible. Not much else to say that hasn't already been said here. Definitely go check it out for breakfast if you're in the area."
3350,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was about to turn around and take the escalator back down because of the god awful line that has formed on a Saturday morning, luckily my best friend is a platinum total rewards card holder and we didn't have to wait very long, food still took forever to come out, but we amused ourselves with silly conversations and the time flew by. Our waiter was great, he had a great sense of humor and knew how to calm the restless villagers. I was so hungry, I was about to eat my arm.

Apparently when the food arrived, I just started shoveling my pie hole as fast as I could without saying a word, I was in the zone, enjoying my chicken & waffles. My friends were talking to me and I just kept ignoring them, no time to conversate, must eat everything off the plate, I did try but the portions were huge, I just couldn't finish it.

We had a great breakfast, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves, I was so stuffed afterwards I had to go back to my hotel and take a nappy nap zzzZZZZZZZZZ"
3351,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was good, service was friendly.

We got super service (staff thought we were Diner's Club members - because of how we were dressed - more European they said). We didn't know what Diner's Club was because I don't think it is common up here but it felt like a compliment!

Huge line but we made it in after 15-20 minutes. Portions were a good size.

Interesting place to check out!"
3352,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A friend of mine recommended this spot while I was in Vegas and I loved it. We had a late breakfast and I got the chicken and waffles which were fabulous. The portions are huge and the food is great. There was a line to get seated, but it moved quickly."
3353,Hash House A Go Go,5,"amazing! a huge warning if you've never been here: get a plate and split it! this place can be very expensive if everyone gets their own entrees, but the prices are expensive because the portions are very large. my boyfriend and i split the sage fried chicken Benedict and it was absolutely amazing. i was slightly hungover, so i was terrified of eating a dish with so many items mixed together, but this was a great choice. it came with biscuits topped with scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, spinach, bacon, tomatoes (which we opted out of), fried mozzarella, and fried chicken all topped with chipotle sauce.

the dish itself sounds pretty scary but it is definitely up there as one of the best breakfast items i've ever had. the fried mozzarella reminded me of nice and melty saganaki! the chicken was also perfectly seasoned.

the service was also a treat because the waitress advised us that the portions were huge and that the food would take longer than normal, which was great. we ended up taking half the dish home and still weren't able to finish it between the two of us! delicious!"
3354,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food! Portion sizes are huge, I will probably share a plate next time and there will definitely be a next time. Sage chicken was crunchy and full of flavor. The pancakes are the size of your head! Gary our server was great. Vegas knows good customer service."
3355,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The crowded waiting area was a little more than what I can handle. My purse kept getting bumped...way too tight of a space. Cool atmosphere inside the restaurant. Absolutely the best Bloody Mary I've ever had...BLT Bloody Mary!!!! Chicken Benny S.O.S. is tasty, and HUGE!!! Good thing our room at the Linq had a fridge for the leftovers. The iced Nitro coffee is smooth!!! I'd go back, and hopefully not in as long of a wait."
3356,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just awesome. Huge amounts of food, great people working there, great people watching. Great drinks. 
While eating here I ordered the safe friend chicken Benedict. So good, it came with mashed potatoes, biscuits, bacon, eggs, friend chicken, tomato, and spinach. IT Was HUGE. next time I will get one and share. 
The boyfriend had their pancakes, which was ok. Dense and eggy. But there syrup was very good. 

This is a place you just need to try! 

Oh and the drinks were awesome too."
3357,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is awesome! Great food and huge portions. Be prepared to wait though but worth it.
3358,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I would have loved to give this place a good review/rating.  I had high expectations for the food, especially.  But when I came here for my first time, the food and service didn't deliver.  I had the sage fried chicken and waffles and was not impressed at all.  The food presentation was sloppy, and it tasted very bland.  As for the service, me and my boyfriend were seated for a good ten minutes before anyone greeted us to get our drink order, and it wasn't busy either."
3359,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I walked around for maybe an hour trying to decide where to eat. I finally decided on this place because I recognized the name. There was a wait so I had a drink and ate at the bar. The bartender was great! I decided on the chicken and waffles, yes it looks great and is picture worthy, but I was disappointed in the taste of the waffles. The chicken tasted ok the breading was rather thick and crispy.  

I've been to several chicken and waffle joints from Roscoes and LoLo's their waffles have a distinct taste, this did not."
3360,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First time: I was searching for breakfast. I tried to go HEALTHY but for some reason most places in Vegas don't do healthy. 

I got some type of egg white scramble with two types of veggies the serving was pretty small but loads of fresh fruits. The rest of the food on the Menu was massive. Great place.

Overpriced for the little amount of food we had. Food had no seasoning."
3361,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place hit the spot. Good service, food and ambiance can't go wrong. We all enjoyed it and our party was like 15 ppl. We definitely will come back"
3362,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was there for a super quick breakfast, but that was not what really happened. The portions are huge and the breakfast was pretty decent. They actually had awesome and very quick service. Definitely recommend this place, but make sure to go hungry!"
3363,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came during their lunch rush (around 1 PM). We were told the wait would be around an hour, but we were seated a lot sooner than that. Major plus! Our server Gabby was friendly and worked efficiently.
 I ordered their corn beef hash. I will start with the biscuit and strawberry jam. Delicious! The biscuit was crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Now on to the hash and corn beef. I felt like it could have been seasoned more. I asked a few of the people at our table (we were a group of 12) and they felt the same about their dishes as well. Those who ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles and the sage fried chicken benedict had no complaints. Those are two of the more popular items on their menu. Overall, it was a nice experience.  I would come back again and try something else on their menu."
3364,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a great place for breakfast but you better be hungry!

The portions are huge, would recommending ordering only one plate for two people. 

Great flavor and awesome service. 

Would recommend"
3365,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just had a fantastic dinner here with my girlfriend  and it was delicious. Excellent  presentation  and the meal itself was excellent. Of course they serve you wayyy to much food even after splitting a meal. But the main star of our meal was our waitress Koti ,who catered  to our every need and was quite pleasurable  chatting with too. I also remember her saying her mom was the manager of the the newly opened Hash House in Henderson, so im sure that one is just as great. Definitely  will be coming  back again!"
3366,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My sister wanted to go here while we were visiting from the Bay Area. Recently heard of it but not much details. Get there and it's unbelievably packed but to my surprise they move people in pretty fast. Had a great server, he's worked there for 7 years and gave us the best recommendations. Our food came out in good time, looked good and was hot! Tasted even better! Portion sizes were unreal. Pancakes the size of medium pizzas. I had the chicken and waffles 2 huge breast fried served on top of 4 bacon stuffed waffles! I also had the banana latte and it was super delicious. Most disappointing thing was it cost almost $8 and was smaller than a tall Starbucks coffee. Our entire family loved this place and our food! Nice treat, time for a nap!!! Btw most of the food came home with us."
3367,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food, big portions and friendly staff. Why not stop at Hash House? Great place to eat but buyer beware you may be tired after! I have eaten here on numerous occasions when visiting Vegas but have since stopped when I realized how tired the food made me. You can't go wrong with most items on the menu and I really love the Sage Chicken. A must try!"
3368,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When in Vegas, a must-eat for us. Legendary portion size, and a full drink menu served 24/7. More locations to choose from, but up the escalator at the Linq was most convenient. Being from Indiana, we favor the Hoosier selections portion of the menu. The Breaded Tenderloin is very good as is- tenderloin pounded thin and the size of a hubcap. But, one modification for authenticity....hold the ketchup and add mayo! Pickle, onion and (no ketchup) would make the offering perfect, easily big enough to share! Pairs beautifully with the spicy Bloody. You may have a little wait in season, but well worth it!"
3369,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome breakfast. Everything was good. Contemporary layout but still welcoming. The chicken and waffles are huge!!
3370,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes and they were amazing!  Some of the best food I have had in a long time.  Also got the huckleberry lemonade drink and it was totally delicious.  My sister loved her fried chicken too, go here!"
3371,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My favorite meal of the day is breakfast, and Hash a Go Go did not disappoint! Shareable portions and tastiness that will fulfill any tummy!"
3372,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food is great here! The portion size versus price is great as well. The portion sizes are enough for 3 people. 

I had the coffee with Bailey's in it that was delicious and the Andy's sage fried chicken. This dish is massive! 2 of us didn't even put a dent in it. 

Would definitely recommend this restaurant."
3373,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Would give it 0 stars if I could! First off, they seated my party of 5 in a corner booth that was very hot. I mean no air circulation at all. I asked the waiter if it was always this hot, and he replied yes. 
Then, the girl in the booth next to us had a seizure. Her boyfriend started dumping glasses of water over her head and she was not waking up. When she did finally wake up, she started vomiting at the table. I asked our waiter if we could be moved, but he said it was no big deal and the paramedics would be taking her away in s couple of minutes.
Then, a man came to our table that I assume is a manager at the restaurant and asked if we would like to move. We said yes, and as he was walking us to a different table, I slipped on the wooden floor and fell. Both my Bloody Mary and my water went flying as I went down. They helped me up and had the paramedics look at my arm (I broke my fall with it) since they were already there for the girl with the seizures anyways.
We noticed an immediate difference in the temperature on that side of the restaurant, it was much cooler. When our food came, one of the girls that ordered the Cobb salad asked for a side of BBQ sauce, and was told it would be an additional $1.25. She pointed out that the menu said it was included with the salad, so he brought it to her and the other person who had ordered a Cobb salad.
I had to ask them to replace my Bloody Mary and water that ended up on the floor.  The manager came over and I told him that we had asked to move from our table earlier, but the waiter had told us no. He said that wasn't his department.
We got the bill and it looked like I had been charged for both of my bloody Mary's, and the waiter smartly replied, ""that's why there  is a minus charge at the end."" They did not comp us for ANYTHING, even though we were traumatized by the whole horrible experience. We will never eat there again!
OMG! Update!!! I just got sick as a dog when I got back to my room in Vegas. Coming out both ends!! 
Def food poisoning and it hit me hard and fast!"
3374,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the Hash House at the Link, and it's my 2nd time. Wow! Just simply... wow! The food portions are immense. The biscuits are huge, fresh, and amazing with their homemade strawberry jam. We had Corned beef Hash, avocado bacon scramble, and just the Simple eggs and bacon plate. All were extremely delicious, with taste buds bursting with every bite. We had the Huckleberry Sin and I'll be damned if it wasn't full of debaucherous goodness! Our server was Billy... and he's a total Ryan Reynolds. Tell him that too... he'll love you for it. Needless to say, we loved it, and we will continue to hit up this place in the years to come. Thank you for the hospitality, great food, and awesome environment! ""What happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas"" but the word of mouth won't. I'm recommending this place to all of my friends and to anyone following. Happy Eating!"
3375,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Wooooow the portions are sooooo big!!!! Everything you order is oversized!!! I couldn't finish a thing, which would've been nice if I had somewhere to take it back. But we hit the road right after (not smart, as we all got struck with massive food coma after our meal here), so unfortunately a lot went to waste :(

My friend and I shared the chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was nice. Crispy skin, juicy meat. Very enjoyable. The waffles were whatever. I expected a lot more out of them, but they're just waffles. This dish comes with a lot of just random things on it, I suppose for aesthetics. But you will really just ignore all that filler stuff. We just had to try it because it was a famous dish at a famous restaurant. 3/5 ratings because it wasn't amazing, but it was still good.

The wait was long, so they were giving out free mimosas and bloody marys! We were still recovering from our weekend.. So we really didn't take part in that offer.. But I thought it was nice. The atmosphere is very loud, and the waiters are always hustling. I recommend sharing your plates, because the portions are seriously gigantic. Don't know how one person could eat all that food!"
3376,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best breakfast in las Vegas Hands down. This place set its own standard and runs with it ! Take a to go box !
3377,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place promised the lady that they had the best pancakes you can find. Being someone who knows how serious she is about pancakes I thought there was no way she would NOT be disappointed. They proved me wrong for sure and she did in fact confirm they were insanely delicious. I had my own French Toast deal going on so couldn't even fathom idea of trying her pancakes but I believe it. 

This place is a little pricey but for Vegas prices it's not too bad. The drinks are really where they get you but pay attention to menu as many of the cocktails and drinks come with nice souvenir glasses if you ask for them. I had the some crazy fresh watermelon cocktail and it was like heaven."
3378,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yum yum yum yum! Good hot good, service and selection. It's a must try for any foodie. Delicious. Great cocktails too."
3379,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place for the price especially located in the strip. Was busy even around 8:30am, was able to snag a spot at the bar with no wait. 

Service was a bit lag, didn't get drink order or coffee refilled very quick, other than that experience was great."
3380,Hash House A Go Go,1,I was really looking forward to coming here after reading the review's and looking at the pictures. While the portions are huge including the kids meals the food wasn't great. I think the theme here is quantity over quality. I was in a party of 7 we each got something different 2 iteam from the kids menu. We all were very disappointed. I talked this place up from the review's and told everyone we must try it before we leave. Now I'm no longer able to choose the restaurant.
3381,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Been to this HH location a couple of times, most recently on 9/20/13. Service is usually just decent and there always seems to be a 20-30 minute wait - but the food and Bloody Marys make everything worth it! Portions are huge and you definitely get more than you pay for. 

I will say that food-wise, the hashes, pancakes, or French toast seem to be the way to go. I would avoid the breakfast meatloaf dish - while the mix as a whole was good (with potatoes, peppers, and cheese), the meatloaf itself didn't seem to fit into the meal as a whole and threw off the taste enough to make me wish I'd ordered something else."
3382,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Chicken and waffles were massive!  I had 3 waffles left but 10 years ago I would've finished it. 

We came in the morning for breakfast and it was Las Vegas busy!  In the evening, it was a Portland wait. 5mins and we were seated. 

My advice is to share their dishes. 2-3 people could share a dish easily. They give you these huge biscuits to start and you'll be full just eating that!"
3383,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great burgers and huge portions. Service was a bit slow but other than that great place while staying at the Linq
3384,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This restaurant is all about the big plate and large portion size American fare. We had a Veggie house hash and a flap jack for the two of us. We were not allowed to substitute 2 eggs for biscuits, or anything. The portion sizes were huge, big potatoes on the house hash and the flap jack was at least 12"" from end to end. Bloody Maria was great. 

The wait times were bad 30 minutes to be seated, then a horrible table by the kitchen needed a reseat, another 15 minutes, 15 minutes waiting for server, then 45 minutes waiting for food. 30+15+15+45= 1 hour 45 minutes for food and our food came out cold. 
We were starving and we ate our cold food, our server offered to help by remaking the food but we could not afford another 30-45 min wait. Server just said that is our average wait like that is whats to be expected, no other offer to help. We were highly recommended by our concierge, honestly we could have just gone to Dennys IMO."
3385,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My go to restaurant for breakfast when I visit Vegas. Always good food, service and drinks too! I always order a scramble...one of these days I will venture out! But I love the griddled mashed potatoes and the biscuit it comes with. My friend enjoyed the french toast. You will leave here with your stomach very full and happy!"
3386,Hash House A Go Go,2,"As a huge fan of the original hash house, not the one inside this casino, I was very disappointed. The staff was extremely friendly, that was a plus. But the food was cold, had obviously sat  for too long and was crusty. And honestly didn't taste good. I would've sent it back, but it took us forever to get the food in first place.  Plus there was a smell in the restaurant that seemed very unclean. I would try it again in hopes that it was an off day. But I would stick with the original."
3387,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Was super crowded.  HUGE portions, too much.  Salad overloaded with dressing. Sage fried chicken not so flavorful ."
3388,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Just visited this new location, and have been to the location on Sahara.

Food: GIANT portions. You should know that going in. Accept it and perhaps plan ahead to cut the plate in half, or maybe even in thirds.  I just had the chicken salad sandwich, so when it came out, I cut it in half; ate one half and took the other half home, which made great left overs.  It's definitely enough to share with two or three people.

I disagree with some of the reviews below. The food is good and very flavorful. It's greasy Midwestern food but not gross greasy.  Like I said, I had the chicken salad sandwich; it came with some delicious cucumbers and fries. The fries were seasoned just right and weren't too hard or crispy.

The place itself is nice, Americana midwest themed.  This location also has a great view of Las Vegas.  Once the weather warms up again it will be nice to eat on the terrace and enjoy the view.  We went on a Saturday afternoon -- around 4:30pm -- and there was zero line. (The Sahara location does have a longer wait.)  I didn't find the staff rude at all. They were very attentive and nice, and food came out quick.      

I think Hash House A Go Go is a definite must to visit. And if you're going to eat on/near the strip, this place is worth the money and time (which I don't think can be said of many other restaurants on the strip in the same price range)."
3389,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What a great place. We first saw it on Man VS Food. We were defiantly turned on buy the portion sizes. We were promptly sat as we walked in and instantly served by our waiter. My wife had a tractor driver with a pancake, I had a tractor driver with a waffle. The bacon was crispy and delicious, and the portions were even bigger then we imagined. And to top it all off we both had a giant glass of milk! The food was great, and our waiter was very prompt and courteous, and we only $33 (not including tip). We will be back!!"
3390,Hash House A Go Go,5,Worth the wait. Best breakfast place in Vegas. A unique spin on classic breakfast. I had the sage fried chicken and waffles. Yum. Yum. Yum. The hubby had the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was almost as good as mine. ;) Only downfall. No restrooms in restaurant. You have to go down to the casino. Kind of a drag.
3391,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the perfect end the night restaurant. I try to come here at least once when I'm in las Vegas. Beware the portions are HUGE! They look likea 4000 calorie beautiful nightmare. complete alcohol soaker, follows by a food coma."
3392,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is quite delicious, and the portions are huge. The drinks are colorful and delicious. I would highly recommend.

Only 4 stars though because of the hostess service. I came with a party of 8 and (not surprisingly) we had to wait. The hostess then gave our table to someone else and straight up lied to my face when I approached her about it. When she finally did sit us, she tried to separate my group into two separate tables. Our waitress was great though, and totally made up for it. She let us put the two tables together. When my food came out significantly later than the rest of my party's food... she comped me a drink."
3393,Hash House A Go Go,4,I liked my salmon scramble and crispy potatoes and hh Bloody Mary. Friendly fast efficient service. Open seating at the bar. Your receipt has a coupon for a future visit. Good deal. The coffee drinks looked good. Looking forward to going back.
3394,Hash House A Go Go,5,"At 2am, food was fresh and service was stellar. Located in the heart of the strip you really can't beat a hot meal during the wee hours of the night. I braved a breakfast skillet and my husband devoured the most ginormous pancake we've ever seen. I hear we need to go back for the Benedict and bloody Mary's.... Until the next time friends!"
3395,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Sage Fried Chicken Benedict . It was so good, i finished the whole thing by myself! 

Need something refreshing? try their watermelon drink (:"
3396,Hash House A Go Go,3,The food was mediocre at best. I bad never been here before and we can in for brunch. Without knowing just how large the portions are my boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken and waffles. When I say big portions I mean BIG PORTIONS. We could have shared one and literally still had left overs. I think if they worked on their recipes instead of their portions they would have better food. The waffles were decent but the fried chicken was Super dry.
3397,Hash House A Go Go,5,Definitely not to be missed especially if you are a foodie. The portions are not to be believed along with the tastes.
3398,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Amazing food, huge portions!! I mean huge the size of your ace huge. The server was great, the food delicious, yet the mimosas were ok."
3399,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I was so excited to eat here, but never got to taste the blackberry granola pancake I ordered.  When it was brought to the table (not by our server), I asked for butter, which was not brought until  I flagged another staff member.  They brought cold butter, but the pancake was already cold as well, and we ran out of time for me to even have it reheated.   Just a pathetic server.  She took our orders and brought coffee...and then we never saw her again until she brought the check.  We had to get a hostess to refill coffee.  We requested water, but never got it. It was just very poor customer service.  Disappointing.  I wouldn't give any stars at all, but yelp requires one so..."
3400,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Line was long during peak hours, but it was worth the wait.  Brunch tasted great, service was awesome, and the portion sizes are monstrous! 

I know, I know...  A bit wary considering it's inside presumably the dankest hotel in present day Vegas?  I would give it a shot (but be safe navigating through the casino, ha ha).

Best dish we tried that day was the eggs Benedict, the sauce was delightful with a bit of spice.  Least tasty dish was the rosemary chicken hash whatever - way too healthy, especially for Vegas.  If I'm going to eat out, I like me some flavor!"
3401,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This is a Hot Spot!! That being said we weren't expecting the amount of chaos involved in a popular place. The meals are gigantic and may actually have the power to cure any hangover however for those that were excited about the food and less the size it left much to be desired. Service was good on that they were working their best against a mad rush of tourists (us included). We waited 45 mins for a table. Another 40 for our food. Watched 2 tables get sat after us, eat, cash out and leave before we could even get our check. This could be reasonable if we ordered special menu items or had a huge party but we ordered basic meals off their signature menu. Glad we went for the experience but wouldn't repeat it."
3402,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was outstanding!! The portions were incredible!! The staff was very nice and helpful with the menu.  The food takes a moment because they make everything fresh and u might have to wait to get in but it's worth it!! Make sure u go hungry!!
3403,Hash House A Go Go,5,Seriously the best place to eat on the strip! Both the food and the service make this a must go to place. We could eat here every day and never be disappointed.
3404,Hash House A Go Go,1,The food looks tantalizing and we were virtually imagining every bite in our head as we waited 45 minutes and each time we saw the tables around us being served. Not sure if they lost are ticket or what happened to cause such a long wait. However by time we received the food it looked amazing but was lacking in excitement. We ordered chicken and waffles which ened up having bones. There needs to be a disclaimer warning you that there will be bones in your breakfast. The sage flavor was so overwhleming that we did not want to finish the dish. The chicken is a big part of the chicken and waffles dish and to have it be so dissapointing makes me not even want to give this place a 2nd chance especially after having to wait so long.
3405,Hash House A Go Go,4,The milkshake I ordered here was so good I ordered another one. It was sinfully good. The portions are huge here. Regular American food. Had a good time.
3406,Hash House A Go Go,4,One of the best brunches I have ever had !!! Portions are huge !!! My friend and I made the mistake of not sharing. The bloody Mary's looked awesome but drank to much previous night so couldn't try  definitely trying again. Wait was super long was able to sneak in seats at bar.  Not crazy about the Linq hotel but was there for restaurant.
3407,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I am sad to say that this location is nowhere close to being up to the standards and performance of the Sahara Location. 

We have been to the Sahara Location 4 or 5 times and Everything has been amazing. 
The two things that really through us off :
Sahara's Rib plate, has a mound of mashed horseradish mashed and then 2 big racks of ribs one going off of each side of the potato's. This makes sense for the $19 you pay. 

The Imperial Palace location: 

Mound of Horseradish potatoes that tasted like there was more horseradish then potato... It definitely made my eyes water. And we got about the same amount of ribs as the rib appetizer plate that my friend ordered. 
The Burger we bought was Dry... and they pounded out the meat so much that it was about 1/8 of an inch thick and was way to floppy.... And very very dry with not very much taste... I really hate to say it but my daughters grilled cheese sandwich was the best thing on our table.. 

Sorry hash house, Your Sahara location is always amazing, but as of now the Imperial palace location is way below par."
3408,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is an excellent place to go eat at a lot of food so bring your appetite and your family you can share with everyone the food was excellent I had waffles and chicken and it comes with sage and it it was good Services very excellent also the waiter and waitress took their time taking our order and the food came out very quickly
3409,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is amazing here. Be prepared to eat when coming here. The service is average for Vegas though
3410,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Pretty good food, environment was nice! My meal was ok, so many potatoes and not enough meat! However my father got the pot pie and it was scrumptious! Definitely would return but will be ordering something different! My husband had the biscuits and gravy and was very excited. Staff was friendly and extremely helpful!"
3411,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great breakfast/brunch spot. Worth the wait (about 40 minutes at 10 am on a weekday). We had a Bloody Mary and mimosa while we waited (you have to be assertive to get the attention of bartenders). Huge portions, lots of choices (seemed like lots of people were getting chicken and waffles), but we stuck with more traditional breakfast."
3412,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've been to HHAGG before and know that the portions are insane. Like, it's crazy how big they are. I wasn't looking to totally blow my macros on my first meal so, I kept it basic and, ordered the basic for breakfast :)

Food was hot, appetizing and service was a plus! Now, my sangria. It was probably the worst one I ever had. The only fruit in it was diced apples. What are thosssse!? Anyways, that's my only complaint. My mom loved this place so much she ate here 3x during our stay at the Linq. We went back for dinner at 4 and it didn't start until 5. I was really bummed about that so, I just got a side salad. Oh, my aunt really enjoyed the stuffed burgers but, as expected they're HUGE! Same for the pork tenderloin. Omg, I'm getting nauseous now thinking about the portions as I write this review. 

So, there you have it. The main take away is the portions. Ask for an extra plate and save yourself a tummy ache and a few dollars. You'll thank me later, I promise!"
3413,Hash House A Go Go,1,this place is disgusting. the food is gross - both in terms of how much they give you and how it tastes. the windowless interior adds nothing to the experience. I don't know why anyone would give this more than one star. i would like to give it negative stars if i could. it's a house of gross gluttony.
3414,Hash House A Go Go,5,I stayed at the linq and we conveniently found this restaurant. We had a few different meals here and they were all great! Kai was our waitress and loved her! She's very friendly and she is great at her job.
3415,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Food good, person who served us weak. Sadly, when I try to use a birthday special 2 for 1, sent by the Hash House A Go Go. They refused to honor it."
3416,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First of all, any place that's open 24 hours is already on my good side.

Located inside LINQ. 

H U G E portions and great food! I had never seen anything like this in my life. And it wasn't expensive. 

I ordered the Tractor Driver combo with brown sugar banana pancakes. I couldn't even get halfway through my meal but my babe finished his.

The guy John who waited on us was very nice. Loved his personality.

Happy we decided to try this place."
3417,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Of course this place is in Vegas.

It's a perfect fit. You walk in and it's outrageous! The food portions are outrageous! The food is part foodie, part stoner.

To be honest I wasn't blown away, the flavors were there but the fried chicken wasn't juicy enough and the biscuits were really dry. 

If you want to binge eat after a long drunken night of losing, this might be your spot!"
3418,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was sat quickly and the waiter was very helpful. A lot f dishes named the same thing but he helped distinguish what we really wanted. 

My wife thought it was far too spicy and could hardly eat and I had to try and finish it by myself. Couldn't do it. (SAGE FRIED CHICKEN). I thought it was all very well prepared and quite delicious. It was actually too much food for my hang over but I needed that. 

Ambiance was casual and it was a nice relaxing (FILLING) brunch before going back to the strip. Just be cautious if you're sensitive to spicy food."
3419,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went around 9am, we were told a 35 minute wait and they got us seated in about  15 minutes. 

Food portions are HUGE! Could honestly be split by two adults. 

Our server Mike has been there for 13 years and he knew so much about the menu making it easy for us to decide what we wanted. 

The food was QUALITY, the service was fast and the environment was great. It is a louder environment but lots of excitement for breakfast."
3420,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The meatloaf sandwich I had was good but I will never ever come back. Here's why. i got there at 11pm and asked for a take out. There were only a few parties in there, but it took 40 minutes for me to get my food. There were 2 ladies that got there way before me and they hadn't gotten their food either. They wanted to leave and demanded that their undelivered food to be taken off of their bill but the staff was giving them a such a difficult time. So lame."
3421,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came here around 8am on a Saturday. There was queue but we were seated very quickly. It was a very nice restaurant with good food at affordable price, but our waiter, Sky, ruined our day. Here's the story:

After being seated for 10 minutes and waving my hand for 5 minutes no one came to take our order, so I had to ask a cleaner to get a waiter for us. Finally one waiter came, but he purposely ignored us and walked to a different table to talk to them (even though that table clearly didn't ask for him). Then he slowly came over, without introducing himself, and asked us what we wanted. I asked him how are you doing? He replied, ""just feeling RUSHED BY YOU, otherwise doing fine"". 

After we ordered, we waited for 30 minutes but nothing came. Even 2 tables that came in 10 minutes after us got their food. I had to leave my table and grab him to ask him what happened to our order. He replied, ""I have many other tables to take care of, and your dessert takes about 20 mins to prepare"". 1. Did we ever say that we want the dessert to be served at the same time as the main dishes? 2. We waited for 30 mins already! 3. Is he cooking our food? No. So why is him being busy making our food slow? Makes absolutely no sense. Since he never introduced himself, I asked him his name. The jerk LIED to me and said that his name was SCOTTY, but later I heard that he told other tables his name was SKY. 

By the time we got our food, the table that came 10 mins later than us already FINISHED their meal and left. We spent 2 hours without enjoying ourselves because of this one waiter. Hash House really needs to fire this guy so as not to waste the efforts of the chefs and other waiters/ waitresses.

Watch out for this guy: we still don't know his REAL NAME. It could be SKY or SCOTTY or something else. He's a short, white guy. Avoid him all you can if they haven't fired him."
3422,Hash House A Go Go,1,"ONE OF THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE.  We were drawn to Hash House A Go Go because we saw it on Man Vs. Food and our jaws dropped and we had to go!  We were visiting Las Vegas for our wedding so we (my husband and I) had my parents and two friends along for breakfast.  The wait was insane, 1 hour and 15 mins, but we waited because we wanted to eat there so bad!  We sat, orders taken, beverages arrived- then we were ignored.  We were mesmerized at the huge plates walking past and our mouths drooled with excitement for our meal.  My father needed a water refill and the server completely soaked his entire leg and then preceded to attempt to help him dry off but then left and never came back to check on him or give him another napkin.  Food starts to arrive- 4 out of us got our food and my 2 friends were plate-less.  Finally after about 5 minutes of wondering what the heck is going on we flag down someone to find our server.  After about 5 mins she appears and we ask her where their food was...  Her reply, ""It just comes out when it's ready.""  Our response, ""That would've been nice to know...""  No apology???  After waiting another 10 mins and their food still had not arrived, the rest of us were done eating.  The food was good, but at this point it didn't matter if it was the best thing I ever ate...  I felt HORRIBLE for my friends whom had woken up at 6am and flew in that day- it was 1pm and they still had not eaten.  At this point they had no desire to pay for a meal that they weren't going to be able to enjoy with the rest of us.  The ""trying to find our server process"" ensued again...  Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock...  Order canceled, asked for check...  Waiting, Waiting, Waiting...  Check Dropped- I couldn't stand it and had to get out of there for a minute and took my time going all the way downstairs to use the restroom, upon arriving back at the table- she still hadn't been back to pick up the card to run it.  All 6 of us headed up to the front and finally got the host to find the server to run the card which was SERIOUSLY 10 minutes of waiting for that while I watched her run around the restaurant, take orders, do what ever- knowing that we were in the lobby OBVIOUSLY wanting to leave.  Signed the slip and asked for the manager.  I explained (the above) adding- ""I just want to inform you because it is pretty obvious that you were unaware that we even had an issue at our table because it was very apparent that we were NOT happy with our experience.""  Manager, ""Yeah I didn't know anything about it, guess I'll need to go talk to her.""  After 15+ years in customer service and 10+ years serving and managing restaurants...  This was in the top 3 of WORST experiences that I've ever had dining out.  HORRID!!!  And...  It was so lovely to see that $86 debit out of my banking account the next day- The manager should've done SOMETHING to make it right.  This place is total BS."
3423,Hash House A Go Go,4,I am a connoisseur of breakfast/brunch and bloody Marys and they have pretty good of both. You will wait for a table and you will get the largest plate of food ever.
3424,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of The Quad. They're open 24hrs so if it's late in the night, this is one of the options you have. Decor is rustic with a lot of farming decorations.

Our Order:
Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict: ($16.99) sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled Mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled Eggs served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes
Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower: ($17.50) Sage Fried Chicken stacked w/ bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks
Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade: $5.50
Iced Pistachio Mocha: $6.99

WARNING: Portions here are HUGE!! It wasn't on Man vs. Food for a reason! I totally forgot how large the dishes are here and ordered too much as we were starving. First thing that came out of my mouth as it was placed in front of us, ""OMG. What did we just do?!"" As we were trying to tackle the dishes, we were watching other tables make the same mistake as we did and to hear their gasps were hilarious. We and most of the tables around us had to take the remainder of our orders to go. You have been warned!

I wasn't a fan of the fried chicken that they're so famous for as I didn't really taste the sage and the batter was really thick. Since the chicken is covered in sauces, it's not going to be crispy so it's basically a bunch of mush when you dig into it. I had ordered the Waffle Tower and was surprised that the bacon was actually INSIDE the waffle! I thought it would be layered between the waffles or bits sprinkled around.. but nope! Very nicely toasted so it had the slight crunch that I enjoy in my waffles (but still soft and airy on the inside). I also liked the biscuit in the Chicken Benedict as it was quite flavorful, soft, and slightly crumbly. Both dishes were merely ok in their entirety though.

In the Iced Pistachio Mocha, you're able to taste the pistachio but since I love the flavor, I would've liked it if it was stronger. It's mostly a sweet drink though so wouldn't say it's strong in the caffeine department. 

What I'd definitely would come back for is the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade. It's so refreshing and sounds like a weird combination, but it's so good! I had the non-alcoholic version but next time I'll try their alcoholic one (if it's not too early in the day though).

The waitress that assisted us was cheery and friendly. We came here on a Friday afternoon around 2PM so it wasn't very crowded. Fairly easy to flag someone down when we needed something.

Having tried their famous dishes, I wouldn't order them again as there are so many other options to try. Hopefully I'll remember to share a dish the next time I come though!"
3425,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good spot to cure a hangover! Portions are huge, I ordered the tractor driver with one brown sugar banana pancake and barely ate a quarter of it. Could easily feed 2-3 people. The pancake was absolutely delicious though! Place is crazy busy and very hectic, but service was good considering."
3426,Hash House A Go Go,5,Unbelievably this is probably one of the best breakfasts in Las Vegas.  We love this place and you have no reason to walk away hungry.
3427,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Warning portions are HUGE people enough to share with someone. Especially the chicken and waffles. The chicken was good love the crunch but lacked seasoning for me . You guys need to add a little lawry seasoning and cayenne pepper to the batter lol. Love the crunch on the skin. The waffle had bacon bake into it so freaking good. My husband liked his pancake bigger than the plate lol.  The sausage was good,  my husband order an apple juice omg he couldn't stop saying how good it was so fresh. I didn't like the monosa one it was served in a regular glass thumbs now second the orange was too fresh killed the champagne. Next time we in Vegas we shall return for more food ."
3428,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service was great, but was not impressed with the food, Waffles were very dry and chicken didn't have much flavor.  I went in with high expectations based on reviews but left un-impressed."
3429,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was amazing enough for me and my friends to go to twice in a row! The waiter was quirky and funny, and also very friendly :) He recognized us the second time we came too (""Oh, long time no see!"") We heard about the giant portions of Hash House, and we starved ourselves accordingly. Still, we could only order 3 plates for 6 people :\ Be warned that there it is $2.50ish for every extra PLATE they put on the table for sharing! So with both days, we ordered:

Chicken and waffles: AMAZING. A-MAAAAA-ZINGGGGGG!!!!!! We ordered this twice because it was so good! Big bacon strips cooked right INTO the waffle and sticking out at all sorts of delicious angles! Not too sweet to overpower, yet not too salty to be weird. YUM. I could eat a whole plate by myself! The chicken was not bad either, though alone I felt that it was a bit bland. The fried green onions around it also gave the dish a great zing!

Chicken benedict: Not really a benedict, as there is no hollandaise sauce. Instead, it is a creamy chipotle sauce that my friends LOVED. They actually ordered extra sauce ($1.95) and cleaned it COMPLETELY. The benedict was very filling, but also good...I'm just not really sure what I ate aside from the chicken and the biscuit or something...

Meatloaf: Holy mother of pearl this was GOOD! Meatloaf was tender and held together just right! The potatoes were also very delicious and the green beans were cooked to a nice delicate crunchy perfection! Carrots were meh, but no one's complaining with the rest of the dish! Tip: Meatloaf tastes ORGASMIC with the chipotle cream sauce!

Chicken pot pie: This was very good as well. Light and a teensy bland/plain compared to the other dishes, but still good in its own right. My friend busted out the tabasco to spice it up, and I put in a bit more salt and pepper. Chicken was moist, and the chunks of potato and veggies were all cooked just right. Only thing was that the biscuit was hard as a rock. I think I finally broke one with my teeth and a part of the biscuit flew out and near hit the person across from me. I don't mind too much though as the rest of the dish (and the other dishes) were so good.

Pancake, scrambled eggs, potatoes: The pancake is GIANT! The godfather of all pancakes! It was probably 5 normal IHOP pancakes (make that 6 or 7) clumped together and stacked with another 6 or 7 pancakes! Not as delicious as the waffle IMO, but definitely a WOW factor. The pancake had a good taste, but at some points it did feel like it was way too thick for me (not what she said). Not much to say on the eggs (they were normal?), but the potatoes had this weird crunchiness which made us wonder if it was leftover fried potatoes from breakfast/lunch...seemed to be re-fried or something. Both eggs and potatoes need more salt, but I honestly just wouldn't order this dish. Why get pancakes when you got CHICKEN AND WAFFLES?!?

Overall? Mouthgasm. It was funny seeing my guy friends just put a bite in their mouth, sit back, and siiiiiiiiiiiiigh. Definitely come here when you stop by Vegas! Oh, and as for pricing...this was essentially all-you-can-eat as there was SO MUCH FOOD and you definitely need to share! Total for both times (again, 5-6 people, 3 dishes) came out to be around $15 WITH tip/tax+2 extra sauces. Great deal for delicious food in giant portions!"
3430,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is an amazing place for breakfast! Big portions, tasty and flavorful food and great mimosa. Also the service is fantastic, totally recommended. Try the cappuccino!"
3431,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Loved this place. We went here for brunch and were seated pretty quickly.

Food: We got the omelets. Highly recommend getting the home fries instead of mashed potatoes. The fruit salad is pretty much 2 slices of fruits (cantaloupe and orange). The quantity is huge for the price.

Service: Really good.

Ambience: Casual, but gloomy. No windows."
3432,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best place the eat breakfast after a long night out in Vegas! Highly recommend any of their fried chicken breakfast and their Bloody Mary! I eat here every time I come to Vegas!
3433,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Not gonna lie, I went here just for the sage fried chicken eggs benedict because I saw it on Man vs. Food..... HOLY COW!!!

The food was incredible and the service, outstanding. The pieces of fried chicken was huge and delicious! If it was just the fried chicken, I would still think it is absolutely amazing. Very flavorful. There was fried mozzarella cheese on it... I love fried cheese. They thought of everything! There is some spinach and some tomatoes that compliments the dish very well. The bacon is crunchy and the creamy chipotle sauce on it was outstanding!!

I would say that the only disappointment was that they use scramble eggs instead of poached eggs. My girlfriend had a dish with roasted chicken in it.. not good at all. She didn't even finish it, and didn't even eat it as leftovers afterwards. 

go here... get the sage fried chicken eggs benedict; you will thank me"
3434,Hash House A Go Go,5,How dare people not give Hash House 5 stars. This place is awesome. Huge portions of high quality food. If you don't like the Sage chicken with grilled cheese and chiptole cream sauce... there's something wrong with you.
3435,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love this place! Great bargain considering how exorbitantly large the portions are. Quality-wise, it just is what it is: yummy diner food.  And the servers have always been helpful and attentive.  Initially I saw a crowd of people waiting just outside the entrance of the restaurant, so I was anticipating a long wait, but the hostess informed me that it would only be a 10-15 minute wait (awesome). There's a bartender that serves Bloody Mary's and such while you wait, so you can a head start on drinking (also awesome).  I got the sage chicken (because it was featured on MvF) and it didn't disappoint. I barely finished a quarter of my food, but it tasted great as leftovers too. Expect to feel a good 5 lbs heavier after your meal... maybe plan a walk down the strip to help digest.

This is just one of those places you have to experience so that you can say you went there. Which is made obvious when you sit down at your table and look around to see everyone take a picture of their dish so that they can post it on Facebook with some subtitle along the lines of ""hey guys, look at my huge plate of food!!!"""
3436,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very good breakfast spot at Vegas. Every time I come here I always order their infamous pancakes. The pancake is almost as big as half of the table. There is no way two people can eat this. This gigantic pancake is good to share between five or six people. There are also so many options to choose from like pumpkin (my fave), blueberry (second fave), banana, and so much more. Along with the pancake, I usually order a skillet or platter option like eggs, hash potatoes, and bacon. They also offer Vegas style drinks that seem like they're about two feet tall in a festive bottle and straw. This place is always slammed so expect wait time. It's worth the wait though!"
3437,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When we first came to this restaurant, there was a long line of people on the outside of the restaurant, waiting. We were expecting a wait time of around 30 minutes, but in 10 minutes, we were in the restaurant. We ordered the watermelon lemonade (non alchoholic), their famous chicken and waffles, and their fried pork tenderloin sandwich. The watermelon lemonade was okay, it was slightly sweet with lots of watermelon pulp at the bottom. You had to mix it with a straw to have the perfect sip. Both the chicken and waffles and the pork tenderloin sandwich were massive. The chicken and waffles consisted of two giant pieces of chicken on top of four waffles on the bottom. The chicken was very crisp, tender, and juicy, and the waffles were very soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. The waffles even had bacon baked into them, which was a huge plus. The pork tenderloin sandwich was massive. The size of the fried pork tenderloin itself was four times the size of the bread that held it. The pork tenderloin was very crisp on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside, just like the fried chicken on the waffles. All of the food combined could feed a small army. Will definitely be coming back."
3438,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Figured I had to try this place because of all the hype surrounding it! Walking in I even noticed all of the signed celebrity menus lining the wall (including my all time favorite lush, Holly Madison) and thought that I was in for a huge treat. When I got my water there was what appeared to be an egg yolk stuck to the inside of the glass, and my waiter replaced it without even apologizing... I ordered the portobello burger and quite honestly, it was lacking in flavor. I feel as if they don't even marinate them, they're just kind of slapped on the burger. The pesto was delicious, although overpowering. The pesto should accentuate the flavor of the portobello, not the other way around. :( The bun was extremely thick and bready, and therefore I took off one of the bun halves. My mom ordered the veggie hash, which was absolutely delicious. Long story short, focus more on quality instead of quantity!"
3439,Hash House A Go Go,5,I love the sage Chicken and Waffles omggggggg. Went on that Friday morning and went back again that Saturday
3440,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Stopped by the Hash House recently and not sure what all the fuss about this place is.
Came in for breakfast before our flight home and as expected there was a wait for tables but only about ten minutes, not too bad, just a bit nerve wracking when one has a deadline.
First, the good: The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable and knew the products, when the food arrived the portions were generous to say the least. The meals were delivered quickly and correctly even though we had asked for a few changes. Our waitress, Bree, was smart, funny and was able to offer good recommendations.
The not as good: The food is only so-so. Portion size does not make up for meals that are haphazardly prepared. The waffles and French toast were neither crispy or especially tasty. The signature fried chicken was expertly cooked (very juicy and tender) but without the skin lacked any flavor of any kind, it would have benefitted greatly from brining, although I realize that this may not be possible for a high volume restaurant. The bacon was well cooked but suffered from what must have been a long hold time. It had lost its crispiness and had moved more towards leather which added a strange flavor.
Bottom line: I would return if for no other reason than it was a decent value in a city that doesn't always deliver on that promise as well as to try a few more selections."
3441,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Totally overrated.

I've had only the famous chicken waffle. On the site Benedict is $15,  ok; then chicken waffle looks good, $19, alright; then after ordered, $25. 

And the signature big portion? 2 chicken breasts, and all you can eat (4) waffle. WTF? I paid a KFC bucket family meal's price for 2 pieces of chicken breast? It was good but dude, fried chicken is fried chicken.

Service was not good either, it was a pickup order and they must figure I don't need my food served fresh and hot, so gave me a cold prepared box. And pay for parking if you dine in? This is such a joke, I get diner buffet at LINQ for this price ok?

Was from a Vegas bucket list, scratched off all the remaining ""buckets""."
3442,Hash House A Go Go,2,Do not try the streak here. It is not good. I am still grateful to find a place that's open late night. My colleague tried their banana crusted pancake and was pleasantly surprised by the quality though.
3443,Hash House A Go Go,5,My wife and I went there for a late lunch  I ordered the bbblt  and my wife ordered  the radish salad  with  cucumber ranch  dressing. The bbblt was real good and jay  the server even said that  was one of his  favorite sandwiches on the menu  and he the salad that my wife ordered was awesome too the cucumber dressing. Was even better  and the taste was real  refreshing  too. I'd like to go back again  and again ..
3444,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The food took over 40 minutes to come out and the biscuits and gravy and sausage were dry and not hot. An eggs ""Benedict"" (didn't have hollandaise sauce) had a spicy sauce which I didn't want. I ask to have a different sauce and was charged without notice.  All in all, not impressed."
3445,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was an excellent meal. Only thing is cost of a dinky orange juice was $3.95! Would've almost been better off to but a beer. 

That being said, this place has awesome food and portions are very generous! Had the Goshen Scramble, with farm fresh eggs and some weird name sausage, but it was very yummy and tasty!

Will be coming back definitely!"
3446,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yum! Yum! Yum! 4 of us shared 2 meals, they are HUGE portions!!!! Great service. Super long wait time. We sent the guys early to put our name on the list. An hour wait! BLT Bloody Mary was yummy!"
3447,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was so awesome. I got a bacon avocado scramble with a side of gravy and the blt Bloody Mary. My husband got chicken and waffles (which was massive, we could've split it) and their nitro coffee (that kept us both going until we could check into our room). It was packed when we were there, wait staff was still outstanding."
3448,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just visited Hash House A GO Go inside the Linq hotel. Had some amazing food. We had 20 people in our group. Everyone loved their food, but just as much as the food, we loved our service. Lou and Halle were an amazing duo along with a couple other teammates. Some of the best servers I've had in a long time. Lou, you're awesome."
3449,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent food with lots of flavor. I ordered the man vs food. OmG its soo good. Had to tag team.it with my son and we still got conquered we couldnt finish it. Servers and workers are friendly and nice. Be patience alot of people. Truat me itnia worth the wait. Enjoy....
3450,Hash House A Go Go,3,"first of all, the service was excellent. but why 3 stars? because overall i liked the food but i didnt love it. so it was a 4 star to begin with. the chicken was juicy but i feel like the waffle itself could be a bit crispy. i still like it though!

what makes me wouldn't go back was cause i waited for my food for almost an hr. seriously considered i was in vegas, i think that's a no go. have i known id be waiting that long i'd be long gone to another restaurant already...:(

i still gotta say the staff there were very very friendly and helpful!"
3451,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of the best breakfasts in Vegas!

We were lucky that there was no wait when we ate there. The hype is true, you won't be able to finish your pancakes here. I had the blueberry & pecan pancakes and they did not disappoint. Whole, real blueberries and pecans in pancakes isn't something you want to pass up. 

I had the bloody mary and no pre-made mix here.  It was spicy without being too salty, just right.  They even puree the tomatoes fresh for each drink.

Service was great and fast, they refilled my coffee and water right on time. Waitress was really friendly too. 

If you eat breakfast here you won't be hungry til at least dinner!"
3452,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is the only place I will eat at the Imperial Palace. The other places in this casino make me cringe. The food is great and with so many options that sound so good you will have a tough time deciding on what you want. The portions would make any dietitian sick to their stomach but will fill yours. Very good food, nice servers and clean location. If you are solo or 2-3 of ya try sitting at the bar to bypass the line if there is one."
3453,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Bring an appetite! Not only was their food great, their mimosas were awesome! Wait is rather long but worth it."
3454,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is the best. We were in Vegas for only 3 days and we traveled a mile on foot twice to eat here. We would have traveled much further because this place is worth it. The prices may seem a little steep but the portions are huge which makes the value amazing. I ordered the fried chicken benedict and I had two full meals on it. The meals have a ton of carbs in them. This place will load you up on bread and potatoes but the food is delicious. It is best for everyone at the table to order something different and share.
3455,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is definitely worth the five stars. Amazing service, and even better food. Portions are HUGE and will leave you feeling full and satisfied upon leaving. Came here twice in one day to get the burger stuffed with mashed potatoes and wow. Was a good I had to eat it in one sitting. And immediately took a nap after. Tried to crispy salmon today and wow. No words or pictures can describe the awesomeness."
3456,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I really like this place! I went twice during my most recent venture to Las Vegas and my taste buds were pleased, lol. My first meal was the chicken and waffles...yummm. The waffles had sliced bacon cooked right in and the chicken was fried and seasoned perfectly. The second time I went I ordered something completely different...the egg scramble with spinach and cubed ham with a side of potatoes, fresh fruit and a biscuit. The biscuit wasn't dry at all, I added a little honey to it and it was dynamite! I can't wait to go again!"
3457,Hash House A Go Go,5,WOW.... This is why America is the greatest country in the world. Chicken and Waffles.. The Chicken Sage Benedict... both are beautiful large portions of a meal. Go with an appetite. This is by far my new favorite place in Vegas.
3458,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portions as big as two of your heads! 

I've been here a few times on various Vegas excursions and each time I left overly stuffed and satisfied.    They don't mess around with portion sizes.  This is not a place for those with tiny appetites.  

On one trip, I had the HH Famous Meatloaf Hash and my wife ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  Both were pretty good.   The meatloaf wasn't the juiciest meatloaf, but had a good taste.   The chipotle sauce for the benedict was yummy.  

More recently, I went with my wife and a couple of friends.  The table shared a blueberry, pecan, brown sugar pancake, 2 orders of the pork tenderloin benedict, and a quesadilla.   

The pancake was sweet, soft but not undercooked, and ginormous.  I really don't know how one person can put that platter of fluffyness down themselves.  

The pork tenderloin was breaded and fried to a nice crispness but I think I would have been happy with a big slab of un-breaded/fried pork.  Perhaps I would have appreciated the fried-ness if I were hungover.  :)

I only had a bite of the quesadilla and I remember it being very quesadilicious. 

the lines can get backed up during the late morning brunch time, but if you are a total rewards member (platinum or higher), there's a separate faster line.

Don't plan on having phone reception there.  My phone (ATT) had no service for most of the time, and other carriers struggled with weak signals."
3459,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions of quite tasty food.  The biscuits and gravy is tasty, though the ratio of gravy could be higher.  Great friendly service but really really slow kitchen.  Waited nearly an hour for our food which is quite long for essentially diner food."
3460,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg I love this place so much. Went twice in just 4 days while in Vegas and then pretty much daydreamed about it the next week after I returned home 
Our server was great and helpful warning us about the huge portions which he was not exaggerating! It was awesome having leftovers though to snack on when we got back to our room after being out on the strip walking so much  I had some French toast with cinnamon whipped cream and walnuts oh it was amazing 
The other time I had a chicken dish with mashed potatoes, so delicious 
there's still much more in the menu I want to try haha."
3461,Hash House A Go Go,2,"First, You need to wait 20 minutes to get seats, then the nightmare just begins.  We waited for 1 hour to get our food. Besides, the food is not worth the wait time."
3462,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went for breakfast and almost turned around because the line was long, I'm so glad I stayed. It turned out, the wait time was only 5 minuets.  Hash House has a Large breakfast menu to choose from and very large portions and with reasonable prices.  The food is delicious and I couldn't finish even half.  The bacon mashed potatoes were fantastic but the highlight was the amazing BLT Bloody Mary.   Our server Amanda was great and made several recommendations and knew the menu very well.  With so many restaurants in Vegas, this has to be on your list."
3463,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing food. French toast! Worth the wait for the food and always super busy!  Try to find out when it is the least busiest or you will be waiting a long time!
3464,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I've probably had more bad meals in Vegas than anywhere else in the world. Let's face it the food quality overall in Vegas sucks.

This place is just another example of an over hyped, underwhelming Vegas eatery.

I could only eat about 1/4 of my plate (not because of the portion (it was tiny), but because it was disgusting) and I was not alone. I was sitting at the counter and plate after plate of barely touched meals were heading straight to the trash bin.

If you've got the drunk breakfast munchies, take my advice and head over to the Denny's. You'll save yourself about 50% and will be less disappointed.

Simply disgusting."
3465,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Their food here is massive! The service here is superb! The food is good just a lottttt, you have to come really hungry and share share share. We seriously over ordered the food we couldn't finish it all.

We came here early for breakfast there was about a 20 minute wait which wasn't too bad. We were seated and served by a very pleasant woman I wish I knew her name because she was just the most patient and wonderful server I have come across.

I had to order their famous sage chicken, let's just say this bad boy was just too much I couldn't see myself ordering this again but it was good don't get me wrong. It had butter milk biscuits, bacon, spinach, tomatoes, sage fried chicken, scrambled eggs, mozarella cheese and chipotle creme on top. It was really good but we weren't able to finish it between the 2 of us it just was a lot of food and the bacon was a little overkill for me.  This was featured on Man Vs. Food. Let's just say it won. :) 

We also ordered the brown sugar pancakes which were really good they had bananas also. Their kids menu their french toast portion is so big too, they brought out 2 big pieces of french toast topped with banana, butter and powdered sugar. Their french toast is really good. I really enjoyed their french toast.

All in all a wonderful experience, you definitely must try and like I said before Come Hungry!"
3466,Hash House A Go Go,2,"First off, kinda hard to find if you don't know where you are going. This place is located on the tip floor. You must find the ONE escalator that goes to it, which is located in the middle of the casino. Randomly. 
Anyways, the plates are huge as are the portion sizes, but that is really all this place as going for it. I got a Hash House Quesadilla stuffed with potatoes, jalapenos, eggs & tomato with a chili cream. Ew. Why did I think this was going to be good? This thing was potatoes, really, not much else, smothering in this chili cream that was so not tasty.
But I came back. For the Snickers pancake. Which is a pancake, with Snickers pieces in it. Not original or very creative. Not very good either. The griddle makes the good part of the candy melt, and leaves behind a stick to your teeth part."
3467,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The service was great. The food was overrated. Bigger in not better. Salmon hash involved shredded sweet smoked salmon with cold cubes of cream cheese on top. I ordered fresh tomatoes on the side which i added. That brightened up the dish some. But, still I had better breakfasts at other places on the strip for half the price."
3468,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I gave it a four because of their portions.  A ****three*** for food. Average of three stsrs for me. I ordered the corned beef. Thos eas very yummy, but when i got to the sunny side up eggs, the they tasted like rust. I guess its because the food comes in a cast iron and it was a bit rusted. Maybe not good for your health.  As far as the place,  the service was ok. The bathrooms were outside the restaurant. There were no restrooms inside. This was kind of a pain as they were located downstairs away from the restaurant."
3469,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Nomnomnomnomlicious...

Hash House is a solid restaurant at The Quad (formerly known as Imperial Palace) which opens late...or maybe even 24 hours (not sure on that). Every single dish here serves in large quantity. If you fancy a pancake with the size of your face + head, you will be happy here. 

We came here on the night before our wedding with my family. There were 10 of us and service was top notch. Food came out hot and tasty. A few of us have burgers and they looked mighty delicious. I had an Omelette with all the fixins and I was a happy camper.

I love  Hash House, but I don't love the smokey filling of the place. It was on the top floor of The Quad and if you've ever been to Vegas you know how tight and smokey The Quad is. If you've never been to Vegas..well The Quad only has one smell which is Ciggys smell. 

We will be back whenever we are in Vegas for more late night giant food munching."
3470,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you get off a plane in Vegas and haven't eaten in 10 hours and want brunch + drinks then come here. 
We found this place based on proximity and reviews and were not disappointed. I was a little nervous that there were so many people waiting and thought it was going to take forever but it didn't. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Although I'm a little sad they don't do a bottomless brunch the drinks food and service definitely made up for that. Everything was delicious and even with it being absolutely packed we didn't wait long for anything at all."
3471,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Better experience than my last time in Vegas but still not as good as the one in San Diego. Food is average but extra star for convenience of being on the hotel and 24 hours.
I got the stuffed burger with Mac and cheese as a side and that ended up being the star of the meal. The waitress was a little slow and it wasn't even busy. They have a new way of paying thru individual mini iPads however the tip varies from the printed bill vs the machine which is kinda sketch so keep your eye out when you are paying."
3472,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Like I like my chicken!

- The wait was only about 10-15 minutes so it wasn't too bad! 
- John was a very fast and a great multitasker (hopefully that was his name). It's the one that was on the receipt!
- The food is priced fairly high, but I can see why.. their portions are large is an understatement. 
- This was featured on Man vs. Food! Layer of biscuit with tomato, spinach, smoked bacon, griddled mozzarella, and chipotle cream scrambled eggs with mash potatoes!
- The crispy chicken is really good and fried for that good flavorful sauce they drizzled. I can't complain about anything except their mash potatoes could've been done better. It was quite clumpy. I guess eat your food fast or else it'll get soggy. 
- I'd go back if I were really hungry... this brunch/breakfast was so massive!"
3473,Hash House A Go Go,4,Never disappoints. First time at the Vegas location. It's open 24/7 which I like. Had pork tenderloin sandwich and French toast tracker. Portions are huge!
3474,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I stayed at the Linq during my visit to Las Vegas and HH a go go was located in the hotel so I had to stop by the hyped restaurant. A friend and I went on a Friday morning and it was packed and the wait was 45 minutes. We were seated but weren't greeted by our server for a while. I went with the basic (potatoes, eggs, toast, fruit) and my friend went with the chicken hash. It was pretty normal nothing crazy. Portion size was massive for both of us. I'd recommend sharing a dish with someone as it is impossible to finish the dish in one sitting. It'd be silly to take it to you because it would be soggy and unappetizing when you are hungry again. I personally feel this place is overhyped and I'd rather go to IHOP."
3475,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh my goodness!!! Hash House A Go Go is all that is amazing!! Such great food!!! My sister, cousin and I each got a small side salad and then split the mountain O fried chicken/benedict type thing. It tasted amazing!! We couldn't even finish it with 3 of us going at it!!! I swear, I will come back to Vegas just to go to this restaurant again! So yummy and our waiter was the nicest and funniest guy! Great time there!"
3476,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm not usually one to post yelp reviews but this place deserves one.  Billy was our server and Tiffany was our bartender; both were amazing.  Seriously, props to both of them- amazing people.  The food was great and huge portions.  Come hungry!  I will definitely be back the next time we come to Vegas!"
3477,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great breakfast- large portions but perfect after a night out.  Bloody Mary so so but coffee was good
3478,Hash House A Go Go,3,"All the hype for this restaurant isn't just hype. I would rather give it 4 stars but the quantity is so much that I feel it is unhealthy. The food is really good but you'd have to be super hungry to finish half your meal cuz if you finished your entire plate you would be suffering the rest of the day and possibly the night. So if you are a big eater than this is definitely the spot for you. Place was crowded but was big enough to handle it. Wait time was about 27 minutes. Wait time for food matches the wait time to sit. Prolly a must try. My daughter had a pancake and it was like the worlds biggest pancake. She only ate at most a third. I had some fried chicken , Man vs Food challenge food, atop biscuits atop potatoes mixed with bacon slices a vegetables. Huge! I finished a good third and left the rest. We felt bad leaving so much food behind. Well, I hope this helps."
3479,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place gets on one TV show and everyone loses their minds.
This place is mediocre at best.
Always busy because there is lack of diners and breakfast specific places in Las Vegas.
Overpriced for bland quality.
MEH"
3480,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Incredible! Arrived at 10AM on a Thursday, no wait, seated immediately. Food was outstanding, I recommend splitting a dish between at least two people. Very fresh, fast and delicious"
3481,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow bring an appetite ! These portions are HUGE! I had the corned beef hash skillet and it was a 8 -10 in pan filled with hash potatoes peppers cheese 2 eggs and a giant biscuit that was to die for .  My wife had a scramble with chicken eggs peppers and cheese she also got a biscuit with comes with a side of homemade peach jam and some soft spreadable butter. Man vs food was here and the dish that he tried is enough for 4 people to split.not only are the portions huge but so is the flavor and quality of the food. All made to order and the staff was great recommending items or just letting you know their favorites. The Coffee was hot and fresh and I could barley finish my meal . If your looking for a hungry mans breakfast after a long day of hitting the tables this is the spot you won't be sorry and you won't leave hungry
3482,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Open 24/7, the Hash House A Go Go will feed your Vegas cravings anytime. I saw their original location in San Diego on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives but didnt make it when in town. I honestly didn't even know there was one here, so this was a pleasant surprise.

We initially encountered what we felt was a very large line to get in, even for a Sunday morning. We didn't mind the wait and the patrons of varying party sizes we're being seated rather quickly.

I ordered the chicken and waffles and as hungry as I was, it was definitely not a one man job. Lots of great tasting chicken and prefectly cooked waffles. Not sure when I'll be back, but I'm looking at the bacon waffles, famous flapjacks or sage fried chicken benedict next time. Just remember to come hungry."
3483,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First things first!!!  The Portions are HUGE.
We had chicken and waffles along with a salad. Both tasty.  Nothing to die over but very good.

The staff was playful and friendly."
3484,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We tried to come here around 11am Friday morning and the line was wayyyyyyy too long. That's a good sign. It means the food is good. However we decided to try again since we're staying at the Linq, it's literally a quick walk over.

Now it's 4am Saturday and it's not packed at all. Still enough people but no wait. We ordered to go since our room wasn't far. Because of the late night hour the menu is different. Still breakfast & dinner options available. I was going to order ""The Basic"" but there's no non pork breakfast meat. I don't eat pork so I settled for option B. I got the brown sugar banana flap jack. Man that thing is huge! 

It came in a pizza box, literally. Idk how I'm going to even eat half of it. And it only cost $10. That's not too shabby. 2 people could split it. I sure wish I had help lol."
3485,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food and service was great! Definitely bring your appetite! Highly recommend the Sage fried chicken & waffles... they beat Roscoe's, hands down. As busy as it was, our server was very attentive. Expect to take a to-go box out the door. Will come back for sure!"
3486,Hash House A Go Go,2,"It's an interesting place. Get there early or you're gonna wait. What it really boils down to is that it's A LOT of ""just okay"" food. None of us barely made a dent in it and we weren't super impressed with the quality."
3487,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Big appetite portions not for the weak. Great food and fusions. Farm sizes on your plate no doubt! The ideas of how they concocted arranged their plates are amazing. A great place for big groups and kids and families. For a first date? Not unless u dont wanna impress ur date, go ahead and munch away with this! Expect to wait, but know that it is worth it. Have an alcoholic beverage while you're at it. Wait time is mostly 45-and hour on a sunday brunch, especially in this location. FUN FOODIE FOSHO! :)"
3488,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait to get our food was long, but the wait was worth it.  Our food was very good.  They had very limited options that met my vegan dietary requirements, but they worked with me to modify their menu options.  I did not like how greasy the food was, but the food tasted very good."
3489,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you happen to be in the area, this is a good place to go. We decided to go for brunch on a Thursday around 9:30-10 and there was already an hour wait. Luckily there were a few things we needed to do so we were able to kill the time. There was A LOT OF FOOD, defintely share or prepare for leftovers."
3490,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Three of us went here for breakfast January 2015. It was a weekday morning. Lots of conventions in town this week and we were told we'd have a 20 minute wait which  turned out to be only 15 minutes. Sometimes restaurants that have humongous portions tend to leave a lot to be desired in the freshness and taste categories -- not here. Everything we had was supersized and super delicious. The pumpkin and pecan pancake must have been 12"" - 14"" in diameter and 1/2"" thick. Yet it was perfectly cooked through and extremely tasty. Their banana French toast was outstanding and so was the dish of eggs, potatoes (nicely cooked) and hash of artichokes, mushrooms and spinach. Coffee was great. Biscuits were as big as your fist yet still light, fluffy and very tasty. Service was excellent. Really not sure why I'm not giving it 5 stars. We will definitely go back here again for breakfast and might try it for dinner as well."
3491,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The food is good but the same can't be said about management. I was staying at the linq and I didn't know they closed every last Wednesday of the month. I approached the escalator as she was putting a sign in front of it. I asked if I could go up just to buy a drink, not food, and she rudely sapped fine. As I went up, she followed closely behind and said to go straight to the bar as the floors where wet since ""they were closing"" (she could've said this close to 5 times) I approached the bar and was greeted by a kind bartender who made me an unspiked kiwi watermelon lemonade. I paid and as I was making my way out I saw a gate had been brought down in front of the escalators. I asked the host which way I could get out and was told through double doors near the escalators, but the same manager came up out of nowhere and snapped once again with an attitude, ""you take the elevator"". I know it sounds like she was being helpful but the tone of voice can say a lot."
3492,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is one of my favorite places to eat. Everything on the menu is absolutely amazing and you get huge portions! My favorite is the tractor driver (gigantic pancake with eggs)...yum:) Their drink menu is also a must see. 
This location has a much bigger kitchen which means less of a wait time than the one on Sahara! Come check it out..you won't be disappointed."
3493,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I ate here a couple months ago and liked it enough to come back to write their review
The service: Great personality to the waiter who was as friendly as they come and food came piping hot - not waiting on a counter somewhere.
This place has an excellent pancake - made giant just the way I like it.
Portions for everything else as everyone here mentions are huge and somehow thats exciting for me =)
Their rosemary chicken on waffles has great and has good flavor - chicken could have been in the brine just a bit longer to lock in more juices but still overall a good piece of fried chicken.
Came back with some friends for a second time too - we all had a great time."
3494,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is the BEST! Only down side is they told us 30-45 minutes for a table and you all have to present to be sat (three of our friends were just down the steps) or they give your table away. ANYWAY, the food was amazing, five of us got the sage egg Benedict. It was the best one ever and it is huge (you can split it with 3/4 people unless you are super hungry). The service is good but the food takes 40 mins or so to get to the table (it's cooked fresh) definitely can not wait to come back"
3495,Hash House A Go Go,3,"What the frick. Could the dishes BE any bigger?!??!

FASHOOO share with someone when you eat here. Do not even doubt the size because anything you get will be good enough for 2 if not 3 people!! You definitely get your moneys worth, but the food is definitely not ideal to take to go when you can't finish your meal so try to find a dish wanted w your friend and just gooo for it.

Somehow I finished all the toppings of my HH original benedict only leaving behind half the mashed potatoes and a little bit of the biscuit (WHICH IS TO DIE FOR BTW THE BISCUIT WAS OOOOH LAWDDDD)

but everything else....

CHICKEN POT PIE - the size of an actual freakin pie. looks like a pie that threw up its insides gracefully

SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT - huge pile of compost lookin food but BET IT TASTED GOOD

CHICKEN ROSEMARY HASH PLATE - big square plated hash on a pan big enough to cook on

just why. never again not listening to reviews. satisfying, but really hash house?? really???"
3496,Hash House A Go Go,5,The fried chicken with waffles was really good! My boyfriend and I agreed that the chicken was very moist and not overlooked. My Angus beef and Swiss burger was equally delicious. The priced was fair and less than I expected. It was a pleasant surprise to know you are getting great food at a decent price in Vegas.
3497,Hash House A Go Go,4,"YUM. That about sums up my experience. Flew into Vegas in an early flight come 9 am we were pretty hungry! Yelp led us here and we were not disappointed! It was early so we were able to walk right in! No wait!  Bf got the spicy chicken sandwich (he doesn't care for breakfast) brother got ""the basic"" and I got the tractor driver combo! All
Were delish!!! My pancake was larger than my head! And was so good!! I just got basic buttermilk it was pancake perfection! We will definitely come back. I knocked off one star because I ordered scrambled eggs with my meal and they were scrambled to death...I like my eggs hard scrambled anyway but this was over and beyond a hard scramble...brother had over easy eggs and they looked cooked to perfection so maybe I'll go over easy next time. But I'm more than happy with this place! I will definitely say it was pretty packed when we were leaving so if you're going and don't want to wait 9-915 was perfect!

P.s a mimosa with pineapple juice instead of orange juice is now my new favorite!!"
3498,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Sweet mother of little baby bacon Jesus, I will add to the chorus in emphasizing the ENORMITY of these portions. I had to have the famous sage fried chicken and bacon waffles, and they were great. The presentation is hilariously over-the-top, and it's rare to find food that makes me laugh. In the end I do have to give more kudos to their joie d'vivre than the overall taste, which was solid but not as memorable as it looks like it should be. I don't think it's really in the ballpark to compare to Roscoe's because the approaches are entirely different, but I am more partial to their chicken's crispness than Hash's country batter-y crunch. That said, I'd absolutely return to *split* a chicken and waffles in the future."
3499,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Even though the quad (formerly imperial palace) is unimpressive and their rooms are quite gross, they do have this one diamond in the rough. It is actually inside the casino and up an escalator so don't bother looking for it from the strip. You'll just get lost. 

I came here with about 20 people (yea. 20.) and knew about the long waits but we were all willing to eat here. The hostess quoted us a 45 minute wait but surprisingly we were seated in ~25 mins despite the large amount of people in the lobby. I felt bad for the waitress though as she had to yell across the three connected tables to all twenty of us to explain the menu. She sounded like she was losing her voice but she had a very cheerful attitude nonetheless. 

Portions are ginormous so just share; I recommend it. I split the sage fried chicken Benedict with my gf and it was way more than enough. We also split the snickers pancake with another couple with us. The Benedict was very tasty and stacked high, about 7 inches in height, 12 inches if you include the rosemary sprigs sticking out of it. It could've been that we were starving and getting over our hangovers but it was an amazing combination eggs potatoes fried chicken gravy spinach and bacon. I'm glad we shared the pancake because it was huge as well, probably at 12-13 inches in diameter with chunks of snickers everywhere. Also very sweet so I only ate about 3-4 bites of it and had to stop.

Very affordable assuming you split the dish with another person. Fyi the bathroom is downstairs in the casino area.  Definitely worth stopping to try it out unless you've been to the original one in sd."
3500,Hash House A Go Go,3,I have been to the San Diego location and was excited for the rest of my party to experience it. We waited 45 mins which wasn't bad but before we even got the food we waited a total of 2 hours. I'm sorry but that should be something told to people about the additional wait time for food. We even all knew exactly what we wanted when we sat down. It made the fun experience annoying and boring and way to long. I didn't even care about the good once we got it. I will not be returning to this location.
3501,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is best for breakfast... Savory or sweet they have plenty of options for everyone. The servings are HUGE so plan for left overs or share a plate. I got the fried green tomatoes today and they were delicious!
3502,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yay hash house! I heard great things about this place for years and this was the first time I was willing to wait for it. My group of 3 came around lunch time and was notified that the wait for our table would be around 25 minutes. Due to not having all of our people there at the same time, we had to postpone our wait time but the hostess was very patient. We were able to just go up to her when all of us were there and we would get a table as soon as possible.

Once seated, we looked over the menu and decided we would share our food. We ended up getting the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and the Corned Beef hash. We shared 2 dishes with 3 people, it could have easily served 4. Sage fried chicken was pretty good. We asked for the syrup on the side because I had a previous experience with another Hash House where it was overwhelmingly sweet. Without it, the waffles were good. They were soft and had bacon cooked in them. The chicken itself was tender and the skin was crunchy. As for taste, it was excellent. The corned beef hash was not as flavorful as I hoped it would be. The corned beef did not really have a prominent taste and I kind of wish the strips were a little bit smaller in size. The potatoes were the only saving grace for the dish - i love me some potatoes.

Service was excellent. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. I dock 1 star because of the long wait time for our food. It took about 40 minutes for our fried chicken to come out and even longer for the hash to come. I guess we were lucky though. The table next to us waited over an hour for 2 burgers.

Come here for an experience like no other! Will try the sage fried chicken benedict the next time around."
3503,Hash House A Go Go,5,This was the best service I have ever gotten. Gary treated us so well and gave us space when we needed it. I usually only sit at bar tops because it's quicker and my option better service. I'm so glad I didn't sit at the bar top today! Thank you Gary for starting my morning off right! Best breakfast and service!
3504,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We decided to have a late breakfast here since it was across the street from our hotel.  I had already been to the one in San Diego, so I knew to expect huge portions.  My friends wanted to check it out to see what all the hype was about.

I went with the corned beef hash, some people got the Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion & Swiss farm scramble, and one person decided to tackle the ginormous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  

My dish was pretty good.  It had just the right amount of corned beef, potatoes and scrambled eggs.  I've had the Sage Fried Chicken before, and that was way too much food for one person.  You will pretty much lapse into a food coma right after you eat it.  That is definitely a dish two people can share.

The restaurant was pretty busy, and it took forever for us to order and get our food.  I felt like we spent more time waiting than eating.  If it wasn't for the slow service, I would've given it 4 stars."
3505,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here on a Sunday around 11:30am with my bf and they told us the wait will be approximately 45 min.  Fine, since we were just gonna drive home to SD from there anyway.  We got seated at around the 40 min mark.  Our waitress was nice, but very forgetful (in terms of food and what we wanted to drink.)  By the time the food came, we were famished.  No need to say, didn't get around to taking pictures of the food.

The food was superb and they give u ALOT. You def can split one meal in two. Worth a try, delicious, but be forewarned that you will be ""sick"" to your stomach after. =]"
3506,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My friend had the sage fried chicken, mashed potatoes and bacon....all delicious!!!  I had the brown sugar banana pancake, best pancake I have ever eaten!!! Huge portions, great service and right inside the Quad..if u valet it's literally at the top of the escalator inside the entrance.  Great tangerine mimosas too. This one much better than the one in Imperial Palace.  Will definitely be back on our next trip!"
3507,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Quite worried about the large portions after reading the reviews, but the sun-dried tomato with goat cheese scrambled egg omelette came in a manageable quantity, and was definitely enough to kick-start a day in Vegas. 
Fluffy scrambled egg was what you'd expect from any good quality American breakfast, and the hazelnut mocha overflowing with goodness was a nice complement. 
Though the line to get in was long and it was a busy morning, once in the servers were prompt, polite and attentive. Definitely worth a visit if you stay on the strip."
3508,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Went to the one in Vegas at like 4 AM and had really high expectations for this place. I prefer breakfast food over lunch food so I was really excited to try it especially with it being featured on the Food Network. My friend and I split the corned beef hash and it came out and wasn't what I imagined corned beef hash to be! There were chunks of meat instead of slices of meat and it didn't look appetizing at all. It also didn't taste good! The portion is huge so maybe that's why a lot of people really like it. 

Would never go back here again."
3509,Hash House A Go Go,1,"what a horrible experience! we come here EVERY time were in vegas...but this time we found CARDBOARD in our food. not only that, the shift manager AND general manager were so extremely rude about the whole situation...needless to say, we will NOT return. i am a restaurant manager and that was no way to treat your customers. in such a big grossing restaurant you still need to take care of your customers. what a huge disappointment. i wish i could give zero stars."
3510,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We were walking around the strip Thursday at 3 AM in the morning. We were very disappointed to make it to this restaurant, despite the sign saying that it's open 24/7, only to find it closed."
3511,Hash House A Go Go,4,Finally got to go to Hash House after missing it the last few trips to Vegas and I was not disappointed. My wife and I shared the famous Chicken and Waffles. I would recommend anyone without a hearty appetite or the ability to take leftovers home try and share something on this menu. The portions are huge. Just watch the Las Vegas episode of Man vs Food if you want to see what these plates look like. I can't speak for anything else on the menu but the Chicken and Waffles are awesome. Just expect a wait no matter what location you visit.
3512,Hash House A Go Go,5,Come hungry or share a plate!  The portions are huge!  It's hard to wow me for breakfast because what are you really going to do to spice up bacon and eggs?  This place did it.  I had the Chicken Benedict and it was punch yourself in the face good.  It was so good I could even tell you what my girlfriend had haha!
3513,Hash House A Go Go,5,They weren't lying when they said their portions are pretty big it is recommended to share plates. I got the Sage fried chicken and waffles with fried leeks and let me tell you it was super good and savory! Of course I could not finish it all but I attempted to! My boyfriend got the Andys Famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which looked yummy and was full of flavor. The service here was good and fast when it came to delivering our food to our tables! Will I come here again? Most definitely!
3514,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you come here, you better be hella hungry...like don't eat for a day or two. The portions are beyond huge and you will try and clean your plate, but fail. Reasonable prices and they let you take your cocktail glass with you--and if your waiter is cool like ours, they bring you a brand new one to take home. There's always a wait, but it's worth it."
3515,Hash House A Go Go,4,Well worth the wait! Highly suggest the fried chicken benedict...the chicken was moist & the cream sauce was delicious & spicy. Only negative was the bland bloody Mary
3516,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place, food is more then you can eat and very delish! My first time eating here is in San Diego, hands down this place is AWESOME! Hash House a Go Go need to be on Man VS food/ Diner Drive In & Dives! 

U will not be Disappointed! TRUST ME :)"
3517,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This was my first chicken and waffles experience and I'm so glad I waited this long to try it! My man and I split a plate because the portions are huge and we wouldn't be able to take any leftovers. They don't have heat lamps in their kitchen so they bring the food out the moment it's finished, hot and fresh. My only complaints was that it was a hard place to find at first and the waiter wasn't attentive but all was forgiven the moment I tasted the chicken! So yummy!"
3518,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Chicken and waffles was great! Me and my boyfriend shared. The biscuits are good. The hot chocolate was huge and yummy. 

We went early around 9 am and there was no wait. After us there was a whole lobby of people waiting! Restaurant is 24/7."
3519,Hash House A Go Go,5,Huge portions of delicious food. Their service was always on point as well as their drinks. One of the best places in Vegas to get breakfast!! They offered everything on the menu 24 hours no restrictions. That's always a big plus!!! Definitely worth it!!!
3520,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Quantity over quality... Is what I think this restaurant believes in..  Or maybe I just got tired of eating the gigantic portion of the same thing over and over again.

When I found out that this restaurant was on Food Network & the Travel Channel, I knew I had to try it. The wait wasn't that bad. The whole lobby was packed with people waiting with their beepers. The restaurant is huge itself too. Children are welcome. It's located on its own floor at the LINQ.

The portions here are definitely big enough for 2-3 people to share, depending on how hungry you are. One of the plates was featured on Man VS. Food- I think it was the dish called Andy's Sage Fried Chicken or something like that. It was huge!!! My brother got. There was fried chicken, a giant biscuit, and a bunch of other stuff in between... Including gravy. It honestly looked exhausting once you actually started to dig in. I got the brown sugar banana flapjack. It consisted of one pancake fried with bananas and brown sugar. One pancake the size of half of a large pizza that is. My flapjack was delicious! The other food itself is okay, pretty ordinary. 

I'd just come here to check out the portions for this place and to take cool food pictures."
3521,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This ""twisted farm food"" cafÃ© in the heart of the Imperial Palace was my breakfast location of choice for way to many early mornings. The urban/farm type decor is different, but well kept and clean. The food here is an experience to say the least. The menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as the O'Hare of the Dog which is a 14oz Budweiser and a side of bacon! Or the BLT Bloody Mary. They are known here for their Fried Chicken and Waffles which are extreme for sure. Please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. The service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of ""punk rock"" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. I never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..But I did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. The home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right I said GIRTH!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. This went the same for their signature ""hashes"" for breakfast. The ""crispy potatoes"" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...I had the ""Smoked Salmon"" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes I could have hoped for...Although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change. The ""stuffed"" burger here are tasty, but beware the horseradish mashed potatoes. I got these for dinner one night and lugged them back to my room. There was SOOO much horseradish on the taters that I literally coughed them right back up. I know I know..Sorry for the visual, but I don't want any fellow Yelper's getting sucker punched by these taters in the future.
Perhaps I just ordered the wrong items 4 out of 7 meals, but I think if the food completely catches up with the service and hype, then this place is going to be a real Vegas draw!"
3522,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious food, HUGE portions...Had the meat loaf sandwich and had to take half home...the Gf and i should have shared a meal"
3523,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A lot of food. Been here twice now and both times walked right in, but we got there fairly early. On the way out there was a huge line to get in. Everything I have tried has been delicious. Staff is friendly and prompt."
3524,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You definitely get your moneys worth of food! Oh my lanta! The portions are HUGE I did not come close to finishing the chicken and waffles. Which were delicious. The waffles are made with bacon inside of them. The breading on the chicken tasted a bit like syrup without me putting any on. The customer service was great as well. Our server was very attentive but not annoying. 
The corn beef hash was extremely good l. The for beef was very moist and addicting."
3525,Hash House A Go Go,5,Proportions are monster and the food is delicious..service was very good..a must do spot in Vegas...
3526,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We absolutely love this place! We have been twice now. The food is really good and the atmosphere is great. Busy place. Huge portions, the chicken and waffles is so good. Vanilla waffles with bacon in them. Yum! We will go back when we visit Las Vegas again. I recommend you try this place at least once."
3527,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Mmmm amazing! 
5 girls. 3 dishes. 
Fully stuffed. Didn't even finish the food. $12 each.
First off I would recommend to split many dishes so you can try many thing.
Second be prepared to wait. 1 hour wait Satuday at noon to sit. Another 45 mins for our food."
3528,Hash House A Go Go,2,I wanted to see what all the fuss was about here. This breakfast place gets ridiculously busy! They do have huge portions and they do not have kid meals. The pancake they make is about the size of a large pizza at Pizza Hut to give you an idea how big it was.  It's like a hubcap on the car. That's how big the pancakes are. The pancake was delicious. I didn't think it was worth $14 with a scrambled egg and 2 small sausage links. They do tell u that the portions are meant to be shared Bc it's so huge. I ordered the freshly squeezed tangerine juice off of the menu per the waiters recommendations. It was $6.50 and it taste just like the juice from the grocery store. It didn't taste like fresh OJ. The freshly squeezed tangerine juice tastes like it came from the dole container from the supermarket. I was expecting something freshly squeezed here. And I've had freshly squeezed so I know it wasn't as advertised. I rather pay half the price and go to IHOP for my breakfast.
3529,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Food was great,  large portions...HOWEVER, service was awful!  We got seated at the same time as another couple, though in a different section. Our waitress obviously forgot about us after bringing our drinks and taking our food order because we didn't get our food for another 45 min. let's just say the other couple was paying when our food arrived.  food was good,  but definitely not worth waiting over 2 hours to be seated and eat."
3530,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was the first restaurant we went to when we went to Vegas. The food is very good, I got the sage chicken, and it was great! The portions are HUGE, and by that I mean you could probably get one plate and share it with one or two other people. I honestly don't think that you could go wrong by going here, but the drinks were a little pricey being around $8 (for the 'fancy' coffee, at least). However, you could totally go here and bring home leftovers that would feed you for days!!"
3531,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I hate eggs benedict, but tried their Sage Fried Chicken benedict anyway. Verdict: it was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. If you normally eat a smaller portion, split this meal! We couldn't finish this plate between two people. And who wants to eat leftovers in Vegas?  

The sangria was outstanding as well. Definitely stop here and wait. It's well worth your time. 

If you can't split your meal, the homeless people love your leftovers :)"
3532,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food portions are huge and can be shared between 2 people. We ordered a house hash with meatloaf, red peppers and spinach. It was crazy delicious!  The meatloaf had a unique, fresh taste. We also ordered the basic which was split between 2 people. The flapjack barely fits on the plate. We highly recommend and always stop here when we're in Vegas."
3533,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food was ok and I was not pleased with the 1.5 hour wait to get our food. The apple juice that I order was spoiled with a horrible taste. My overall experience was ok, not sure if I'll come back."
3534,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We ate at this restaurant as a group for breakfast twice. The portion size is huge so plan on sharing. We had a salmon brie scramble the first morning with a waffle. The second day we shared the sage fried chicken Benedict. Both meals were excellent. My husband enjoyed the Smores Mocha and the Carmel All Over Latte. Service was great and prices are very reasonable, especially for this area."
3535,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food is off the hook. The presentation is awkward but everything tasted excellent. Some of the dishes I think they need to make patrons aware that it's enough food for two people. Seems like a popular tourist spot so expect a wait for a table. We went on a Monday morning around 11 & it was busy.
3536,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash Haus is one of the few restaurants in Vegas where you get your money's worth of quality and quantity of food. The portions are definitely huge (although I ate basically my whole skillet...whoops)! The chicken and waffles can be shared by two people. You can definitely tell the food is fresh and home cooked. My omelette was fantastic (avocado, Swiss, bacon). The Biscuits are also delicious as they are infused with rosemary. My group was amused at all of the Indiana references because that's where we are from. If only Indy had it's own HHAGG!"
3537,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We ate here over this past weekend and it was the most delicious, savory comfort food. I had the chicken and biscuit entree and it was so flavorful and reminded me of a holiday meal with my family. My daughter had french toast and she devoured every bite with a smile. And my husband ordered a cheeseburger and he said it was amazing. We will definitely return. Awesome service as well."
3538,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Finally visited this spot with my mom and brother  around 8 PM of December 18, 2015 I know.. LATE review... 

any who...

4 stars I/o 5 due to our waitress (Adrienne)

I ordered Chicken Benedict - A+++
Mom Salad (Bacchanal buffet for brunch so she decided to go light) - B very simple
Brother had the tractor driver combo - A++ for the ginormous pancake (my Mother and I realized even if he had a skinny frame he can EAT he ate about 95% of his food couldn't finish the last 2 bites of the pancake because that would've been pushing it.. so imagine if we didn't go the buffet for brunch...)

Chicken Benedict
FLAVOR was amazing! every bite was just mmmm good!  even the presentation is an A

After we had finished our meal our server asked if I needed a box so I can box them to go, of course I needed one! I couldn't get to even half of my meal! 

why I knocked off a star?? our server was EHH? checked on us during our meal once and had to look for her when our water ran out :(   My friends mentioned about a biscuit that they give out before your actual meal arrives?? NOPE..... DID NOT get any.. and if I  may recall correctly it was not even a busy night coz there were empty tables all around us except for 2. Maybe the next time I visit and go to Vegas I actually get to try those biscuits! maybe a high expectation  you might think, but I think its a matter of the actual experience as a whole you have as well specially when you visit a well known/highly rated restaurant. 

Maybe a better experience next time I come back?!

to be continued..."
3539,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a favorite of my wife and I. As always, bring your appetites!  The flapjack is roughly 12"" diameter. The brown sugar banana flapjack is to die for."
3540,Hash House A Go Go,5,We came for brunch every day we were here. The portions are gigantic and the wait staff was very pleasant and warm. I recommend coming early (before 9) because there seems to be a long line after that. The drinks are slightly expensive but they are delicious and priced for the Strip. If you bring your receipt back you get five dollars off your next meal. Wahoo!
3541,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The service was horrible. And the chicken and waffles lacked seasoning on the chicken breast! Manager didn't even try to compensate me, due to me being unpleased. Don't waste your money! .If you want chicken and waffles go to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. You won't be disappointed."
3542,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was tasty...

Though be really aware that the portions are way to big.
We all shared our meals. 

The drinks are great as well."
3543,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came here for breakfast and I loved it ! Was seated right away and the servers were quick! Definitely suggest this place to anyone who visits Vegas ! For breakfast lunch and dinner !:) there not stingy with their food like other places . There huge meals for a great price and it's yummy!
3544,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So I'm writing a review from an experience almost two years ago, but I remember this well enough that I don't think it's too weird. 

Yes, I still believe the prices are outrageously expensive, but the food was crafted so well, and the service was very good, that I'm just gonna give them the 5 stars. I've eaten at a bunch of buffets at Vegas, and I thought that was the best food they have to offer. I know this isn't an original Vegas joint (the original's in SD, and it's majorly lackluster), but my experience here has convinced me to try different restaurants on The Strip.

My parents, sister and hubby (then boyfriend at the time) and I all went to Vegas for a quick getaway mini vacay.  We stumbled upon this place and although there was a wait, the food on the menu looked too good to pass up. 

When we were finally seated, a young guy was our server and he did a tremendous job. I can't remember his name, but he really did try hard to give us good service. He even ran around looking for pineapple juice for my dad's drink, even though that's not even on the menu as a drink option. Very weird, that my dad would order it, but the guy found it. 

So the vibe of the place, isn't like the original location in SD which is very modern farm-to-table vibe. This feels a little more rock & roll-ish with all the bright lights and decor that you can kinda tell it's at a casino. We waited a bit for the food but when it finally came, we weren't disappointed. Jacob and I split the waffle with eggs and bacon. It was pretty standard. Good syrup, the butter was buttery and the waffle was just a decent Belgian waffle. No complaints since it was huge. My sister's waffle was ginormous yet delicious. I think there was banana in it. And although it was very very good, it was so difficult to finish and we were eating it for a snack later that day and breakfast the next day too. The third dish was the one my parents split and everyone kept picking at. Although it was absolutely huge, we finished that up completely. I'd ordered this at SD but it was so much better here.


For the dish that everyone kept picking at, the hollandaise was divine. I could swim in a tub of that creamy goodness, and the egg contributed to adding creaminess to the dish. The hash browns were crispy and starchy. the chicken was crunchy and juicy. There were colorful peppers and green onion on top to add color and freshness to the dish. And it was all tied together by the yummy, filling biscuit. I had to stop myself a few times from eating everything because this was my parents' dish after all. 

I'm super inspired to try a different dish here, next time I come to Vegas, or at least try a new restaurant by the huge variety of places they have here. Until next time!"
3545,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow, okay, I understand the hype. My family and I were here for Christmas weekend, and we actually had this for Christmas breakfast. The restaurant is located inside of the LINQ. When you enter, look for signs for restaurants or Hash House A Go Go, it's located on the second floor - there are escalators and stairs that bring you upstairs.

We dropped in around 11:30 AM and the wait was 45 mins - 1 hour. We seated in 45 minutes. The wait times they give you are pretty accurate. 

For 5 people, we ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Chorizo Hash, a Red Velvet Pancake, and a S'mores Mocha. The portions are HUGE, we barely finished the 3 savory dishes, and couldn't finish the pancake.

S'mores Mocha - The toasted marshmallow on top is amazing!!! I basically just ate all of that and didn't want the mocha anymore, but still drank it. If you're like me and eat all the marshmallow first, the mocha itself will taste pretty bland.

Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles - Delicious! The chicken was fried perfectly, super crisp on the outside and still juicy on the inside. I was very impressed. The waffles were good and had pieces of bacon pressed into them! 

Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - Also delicious!! Once again, chicken was PERFECT. Really liked the chipotle sauce on top. The mashed potatoes were thick and flavorful, really no complaints. The biscuit was soft, a little much for me, will probably ask for it on the side next time.

Chorizo Hash - Not as good as the other two chicken dishes, but still good and flavorful. Didn't have much of this because didn't want to waste stomach room on it!

Red Velvet Pancake - Probably the worst dish of the 4. The pancake was super crumbly and and dry. It did have a red velvet flavor, but it just wasn't enjoyable since it was so dry.

Overall, great place to grab food! Prices were understandable (around $20 a dish) considering the portions and how everything in Vegas is more expensive. Would recommend the both chicken dishes for sure. If you asked me to choose between the two, I would probably choose the benedict. The mashed potatoes were just better than the waffles, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either!"
3546,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge potion sizes, good food, but a little tight. I'd recommend it overall! When we went it looked like the wait was going to indefinite, however, we were called up a good 30 mins earlier than we were initially told (45 mins) -- so don't let the extremely packed waiting area discourage you from going."
3547,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Mass quantities of so-so food. I had a tractor puller special with a vanilla waffle, two eggs, and two sausages. Everything was kind of meh. Nothing exceptional except for the insane portions. The amount of uneaten food here that goes into the garbage is astounding. 

The restaurant was PACKED. One hour wait for a table, but I found a spot at the bar. I don't know if it was because I was a single, but the service was super slow. People were being served one both sides of me faster. Annoying. There are better places to eat at."
3548,Hash House A Go Go,4,"No trip to Vegas is complete without a trip to Hash House for breakfast! There is always a long wait, so come early. The portions are huge and the griddled mashed potatoes are amazing. We have ordered multiple items off the menu and haven't been disappointed. Andy's sage fried chicken is a must! They have unique flavors and if you are a breakfast fan you must give this place a try! We have never come for dinner, but hopefully we get a chance to try it out on one of our next trips to Vegas."
3549,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I have been to the hash house on Sahara blvd. many times and had nothing but good things to say.  Not so much about this one!  After a 45 minute wait to get our food, mine was filled with oil.  It was nasty. I asked for cheese, which, for some reason they won't do, even at the other one. After I soaked up a ton of the oil with a couple of napkins, I tried to season it with Tabasco, catsup, and salt. Still couldn't eat it. The server was a nice guy, even though he forgot our milks and billed us for an extra coffee. He did take that chicken hash disaster off the bill. I will not be back to that one!!!"
3550,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hands down our favorite breakfast place to visit while in Vegas! There menu has an amazing variety, so you're bound to find something you love. I'd highly recommend getting the pot pie, not only is it delicious but it's also massive. It can easily fill two people. You usually have to wait a while to be seated but the wait is well worth it. Overall, friendly staff and amazing service."
3551,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was here after Drai's bouncer suggested a bribe in order to get in. I declined and headed to Denny's which found out it's been closed for a year or more. Bummer.
As we proceeded to look for another 24 hr restaurant around 3 a.m. one of the workers in Harrah's recommended Hash House A Go Go and we did. When we arrived we waited for about 20 mins for a table for two. Our waiter which I regret not remembering his name was prompt and friendly. I totally forgot what I ordered but it was an omelet with potatoes and a fresh biscuits decorated with a rosemary stem. I also got this watermelon drink that came with a complimentary glass cup. The drinknwas great, sadly the service felt slow. It took a good while to receive our food that I felt my stomach pretty much ate itself. I would give this place another try when I'm around the area again."
3552,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'd like to start out by stating I was fairly hung over the day we went to Hash House A Go Go. After a long hard night for my liver, I had to suffer the traditional morning hangover which ended up stretching into the afternoon (at which time we finally began our quest for food to rid this ailment). And even though the hangover symptoms had started to abate by noon, they were still present and included head ache, nausea, and disdain for flashy lights and loud noises. That being said, we  walked in the blaring heat on the strip, navigate through a loud casino, and wait almost an hour to be seated and place an order.

I only complain about the situation I was in so that you can realize how good the food must have been to get me to stop my bitching and give this place 4 stars. The corned beef sandwich was garnished with rosemary, and the bread was buttered and toasted to perfection. The cheese to meat ratio was spot on as it enhanced the flavor without overpowering it. And the meat. So succulent and savory, my taste-buds went into overdrive trying to keep up. The portions were well aligned with the price as this is no Dennys or Ihop. The price may be around doubled, but so are the portions and the flavor is increased 3 fold. I could not even fathom finishing, even on an empty stomach with no hangover. This hearty meal was just what I needed and allowed me to recover my strength mentally, physically, and emotionally.

All in all this was a great way to help with a hangover. The only flaws I saw which stopped me from giving the 5 was the long wait and rigorous route needed to find the place in the middle of the casino. I'll recommend this place for a decently, delightful devouring during daddy's drinking day recovery."
3553,Hash House A Go Go,3,"LV hangover food aka carb overload aka super stomach soaker: Hash House a Go-Go! 

Here's what's on the menu today:
Chorizo Hash with jalapenos, red onion, cheddar cheese, fresh tomato tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs and served with fresh fruit and biscuit.  After a long night of drinking nothing satiates quite like eggs and toast.  Or Hash House's version with greasy sausage goodness and some runny yolk.  Perfect for sopping up with the biscuit!

The Kokomo Sandwich: Griddled HH famous meatloaf with roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella on old fashioned mild bread.  As you can see, this baby ain't for the faint of heart.  I half hoped that this sandwich wouldn't be soggy as most meatloaves are; however you need a table saw to cut through this catastrophe.  Super dry like a loaf of tomato brick, pass!

Onto their claim-to-fame Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles: Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks.  Menu indicates that this is a ""New York Times Favorite"" and for good reason.  The savory chicken paired with sweet maple syrup is definitely the way to a hungry gal's hangover.  A crispy, light waffle with tender juicy chicken in every bite is the shit dude.  Never mind that I could only muster up the appetite for 2 bites max, this plate o' perfection was just what the doctor ordered for a second night of binge drinking.  Really, the ONLY way to do Vegas, ya dig?! ;D

*Insider's tip:  This particular Hash House a Go-Go is located inside the Quad (2 other locations at the Plaza and W Sahara road) , the newbie hotel/casino concept wedged right in between Flamingo and the Venetian.  Blink and you'll miss it kind of location.  No one really goes here to gamble, it's more of a meet-and-greet spot to sample some of the strips notable eateries, mainly Hash House.  The connecting hotel is nice and updated so definitely a good spot to book some discounted rooms especially if traveling with a large group.  The restaurant itself is dark and dinghy, very old school Vegas vibe, a startling counterpoint to the Quad's newer interior.  But ya know what?  It's quite PERFECT for the morning recovery when sleeping at the table doesn't feel so out of place, lol. *

Bon AppÃ©tit mes amis!"
3554,Hash House A Go Go,5,"3 years later, this restaurant is just as great as it always was! I'm a creature of habit and somehow always order the same thing, but it's fabulous, so why not...?!? My boyfriend and I were smart this year and got there super early in the morning - NO LINE - SCORE!!! Our waiter checked on us just enough and didn't hover over us or annoy us at all. 

All in all, a great experience, as usual. We'll be back every single time we're in Vegas!"
3555,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was good with really large portions. I got the fried chicken Benedict and my friend got the French. The Benedict was different than expected. It's mashed potatoes then a biscuit then scrambled eggs then Spinach then friend chicken topped with a sauce. It was delicious, a little spicy but good. The French toast was also very good."
3556,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome food! The wait was well worth it! We were told an hour and fifteen mins but sat us only after 30! The chicken and waffles are a must.
3557,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Made reservations a day ahead, still had 25 minute wait to be seated. Lobby packed , finally get seated. Look at all the empty tables"
3558,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food! Really big portion sizes so if you don't eat THAT much I recommend sharing. I had the tractor driver combo that came with a GIGANTIC pancake that I couldn't even finish 1/4 of and sausage and eggs. Also tasted some of the chicken & waffles. Yummmm! Not too big on breakfast foods but I would definitely go back.
3559,Hash House A Go Go,5,Thanks to yelp we found out about this place. We decided to try it and OMG it is delicious. Thank you yelp for this wonderful suggestion. We had a pomegranate mimosa and the tractor driver combo with spike kiwi watermelon lemonade. The service was great too. Alex our waiter was on it. He was attentive to our needs and offered great suggestions. He was the best waiter we have had in awhile.
3560,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Even though it was very busy and the food took forever....we enjoyed our meal.  Jay, our server, was the best.  He took good care of us and actually let us know what was going on instead of having us just sit there and wait.

My husband got the gigantic plate of chicken and waffles and ate the whole entire thing.  Crazy!  I guess it was because we hadn't eaten since 5 am and were traveling all day.  

I had the chorizo hash with eggs.  I hardly made a dent in the giant skillet.  It was very good but not as spicy as one might expect.  I also ordered a Smores latte.  Wow so good, but I seriously could feel Wilfred Brimley yelling something about diabetes.

Decent place if you are in the icky Imperial Palace and would like to eat a weeks worth of calories in one meal.  I suggest ordering one thing and splitting it between 5 people."
3561,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Man crushes. 

Guys have them. No man is immune to them. No matter how he likes to boast how hetero he is and that having man crushes aren't very manly. Odds are that he's a closet man-crusher. Man crushing does not entail an intimate coital relationship. These are just guys that you may want to go to a bar with and throw down some brews and play darts (not the of the butt variety). The focal point of said man crushes can be athletes, actors, comedians, office jerk, gynecologists.... 

To bring me closer to one of my man crushes (yes I'm not scared to say I have several....it's liberating), I decided to visit one of the places I've seen on a show I loosely base my life on. Man vs. Food (Adam Richaman). When I found out that I didn't have to drive off the Vegas strip in order to visit it's sister location, my heart skipped a beat and I'm pretty sure I behaved like a teenage girl about to come into close quarters with Justin Timberlake (wet). 

I went with the sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was void of any sage flavor. I don't even know what sage is supposed to taste like, but I'm sure this chicken was void of it. It was bland, but, I will admit, it was the best cooked fried chicken I've ever had. Crunchy batter and all moist and sh^t inside. Nothing that a little bit of salt and hot sauce didn't help. The waffles were dense. They'd give Rush Limbaugh a run for his money. And much like Rush, there was bacon inside of the waffles. There's enough food on the plate to feed everyone on the blackjack table. 

It's inside the Imperial Palace casino on the second floor. So if you're a cocksucker that likes to pretend to have more money than your Anchor Blue jeans is letting on to me and only like to be seen in Aria or Bellagio, stay out dickhead. Us regular people have more fun anyways.

Before I call it a week, here's a small sample list of men you can gush over and man crush on.  Also a list of men you need to hate.

Yes:
Chuck Norris
Steven Segal
Jason Statham
Ryan Reynalds
Jo Koy
BJ Penn

No:
Dr. Phil
Bill O'Reilly
Michael Moore

3562,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you're in Vegas do your mouth a favor and come here! I have tried lots of different things off the menu: fried green tomatoes, sage fried chicken, pork tenderloin, quesadilla all incredible and huge portions. We always share and leave stuffed! Yes you will have a wait but it's worth it!"
3563,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ordered the Cobb Salad. All ingredients were fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, in their great haste to make the serving size ENORMOUS, the chefs seem to have forgotten that the PROPORTIONS of the ingredients still matter. This was something like an entire WHEEL of Blue Cheese, sprinkled with a handful of lettuce, couple of tomatoes, etc., then buried under a bucket full of bacon bits. Seriously, it would have been AWESOME if the proportions had been even remotely reasonable. I enjoyed what I was able to eat, but what a huge waste of food!"
3564,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I came here after about 483884 hours of gambling my life savings away. So naturally I got the house Bloody Mary and it was very good. Nice and spicy. I asked for extra olives and they gave me some - overall the service was quality. 

The prices were standard for Vegas as were the portion sizes. I split the chicken and waffles with my wife and they were pretty good. The waffles had bacon in them so that's a plus. I'd recommend ordering extra syrup if you split it though. Get here early as it gets pretty packed for breakfast."
3565,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow! The meatloaf was amazing! The presentation was great and we will be coming back here again, soon!"
3566,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A Vegas must for me! They have to best Bloody Mary's on the strip as well as the uniquely large Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. AWESOME! Gotta stop by and get my late day brunch any time. Well worth the wait, especially since I can do it at the bar over a tangerine mimosa or a BLT Mary!"
3567,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Stop with the great reviews. Lets put aside the extremely slow service (it was only 6PM and the restaurant was about 40% full) and the screw up with the salads and forgetting an entree., Everyone has a bad night. So lets just focus on the food. Its just too much mediocre fare. Chicken pot pie.. just mashed potatoes with a boring gravy with more potatoes. Meatloaf - not that much flavor and again with the mashed potatoes. The salad was limp and not that cold.. not fresh.  The waffles are waffles... the chicken is fried chicken. I just don't see the amazement. So - once for the experience. But if you want a tasty meal, just turn around and go to Johnny Rockets - a simply burger will make you happier - trust me."
3568,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is a trip. When you walk in off the strip, you have to walk through a construction tunnel. There are barely any signs outside to announce that any business is still active. Once inside, the casino is so old that the slot machines may as well be from the times, when I was a teenager. The ceiling is slow. The air conditioning is set on energy-saver mode. There is an elevator that takes you up. I mean I pushed the button. I couldn't quite tell, if it was moving up or merely idling. The light for the buttons was broken. The air conditioning definitely didn't reach in there. Sweat was pouring down my front, back, everywhere. ""Las Vegas has them now,"" the line from the movie Hangover flashed in my head. There definitely was no telling, if I'd get out of this elevator.

Eventually, the door opened one floor higher. The restaurant was equally aged. The web site promised farm fresh produce. That made me think of healthy food. It's not healthy. It's super sized Southern portions. OMG, I had a tower of waffles with a pile of fried chicken on top. Someone stabbed a knife through it to keep it from toppling. It was at least a foot high. The plates were made for giants. This place is really about the portions that are so over the top and over the top again that your eyeballs fall out. It's like a freak show of food. It's definitely worth the experience of checking it out once.

I recommend splitting an entree with a party of 10. And, be sure to ask for a wolf-pack-sized doggie bag.

Hint: There are coupons floating around."
3569,Hash House A Go Go,5,"That's tooooooooo much food!!!!  Definitely shareable portions. The Ranchero was an amazing mountain of layered flavor. The kids loved the snickers pancakes. They couldn't finish them. No one finished their meals, but everyone LOVED the food!  Super helpful staff too."
3570,Hash House A Go Go,4,The sage fried chicken eggs benedict is a must have!  Everything here is supersized so bring your appetite.
3571,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came to Vegas and planned prior to try this place. First two times was a bust... Third time's a charm! Finally got to go and it was amazing!!! Portions are massive! Perfect for groups
3572,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food portions are huge! Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. Had I known I would have shared an entree. Food also had good flavor. Eggs were perfectly moist, waffles were fluffy on the inside crunchy on the outside, and the French toast was amazingly served with a sweetened plantain banana and candied pecans. Every dish I saw pass by my table had good presentation, it all looked amazing. Had 45 minute wait, so keep that in mind if you decide to dine here.  This place is also open 24/7, so perfect for those late nights out."
3573,Hash House A Go Go,5,So yummy! Rosemary fried chicken and waffles- a must! Waitstaff was great and attentive. Will definitely come again when I'm in town! :)
3574,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was warned that it would be huge portions and i warned by husband as well...but why was it that he still wanted to order an additional pancake (that was bigger then my head)...i don't know. So they are famous for their chicken and waffle dish. Bacon stuffed waffle was good, chicken was kind of bland. I've had better chicken and waffle at numerous other places, however there is enough food on the plate to feed 2, may 3, people. 

Overall the food was okay, but it's definitely a bang for your buck if you've been losing at the tables in Vegas. Oh and the one in The Quad is now open 24/7."
3575,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wait time was to be expected given the area, time of day and popularity. Service was extremely fast, waiter followed up on every request and order. Food seems pricey but enough to bring some back to the hotel. Portion size was huge but absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend the 2 Eggs and Sausage Biscuit with Mashed Potatoes."
3576,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Big portions and delicious food. If you're going to have a heart attack, this is the way to go."
3577,Hash House A Go Go,5,I have to start with the service a class. The fried chicken and waffles was everything and then some. The drinks were incredible too.
3578,Hash House A Go Go,5,"THIS PLACE IS FABULOUS!! I can't rave about it enough! 

BIG PLATES! 
DELICIOUS FOOD!
Good Drinks.

Andy's Special Benedict was lovely! By far my favorite thing that we ordered. We did have to search for the egg cause there were so many other things on the dish. But seriously - this is a Benedict on crack! You are going to want it again. 

The Hash Original was awesome as well. Jalapenos with chili and potatoes (which I normally am not a fan of) was delicious! Came with a yummy biscuit and fruit! Such a good dish and actually manageable portions relative to the other orders. 

French toast with bananas and pecans: lovely french toast! The bananas came with the peel still on...could've done without that one, but the dish was still pretty awesome!

BLT Bloody Mary was good only because it came with a mini sandwich bar: large bacon slice, lettuce in the drink, and toast with Mayo packet. Nice snack when you are starving and your meal is going to take 30 minutes to get to the table. The drink itself wasn't that great. I wish it was spicier and less watered down. 

I won't even ding the waiter for being rude and annoyed at our changing orders. We had every right to change the order once we saw how much food was being served, but he could have been cool with it. 

I love Hash House! Might be my go to spot in VEGAS - I did hear that they might open one up in LA - CAN'T WAIT!"
3579,Hash House A Go Go,2,Won't be back. LOUD LOUD LOUD!!!!!!! Came to eat an early dinner. Did not know it would be like eating in a dam bar.
3580,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I arrived at 4am looking for some good hearty food and I have to say I was impressed. Given the time, The service was quick and attentive. I ordered the chicken and waffles, chicken was amaze-balls. It was not dry at all and fried perfectly. Waffles were well made, not soggy nor doughy. Serve size was huge but that didn't stop me from continuing on with my own plate. If you're in Vegas, you have to try this place."
3581,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service was terrible. The food was ok. I ordered corn beef. Found it odd to have a biscuit with my meal. I get the ""western"" or ""country"" deal but to me it didn't go with it. Wish the orange juice was freshly squeezed too."
3582,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Came  here after a long weekend of vegas. I stuck to the normal the basic wich was two eggs, sausage, bacon, or ham, toast, potatoes.

The potatoes were really good I have to say although I did not like the onions o it. 

The rest of my party had the famous chicken and waffles. It was GIANT and they were not able to finish it all. The waffles had bacon IN IT.. it was interesting and the staff were friendly. However, the wait for horrible. There were empty tables inside and they made people wait for like 15-20 minutes!!

It was not the best breakfast place I went to though.. MEH"
3583,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is thee best place to get large portions with little price to pay. It reminds me of Claimjumpers but cheaper.
3584,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They have the BIGGEST portions, but service really depends on the shift. I've been there a few times now and sometimes service is great, and sometimes it's just ok."
3585,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Visited Hash House again and tried the Kokomo this time. I definitely think my experience this time was better than the last, but still can't quite give the place five stars. I consider 5 stars to be an establishment that is exceptional in some form or way.

The good news is that though the Kokomo (meatloaf sandwich) was good, but not great in my opinion. However, I was able to make 3 meals out of it. Tons of food! My only other suggestion is to get the cheese mash potatoes side. AMAZING! And for whatever reason leftover meatloaf tastes amazing the next day.

All and all, a good solid experience. Definitely value in the meal, especially for a place on the strip. Will definitely come back again.

Solid 4 stars out of 5."
3586,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One complaint is I was not aware I needed a copy of my reservation, especially when I received confirmation it had been accepted. So when I did not have it I was asked to look online, but needless to say there was no service. I felt as if the hostess thought I was lying. Eventually the hostess said okay as soon as your whole party is here you will be seated. The food was good: three of us got Blue Crab sandwich with fries and one got the salmon breakfast dish. She said hers was a bit too fishy for her but she finished a little over half. Our sandwiches were full of crispy lightly crusted crab & it was good as well as the fries. Decent size portions. Reasonable prices. Watched people receiving huge portions and many having to get to go boxes. We managed to finish our sandwiches but only about 1/2 to 2/3 of fries. Would like to go back to try the dinner menu sometime. Would recommend to friends and family. Would also recommend sharing some of the breakfast plates especially the chicken/waffles and pancake plates."
3587,Hash House A Go Go,5,Way off the strip and beaten path so it was pretty easy to get in.  Enormous portions. Perfect after a long night of partying.  Everything is big here including the desserts.  Food alll seemed fresh and delicious. Great Bloody Marys also.  Cheaper than a Vegas buffet and just as filling.
3588,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went here for a non traditional thanksgiving feast with my family of 5. Wait was minimal, service outstanding, food...wow. Everyone was happy. The chicken and waffles lives up to the hype and then some. My daughter was able to order a traditional thanksgiving dinner with turkey and all the trimmings. The biscuit bowl with biscuits the size of softballs with honey butter were a big hit. Did not partake in their famous Bloody Mary with the bacon garnish but have added them to my to drink list. Thank you HHaGG. Best Thanksgiving ever!"
3589,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is top notch of you are looking to fill a hungover belly. Although, be prepared to wait in line for a while. 

We got a combination of the scramble, waffles, and standard breakfast. With endless coffee!  Waitress was on point with the coffee refills and service in general."
3590,Hash House A Go Go,3,"4 visits to this location and usually have to wait to be seated. Went for dinner during the week and restaurant not very busy. Good food and great sized portions, I always leave taking half my entree back to the hotel and eating later. 
Also ordered and drank the BLT bloody mary with bacon, lettuce and tomato along with toast lol, very strong.
2 different servers delivered my drink order and entree and they just sat it down on the table, customer service could be a little better but I think their popularity is the food and not people they hire. Disappointed with the service"
3591,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place had Great service and the food was awesome! It's a must try.... You will definitely need two people or more to share... The portions are enormous. A must stop...
3592,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait was about 45min-1hr on a Sunday morning. When we finally were seated we were greeted quickly and our server was awesome. The snickers pancake was huge and yummy- great to share! In fact, everything is great to share! The portion sizes are ridiculous, almost wasteful because it's basically impossible to finish. The HH quesadilla was yummy- the rest of my party had juevos rancheros and crab eggs Benedict. We also had the Tito's Bloody Mary martini- OMG so good! The food was decent, prices were good for the strip and how much you got and the service was excellent. Definitely worth a trip. The only thing that was a little weird was that EVERY dish had a base of mashed potatoes that weren't really great and didn't make sense... like seriously- why does my quesadilla need to be served on a bed of mediocre mash? Not a big deal- just kind of weird."
3593,Hash House A Go Go,4,Large portions of made to order unique breakfast items.   The wait can be a headache and the decor is old which is the reason I gave it four stars instead of five.
3594,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love Hash House A Go Go!! Came here for a second visit during my stay at The Linq. The first time I came (around Thanksgiving time 2015) the wait was RIDICULOUS. We waited almost an hour to be seated. This time around, however, we only had to wait about 10 minutes. I ordered the Tractor Driver Combo with the french toast. Usually I tend to go for flap jacks or waffles, but decided to try something new. While the french toast was good, I definitely regretted not getting the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. If you visit Hash House, it's a MUST that you get the chicken and waffles."
3595,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food poisoning :(
Eating here on Saturday ruined my night and ruined my Sunday plans. not to mention i had to fly back on sunday... never again."
3596,Hash House A Go Go,5,Portion sizes are amazing. The pancakes are really good. The portella mushroom sandwich is good if you're looking for something healthy.
3597,Hash House A Go Go,4,Hugeeeeee serving for the price. It gets busy though so cleaning time is rushed. One good thing after leaving my phone i was still able to get it.
3598,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Ok food, VERY GREASY, had chicken strips and half the portion was fried. Barely any chicken. My stomach was NOT happy with me. I came in looking for a grilled chicken breast. Didn't find it. Don't recommend"
3599,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Big portions would be an underestimate. Service is good and portions are amazing. Go late at night for quick seating. Have to try the signature drinks, always top notch."
3600,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Everything the world needs to know about us fat Americans can be found at the Hash House A Go Go.  Vegas is a city of sin and this is Gluttony at it's finest.  Hash House describes their concept as Twisted Farm Food.  It's American comfort food taken out of it's overalls and dressed up.  I came here for one thing.....The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I saw it on Man vs Food and knew someday it would have to be mine.

So many times when a place ""creates"" a tower of food all combined together on a gargantuan plate, it's not well thought out.  This is different and the key here is each ingredient is great on it's own.  From the bottom up we have mashed potatoes, nicely seasoned and thrown on a griddle to get them slightly browned.  Then why stop with one starch when you can have two?  The mashed potatoes are topped with a couple of fluffy buttermilk biscuits that are some of the most tasty I've ever had.  Followed by fresh spinach (it's great that they don't cook it so it doesn't get mushy) and slices of Red Beefsteak Tomato.  This is topped with a couple of slices of hickory smoked bacon and then it's namesake....A half pound well seasoned fried chicken breast.  Corn flakes are used as the batter and it keeps it's crunch well.  Top this with scrambled eggs and cheese.  The cheese is fried up on the griddle so it's melted prior to going on everything else.  This also creates a nice browned skin to the melted cheese.  I forgot to ask what cheese they were using, but it wasn't too strong.  It seemed it's main job was bond itself to the chipotle cream sauce that is poured on top and create one cheesy gooey chipotle sauce that seals everything in.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  I hope they never open a Hash House near me because I could see myself craving one of these life ending creations often.  5 Stars all the way.
The masterpiece... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#4MG6MmBLXIl1kwp_ucw3kg

And here's a nice cross section of it to fully appreciate all it's glory...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#50iLIS2poMhauloTh8so2w

I also got a chance to try the Big O' Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  We all agreed while impressive to look at, it wasn't on the same level as Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was a tasty deep fried pork cutlet but I found it needing more than just the sprinkling of ketchup on it as it got a little dry.  I did love the pickles as the vinegar flavor worked well with the pork.  Perhaps some kind of creamy BBQ sauce would have been better.  The bun was a whole wheat bun, but was a throw away here.  Why whole wheat?  I have no idea.  3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#sMJihbRjw3f9nOLeumyMPQ

My wife for some reason got the most boring burger on the menu.  As such I found myself saying....just a burger.  Their burgers are two half pound patties stuffed with a few different options.  Well it doesn't seem that they are really ""stuffed"" just things are put between the 2 burgers.  She got bacon, cheddar, and avocado.  So to me it was just how they layered everything, big deal the bacon, cheddar, and avocado was between two separate patties.  There was also no sauce?  Just ketchup.  We asked for some mayo, so it wasn't so dry, but this place should really come up with their own sauce.  If you want a burger, there are better more creative options in Vegas, such as Burger Bar or Bachi Burger.  3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#hjjZMDOZjlfQE0GSgrp17A

I'm sure there are other 5 star dishes here as I saw a lot of amazing looking things.  My daughter's plain pancake was one of the best I've ever tasted.  They do them all kinds of ways here.  Of course the pancake was the size of a medium pizza and a good 3/4 inch thick.  For sure I'm trying one of their hash dishes next time.  After all they are called Hash House.  The Meatloaf and Smoked Mozzarella Hash sounds great with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  I can recommend the banana latte.  It was excellent. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#V1jbFFDhdWldAaGeyBHHWg

Expect at least a 20-30 minute wait as the word is out on this place.  They told us 45, but we were in in 20.  It's a huge restaurant and they move them in and out fairly well.  Open 24 hours!!!!"
3601,Hash House A Go Go,5,"this place deserves five stars! the ones who gave any less most likely did not order the SAGE FRIED CHICKEN BENEDICT! lol 

but beware, servings are huge so plan to share!"
3602,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It was my first time here and I heard there was a hype to try this place. Myself being a brunch person, my stomach was ready for a good meal. 

As approaching there Sunday morning, the wait was about an hour and I expected it being Vegas and people usually either hung over. 

The menu is pretty straight forward. I ordered the garlic chicken hash houses. It came with egg any style you want and a large biscuit. Food turned out really good and was able to take some back for the road. Our server was consistent and checked up on our table just enough times. A plus is that they are willing to split bill for the table. 

Definitely will be back when back in Vegas !"
3603,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is just RIDICULOUS! It's the best place to go to cure a hangover, or just down on the most comfort food breakfast you'll ever have. Enjoy it with a Bloody Mary, and you are good to go!"
3604,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Five stars for the enormous portion sizes, great food, and excellent service! Came on Friday around noon with a party of 5 expecting a 1hr wait. We were seated within 10min and we ordered our food right away as it takes nearly half an hour for the food to come out (busy restaurant). I suggest looking at the menu and figuring out what you want before you sit! I think they may do some reservations but not for weekends and not for the day of. I would call and ask!

I have gone here a couple of times and one dish can certainly fill up three people. We got two dishes for five people. It was very affordable splitting two dishes amongst five.

Order the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Perfectly crispy fried chicken with small thick fluffy waffles (I wish the waffles were thinner and crispy but that's just my preference). I also recommend any of the Benedicts (Smoked Salmon is sooo good!) Also prepare yourself as the presentation of these dishes are insane and do not disappoint.

It was difficult to speak to each other or even to the waitress across our booth amongst the noise in the restaurant but we only came for food and we happily left satisfied and full with room for Fat Tuesdays."
3605,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Crazy big portions and great, friendly service. There is a big wait to get in, but we just had to try the place. I had the Man vs Food breakfast and it was very tasty. My kids all enjoyed their meals and the Service was excellent. I have to admit was was a lot of fun to see the other dishes being delivered to other tables and seeing the expression of people's faces when the food was put in front of them. LOL"
3606,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Despite all the fantastic reviews, I refuse to force myself onto the ""A Go Go"" hype.  The aesthetics of every plate is amazing, however I find it unpractical and more or less of a disturbance to eat around (or figure out of how eat).   

I wanted to try this place out for quite some time now, especially since a ton of my facebook friend's have been checking in and promising how delicious their chicken and waffles are so on my last day in Vegas I decided to make a detour to the airport and grab myself a brunch with a well needed bloody marry. 

1.  Parking.  You're forced to park inside of the Quad Resort parking lot and if you have a large vehicle I'm pretty sure security will harass you to make you not park in their three story parking lot (They did that to my brother in law).

2.  It's a maze just to get to the restaurant.  Gotta walk through a hall way, go up a fancy elevator, then go into some corridor to get to another elevator, walk through a casino, walk up a flight of stairs and then boom, you've found waldo.  

3.  No bathrooms.  Nope.  No restrooms in the restaurant.  You've gotta manage your way down the stairs, across the casino, and walk through a little mini shopping strip just to get to the restrooms.  

4.  When I stopped by their filter in the water was down.  No complementary water, so you're forced to shell out the $3 for a bottle of water. And if you do decide to order that bottle of water, think nothing much of it 'cause it's more like an 8 oz. bottle.  No refills, just blow another $3.

5.  Ordered the chicken and waffles.  For some odd reason there was an over exaggerated amount of rosemary and onion spread throughout my plate.  The syrup was less than half filled in the small condiment cup and when I asked for another one (since I was sharing with my boyfriend), it took them 5 minutes to bring us another small cup of syrup.  By then, the chicken and waffle was cold.  Oh, weren't we supposed to have eating utensils too?  That took another 10 minutes to get that and an additional plate to eat with.  

6.  I found their bloody marry's to be quite delicious, however I didn't need the collectors cup (which I didn't know was at an additional fee...heck, I didn't even know that there was a regular plane jane bloody marry) so I ordered another one.  Took a long amount of time to get that second and when I asked the server to rinse out my ""collectors"" cup, he forgot to come back and get it rinsed for me so I had to ask again.

Maybe I just had an off the wall bad experience, maybe not?  But I'm pretty sure the next time I crave for chicken and waffles, I'll just buy a box of Krusteez and a small box of Popeyes chicken."
3607,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food, service and GINORMOUS food portions.  I guarantee that 90% of the menu items are big enough to split.  I have been here a couple of times and learned my lesson only once.  I got the chicken and waffles.  I love the fried onion and the amount of bacon in the waffles!  I also get a bloody with all the fixins.  This is a meal on its own!  I've seen other items and have gawked at the size of the plates.  It's very American, and a Vegas fav.  Be prepared for a long wait and to have your entire party there or you won't be seated."
3608,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We were recommended Hash House by several friends who will remain anonymous.  We were told about how good everything is, and that it would be worth the wait.  Plus, we were there late Saturday morning, where people would be lined up for some serious eating to remedy their hangovers--I expected a wait, so the 30 minutes it took to get us a table didn't bother me.  

The service once we were seated, was spotty at best.  We were warned by our server that the wait for the food can be a little long, and we appreciated that--but after 20 minutes, coffee cups and water glasses were empty, and no one came by to check on us.  Food came out all at different times--the 3 others at my table all received their plates within a few minutes of each other, but my plate didn't show up for another 10 minutes--my husband had already finished his portion of his meal by the time I was able to start on mine.  Once our food had all arrived, our server completely disappeared; he never stopped by until we had been finished eating for at least 20 minutes, waiting for boxes and our check.  

Another issue I have with Hash House is their no substitutions policy.  I realize it adds some extra work for the kitchen, but if you are on any kind of special diet (especially for health issues), just be forewarned that they will not make any special substitutions.  My husband and I both have issues with gluten and the thought of eating a biscuit bigger than my fist just plain hurts--we had asked if we could substitute the biscuit for some fruit, and we couldn't--it was really a huge waste.  

However, the food we had was pretty good, and the BLT Mary I had was TASTY, so it's why I added the second star.  Still, I would be hard-pressed to give them my money again next time we're in Vegas."
3609,Hash House A Go Go,4,It was pretty damn good. I had the sage chicken and egg Benedict (MvF) and it was delicious! The portion size was huge! We waited for a table for about 35 minutes but once we were seated our orders were taken quickly and the food arrived fast. I suggest ordering one of their bloody Mary's while you wait because they are quite tasty and help with hangovers... Especially the one I had. Haha.
3610,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went here and were almost scared away by the line but it moves really, really quickly.

I got the chicken and waffles and they were pretty good but it's a boneless chicken breast which is never the best choice to fry because it comes out dry, which this one was. The sage was detectable and the bacon waffles were very good.

My buddy ordered the banana brown sugar pancake and it was GREAT! I would have probably liked my meal better if I hadn't tried his. Although they're known for their chicken and waffle meal the banana pancake is huge (think pizza sized) and decadently delicious.

A great value and a very filling and tasty meal."
3611,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Biggest pancakes ever! You need 2 hungry people to finish 1 pancake. Open 24 hours. Great service even late night at 2am. Good food, good experience. Already recommended Hash house to friends and family and they've tried it too and loved it. Keep up the great work. Viva Las Vegas."
3612,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Come hungry or be prepared to take back bags full of leftovers. Their plates are gigantic! The chicken and waffles is an eye popper for sure. When this baby is being taken to a table, all eyes are staring because it's nothing quite like you have ever seen. Their pancakes are also a bit on the larger scale. Great staff, the food comes out really quick, and you can't go wrong with their prices for these unbelievable sized dishes. Great selection of juices as well. 5 stars for this place! Keep it up!"
3613,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Some people come to Vegas to gamble, others come to try their luck at the chance of finding love. For me, I come to Vegas to unleash the beast that's in my appetite.

After flying a red-eye to the Sin City, Hash House A Go Go was the first place for me and my buddy to grab our bite at 3 AM. I love that the place was still pretty occupied, and yet, there wasn't a line for us to wait in. Upon seeing the menu, I was torn between getting the Fried Chicken Benedict with Sage, Steak and Eggs, or Fried Chicken and Waffles. My buddy and I eventually settled on splitting the benedict dish since it seems like a perfect dish that has a bit of all that's lovely for a hearty breakfast. And when the food arrived, our jaws dropped at the sight of the mountainous pile of glorious food. Yelpers weren't kidding when they said the portions are huge. I attest! I attest! Yes, indeed, they ARE huge! I loved the crispiness of the fried chicken, and the hollandaise sauce had just the right amount of savoriness to each bite. The mashed potato was also pretty good. What didn't turn out so good, however, were the biscuits. I found them rather dry and it was hard to cut into the portion that didn't have any gravy soaked in. It was as if they were cardboards or something. Aside from the food, service was great and the place is perfect for anyone at anytime. Gotta love joints like this that are open 24/7!"
3614,Hash House A Go Go,5,Delicious. .. but huge portions.  Share them.  I had waffles with bacon. So good.  Friends had scramble with potatos....excellent!  The other had sage chicken man v food. It was huge!  Had a little kick to it. .. but really good.  Get there early. ... there was a huge line to get in.
3615,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is a must when in Vegas.  Portions are off the charts.  Taste incredible. Staff hip and current creating a fun energetic experience.  Great Bloody Mary's and other assorted drinks.
3616,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Damn. The flapjack is HUMONGOUS. Bigger than my face.

The wait was long (as expected), but my girlfriends and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal as well as the frosty watermelon drink."
3617,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The portions are huge, but unfortunately the food is mediocre. Ordered the Big O Sage Fried Chicken & Waffle Tower, Bacon Avocado Onion & Swiss Scramble, and Caesar Salad to split with friends.

The Chicken & Waffles--I have definitely tasted better from a lot of places. It was very bland and the batter crust on the chicken wasn't very crisp.

Bacon Avocado Onion & Swiss Scramble--Just a regular scramble you could likely make at home. Nothing special.

Caesar Salad--Way overdressed. We ordered the salad for some quasi-healthy ruffage, but it was just a soggy salty mess.

Overall, okay for a meal if you're looking for huge portions for not that much money (although I wouldn't call this place cheap either) but if you're looking for food beyond the quality of any old low budget chain restaurant, look somewhere else."
3618,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food and great atmosphere! Long wait but if you put your name on the list and go gamble for 20 your table should be ready. The plates are HUGE so if you're wondering if you can split a meal the answer is YES (you will still have left overs lol).
3619,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Big portion, but takes forever to get to you. I had the ckn hash, and the ckn was good with the potato. I usually don't do the carb, but I did because it looked and smelled good. They were nice enough to give egg whites, no subs tho.

Fruits could of been better instead of a slice of cantelop and a slice of something else. I think the bacon waffle could of been more crispy instead of so plain and white looking. 

The cost was seriously buttered up, so if you like buttered toast, choose that then!

I do like the tea (orange spice and also ordered lemongrass). 

I had to wait forever for the server to come over, at first they said they sat us at a table no server, then turns out that a party of 12 was there so our server was occupied. 

The price is ok for the portion and amount of food. Enough for you to take food home with you. There's also no heat lamps so food is brought out as they are made, so you might have to eat your food first than your guest."
3620,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Don't be fooled. This restaurant is all about the huge  portion sizes and the way they present the food to you. On this late evening visit I ordered simple  bacon and eggs and the bacon at Denny's tasted 10Xs better plus to no surprise to me the bacon was ice cold. The breakfast potatoes were so dried out from either being overcooked or not fresh I could not eat them, even my toast was dry. The Bloody Mary was so thick and tasteless I couldn't drink it, it didn't even resemble anything like what a Bloody Mary should taste like!  I have been to several different locations and really never had a great meal except once I had the meatloaf which was good (at the Sahara location a while back) but that was it!  I have also gotten ice cold food and the most horrific lemon chicken at their Reno location!  Four strikes and they are off my list... I will never return to any of their restaurants again."
3621,Hash House A Go Go,3,"So much hype. I have bookmarked this place since my first trip to Vegas when I was 21, and all I have to say is FREAKING FINALLY after how many years? Goodness! 

NOW OPEN 24 hours?! Wait, what?

First off: PACKED. 30-45 mins wait. Note that if you are a larger party, you will be waiting longer (5+ people = large). How they do their seating is: smaller parties first and then large parties. And you all have to be presented to be seated. If you check in with the host saying how many groups before you, she/he will not tell you that it's one SMALL/LARGE group before you - FYI.

Service: Our waitress was sassy at first. Maybe because it was a busy Saturday and everyone got on her nerves, but it was definitely not early... We went around 11 close to noon and it was crazy packed. Later on she was attentive to our needs and became nice. We tipped her anyway!

Food: LARGE PORTIONS. I cannot stress that enough. So if you're a hungry hippo, you'd be satisfied with your own plate, for sure. But a girlfriend and I split a dish. (I don't know what they're popular for, I just heard great things about this place). I ordered the Egg Benedict Smoked Salmon = HUGE. Nicely decorated and visually appealing; so good enough to eat for sure with a side of crispy potatoes. 

I wish it didn't have the biscuit, it made the dish extremely heavy. The dish included: cheese, eggs (duh!), dried tomatoes, spinach, salmon (not a lot at all), biscuit and mashed potatoes (starting from the top to the bottom layers). So definitely a heavy plate with the potatoes and biscuit. The flavor was in the middle, like some bites were very bland and others were good.

I was actually not satisfied with my order. And it was on my end, not the restaurants. I should have went with the salmon scrambled dish - had a bite out of that and OMG so baaamb! 

Venue: It's in confusing area - The Quad, and parking was a hassle or whatnot. The restaurant is actually really big, and I couldn't tell because the way it's laid out. 

Definitely would come back and try another dish - maybe dinner time since it was so packed for brunch!"
3622,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I don't know what the hype is about. This had to be the worst breakfast I've ever had. My friend didn't even eat her pancakes. It was so dry and dense. I had the french toast and it wasn't that good. The breakfast potato were the only thing that was actually good. The waitress asked me if I wanted whip cream on my french toast so I said ""sure"" and when I got the bill she charged me 99 cents for it. It would've been nice to have stated that especially when she was the one that offered it in the first place and oh don't get the biscuits."
3623,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have always heard that this place was a MUST every time you are down on the Strip. 

One thing I just have to say: B I G portions!!! Even after sharing a meal, I was still full and felt I was about to burst open. My boyfriend and I shared the #2 burger with a side of french fries. It was GINORMOUS, bigger than a baby's head! But it was delicious---my favorite part about it is the queso cheese just dolloped into it (if you're a cheese fan, this is the burger for you!)

I am disappointed about one thing though, and that is why I gave this place a 4/5: I wanted my HH Bloody Mary to be really SPICY. The waiter advised me that it already came super spicy and I took his word for it, but when I got it, it tasted like a glass of Worcestershire with a dash of tomato juice a thimble of vodka. I had to ask the waiter for a bottle of Tabasco, just so I can make my Bloody Mary the way I wanted it in the first place. Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ 

Besides that Bloody Mary ordeal, our server was still great. He apologizes that I was unhappy with my drink, which I of course accepted and he was still so polite and had a great attitude throughout the time of serving us. 

This place is definitely the place to go to when you're a hammered, starving drunk after your time on the Strip!"
3624,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've dined here twice when I visited Vegas and thought it was pretty good! Honestly, I can't quiet remember what I ordered both times (yikes, Vegas does that to me sometimes!) but I vaguely remember the first time I came here I split with the BF and whatever we ordered had fried tomatoes. It was yummy!

The second time, I believe I ordered one of the benedicts and I smashed it! The gravy was good! Sorry that's pretty much all I remember :(

What I do remember like it was yesterday is the bloody mary! Great flavors! I love a chunky, heavy bloody mary with lots of yummy pickles and toppings. This one hit the spot for sure! :)"
3625,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We always visit this restaurant when we come to Vegas!  We have eaten at three different restaurants in this chain and always receive good service and great food!  Love the Chicken and Waffles!!  Their Bloody Mary is amazing, a meal in itself.  We always split meals because the portions are huge!  My husband loves the Corned Beef Hash also!!"
3626,Hash House A Go Go,5,Place is amazing!! We went here around 9pm after drinking all day. My husband got some kind of scramble that had avocado and cheese ugh was so amazing! Get the French toast also you won't be disappointed!! So so good!!
3627,Hash House A Go Go,4,"FINALLY somewhere in Vegas where I can get a bang for my buck. The prices are decent and the portions are huge. When we arrived, we were told the wait was going to be about 45 minutes but only waited 20 which was good news for my tummy. Our waiter looked overwhelmed but he was quick and did a great job at trying to keep up with all of his tables. For $60 we got the following:

Coffee - decent
Some coffee pistachio drink - amazing
A pineapple mimosa - strong and delicious 
Soda - not flat so two thumbs up there
Corned beef hash skillet which came with a large biscuit and fruit- tiring after awhile
Crispy Cornmeal Salmon Sandwich - this was plated beautifully with sriracha/mayo sauce  drizzled around the sandwich
A platter of chicken and waffles - ginormous, salty and sweet goodness in every bite

My only complaint was that the chicken and waffles didn't come with nearly enough syrup. I needs my syrup! I was not only stuffed beyond my skinny jeans but buzzed because my mimosa was super strong so hash house a go go was worth every shiny penny for me!"
3628,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Pretty Good! wasn't ""wowed"" by the overall taste probably because of all the hype, but this place is legit! huge portions, fresh food! great place... a must in Vegas!"
3629,Hash House A Go Go,1,"food was meh
server was awful
line was long

meh meh meh"
3630,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was the best!!  Came here for lunch on Saturday.  Wait was about 45 minutes.  But it was so worth it.  The waiter warned us that the portions are huge and that we can share the entree.  We should have listened to him.  Each of us ordered our own entree.  I ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.  the meat looked like it could have been for 3 sandwiches.  My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and my other friend ordered a scramble.  Omg!!  They were so good.  Prices are reasonable.  My entree was about $15.  Great price for the portion.    Will for sure come back!
3631,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ordered the sage fried chicken Benedict which is one of their two recommended ""famous"" items. Pros: serving size was huge (two people could easily split or one really hungry person), the creamy chipotle sauce was pretty tasty, and the menu itself has a ton of items for every taste. Cons: the chicken was pretty dry, everything was on top of a massive pile of mashed potatoes (but it was bland), and the homemade biscuit was also a bit dry and bland. I don't think I would actually recommend overall; the dish sounded good and looks amazing, but taste was overall just okay."
3632,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Way overrated? Yes the portions are huge, but this is the U.S., it's like that everywhere. Not worth the long wait and stuffy atmosphere. I don't get what all the fuss is about."
3633,Hash House A Go Go,3,"BISCUITS!! 

HUGE BUTTERY BISCUITS IN SWEET BUTTERY SAUCE.  free as the ""appetizer bread"" of the meal.  ate one and was 80% full.

Sage Chicken Benedict
- a HUGE (head sized), unorthodox benedict.  a THICK layer of mashed potatoes, with heavy biscuits, topped with a HUGE deepfried chicken breast, tomatoes and spinach, and a fried egg-cheese mixture, all covered in yummy mayonasy sauce.  everything was good except that the chicken breast was bland and dry, and thats supposed to be the star of the show, unfortunately.  no sage taste at all

Wonderful service - very helpful and nice.  when my friends requested souvenier cups she gladly checked the stock, and got the last few cups for us.  she also very thoughtful and asked if we wanted separate checks, before closing the checks.

this place is a-ok, i would just be prepared to bring some home.  you can definitely make 3 meals out of 1 order."
3634,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow just wow! Amazing food, great service and the portions are ridiculous! 4 to go boxes later and I know what I am having for breakfast! Yummy"
3635,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House is wonderful. My boyfriend and I found Vegas on average to quite pricey as far as food was concerned. However, Hash House does not follow this trend. Their food is affordable and the portions generous. The best part is the service. Our waiter, Brad, was incredible. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."
3636,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is the bomb.  Awesome food and huge quantities ... You fat people will especially love it.  The line to get in the place can be long but certainly worth the wait.
3637,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place for breakfast! We waited about 20 minutes for a table. We were there early due to the jet lag, we weren't able to sleep. We were there around 8:30/9. The wait seemed very long when we were leaving, but they seem to try and move fast. 

I had ordered the hot chocolate because it looked good in the picture. And it really was, came with three or four marshmallows melted into it. 

We had ordered the Tractor Drive Combo, HOLY MOLY. The size of the pancake was out of control, it was the size of the plate and even hanging off the sides of the plate. I had gotten the snickers pancake, which was pretty good. I just wish they would've told me about the size of the pancake, would've shared it.  It was huge and I did take a picture..on my Snapchat..which it is gone now (sorry). 

Def recommend this place!"
3638,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I never understood all the hype about Hash House A Go Go.  I have some friends that completely adore it.  I had only been to the one in the Plaza and thought it was OK.  

My 9 year old son and I had tickets to Recycled Percussion, which brought us into The Quad.  He thought this was the place he wanted to eat.  He got the kids cheese quesadilla and I got  a salad.  He also got a vanilla Italian soda and I got the half and half lemonade/tea.  

The service was fast.  The waiter was attentive.  He also brought us biscuits, which my son enjoyed.  A waitress came by, said she had an extra order for fries and offered to my son.  He thought the food was good and the soda was an awesome new experience.  I thought the half and half was of high quality and the salad was better than I suspected.

I was impressed with the fast waiter.  Overall, surprisingly positive experience."
3639,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Anytime I am in Vegas I visit Hash House. The food is phenomenal.  Large portions for both the food and drinks. Everything is fresh,  made to order. This is a must whenever you are in town."
3640,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Been sitting at the bar for twenty minutes (post ordering food) seems like a the coworkers are showing love to each other all day. Also, she just filled drinks and took an order for someone that just sat next to us. VERY SAD considering we have been here for over 20 min POST ordering. I usually like this place, but getting ignored by our waitress while it being half an hour and our waitress telling her runner she messed up is over the top. Get your game on you head people. THIS IS VEGAS NOT A MOM AND POP SHOP"
3641,Hash House A Go Go,3,We heard wonderful things about this place!  The best part of our meal was the waiter!!!!  Very knowledgeable. EXCELLENT customer service.  We both had the chicken and biscuits.  I had mine with the white sausage gravy!!!  The best white gravy I have tasted out side of New Orleans!!   The food was lukewarm and the chicken tasted like it was waiting under heat lamps for awhile.  I enjoyed my green beans and the biscuits were great with the sausage!!!
3642,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Mmm yummm!! My friend and I stopped by here for lunch on our last day in Vegas and boy am I glad we did! There was a little of a wait to get seated but the wait probably only took about 15 minutes or so. So we originally wanted to order 2 entrees to share and good thing we didn't because after asking our server, he said we should definitely share. So we decided to get the fried sage chicken benedict that everyone is highly raving about in the reviews. And apparently, this plate was showcased in Man VS Food! We also ordered a mint mocha latte to share. When our dish arrived, we just kind of stared at it in astonishment and relief that we did not order 2 plates! That fried sage chicken benedicts was massive in width and height. Loll. The fried chicken was fried perfectly and tasted really good especially with the mashed potatoes, eggs, tomatoes, bacon, and the thick sauce that the dish came with. Such yummy goodness! Even after splitting this dish, both my friend and I couldn't finish it. It was just so much food!! The mint mocha latte was really good also; just a perfect amount of mintiness! :) I need to bring my BF here next time!"
3643,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When I told my girlfriends that our best bet for breakfast was in Imperial Palace, they looked at me like I had sprouted a second head. I saw their doubts and thought, ""Ohhhhhhh, you just wait...."" I think they now know to never doubt the girl who constantly is checking Yelp for recommendations. 
I started my meal off with their HH Bloody Mary. Ooooooh, so good.... nice and spicy with a green bean and pickle garnish. Hells yes, pickle. BOMB. My friend opted for the BLT Mary, which came complete with a strip of bacon, a romaine leaf and a small piece of white toast. For reals? Yep.
I had heard about the Sage Fried Chicken with Waffles (which my friend got and OMGOMGOMG... yeahhh), but knew myself better than to even attempt and instead got the roasted chicken scramble. I seriously love any type of omelet/scramble with chicken, and this was no exception for me. I chose the crispy potatoes... glad I did. The potatoes themselves weren't crispy, but they came with super-crispy bits of the potato skin that had come off in the cooking process. Nom nom nom. Those three words are actually the perfect description for this place.... so I will leave you Yelpers with..... Hash House A Go-Go (yes, even in Imperial Palace)=nom nom nom."
3644,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Very convenient if you're staying at the Linq. The service isn't consistent. Some trips have been good and others, not so good. 

You can get the most bang for your buck here. Portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. There's not a plate splitting fee so, you can definitely share a dish. It's that much food!"
3645,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Long wait but it's worth it. Humongous portions. Flavorful good. When you share, the price tag is super reasonable, especially considering this is Vegas! We'll come back! 

Cons: how the hell do we get there?!!"
3646,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House is your typical American diner with BIG taste and BIG portion! The second time around I got to tried way more items on the menu and learned to share everything! Like before the banana pancake is super fluffy with a caramelized crust that's irresistibly addictive! The chicken waffle is also really good especially if you like herby sage batter and crispy waffles...oh wait, they're BACON filled crispy waffle! If you're really hungry, go for the chicken pot pie. That thing is not big, it's HUGE! It's also filled with very heavy thick cream that's really filling. I just wish it has more veggies and that the veggies are cut into smaller pieces and softer. The scramble is just okay. It's probably the smallest portion out of items I just listed...however super cheesy and flavorful.  

The service is a little lacking as it's such a busy place; however the waitresses tried to remember as much as they can and were very nice about everything."
3647,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We got to the Quad for check-in around 2 am on a Monday night and were absolutely starving. Headed to this famous place at the suggestion of a friend. It was clean, comfortable and mellow at 2:30 am. There were a few people around us, so it was fun to hear the gasps when their giant plates arrived'
Our server, Tyler, was the kind of person you return for - especially because of his knowledge, demeanor and care. I thought he was a manager, but he just takes his job seriously and respected everyone he was serving in a way not typically found on the strip. 
He had recommendations for us based on our questions... The corned beef hash was TO DIE FOR. We returned the following night for some dessert, and instead ended up ordering his rec of banana and brown sugar flapjacks. Dear God, he was right. I plan on eating here at least one more time before we leave! The menu looks limited, but anything you order will leave you in awe! Must eat here!"
3648,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was excellent! So much variety so many cool different plates to try! Don't be afraid to mix it up & try something new! I got the rosemary chicken asparagus hash & oh my fuck it was dank
3649,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I try to come to one location every time I visit Vegas and this visit didn't disappoint. Our server, Billy, was great at keeping us updated even though they were swamped and we saw management helping to clear tables which is a sign of good work ethic and great managers. My kids lived the food and even my boyfriend who says he doesn't care about food said it was the best Vegas breakfast, of you can afford the prices."
3650,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Followed the reviews and came here for breakfast. The portions are HUGE! Bring your appetite. My wife and I shared a French toast plate with eggs and bacon, and we could not finish it. Great flavors and everything was cooked perfectly. The cold brew coffee was excellent as well, of course I added a Bailey's shot to it. 

The staff felt cold, they seemed to be understaffed and stressed out. Service was mediocre and a little slow, other tables seated after us got multiple plates of food before us. Don't let this turn you away though because we still gave a 20% tip, having worked in the food industry I understand there are off days. 

Overall would definitely go again."
3651,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Located inside the Quad or Old Imperial Palace or Future Linq. Second floor entrance off a set of elevators of its own near the center of the Casino.

Tips: Come hungry and leave full as portions are country sized. Order a drink as the water is disgusting. 

Service and wait staff was friendly and not  prompt. We arrived early and seated before the breakfast rush. Food order was taken. Drinks refills for water and coffee came upon requesting.

Tried one of the skillets. Skillet was warm, moist, flavorful seasoned, and delicious. Toast was burnt. Dishes are accented with wheat, sage, or various farm fair. Presentation is something to enjoy in it's own. 

Coffee was decent not stellar.

Overall three stars. Good food and drink presentation. Service quality was not great nor bad. Willing to come back with an appetite."
3652,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House is simply amazing!

I now make it a point to visit this establishment every year during my trek to Las Vegas 

The staff, atmosphere along with the amazing menu make this restaurant a have to dine experience"
3653,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Farm food on crack. The heart and soul of Americana is this place.

Let me start off by saying the portions are HUUUUUUUUGE!!! Huge. My friend got an lb of hamburger...which doesn't sound that big after you've ben drinking all day, but a pound is a pound is a pound and it was enormous. We ate it with a fork.

The second time we went we got the chicken and waffles. YUM. Worth the hype. Share it with someone. the chicken is juicy and the waffles have bacon crumbles in it. My heart is twinging at the memory of it, but sooooo good! Go!"
3654,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I fell in love with this place... Woke up at 11am and we were starved. We needed a solid meal to eat before leaving Vegas. So I yelped up ""brunch"" and found Hash house a Go Go! 

Took us forever to find this spot. There were so many people waiting in line. We waited close to an hour to get to in. We were sooooo hungry. 

Service: nice and polite, they were very helpful as we were first timers. 
Ambience: very trendy and ""barn-like"" decor. The booths were so spacy and comfortable. 
Food: Amazing, aaamazing. Let's first talk about the portions. SOLID portion! I was sooo full from lunch, then I had enough for dinner as well. The Andy's Sage Fried You must, must try the Chicken with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuits (15.95). The chicken was good, maybe a little dry. The scrambled eggs were sooo fluffy. One of the best eggs i've had. The bacon mashed potatoes is just delicious and solid. The bacon did just the trick. The biscuits were sooo yummy. My friends get some butter and the peach jam to put on the biscuits. SOOO GREAT! Such a good price and great portion! My friend's food portions were very generous too.

A great brunch place. I will definitely take my boyfriend here next time since he is a picky brunch fan. Will recommend this to others as well."
3655,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food was decent, the service left a lot to be desired. After a MUCH longer wait to be seated than we were originally told, we order our food. It wasn't until then that we were told the kitchen is running behind and it would be 45 minutes for our food. When we finally got our food, the portions were HUGE (definitely recommend sharing) and were decent. My scrambled eggs were very dry but the corned beef hash and biscuit were very good. Not sure if I would dine here again."
3656,Hash House A Go Go,1,"First off, when we arrived at our table the last persons tab was still there. We had heard that portions were large, but they were even bigger than what we were anticipating. As a chicken pot pie lover I was super excited to order this. My bf ordered their popular chicken and waffles.

The pot pie tasted terribly plain and almost watered down. As if this was made using a huge pot and sat there all day until served. The crust was not flavorful either, certainly not the usual flakey buttery crust pot pie usually is accompanied with. There was also way too much going on in the pot pie (corn, bell peppers, greens). Idk if this was distracting or the lack of flavor in the dish overall. I ended up only taking a few bites before losing my appetite.

My bf's chicken came out lukewarm. But apparently it was fried...? Didn't seem hot enough to be ""fresh"". The waiter also forgot his shot... acknowledged that he forgot but didn't apologize... or try to compensate. another person ended up taking our plate away after realizing we were done. Aka our waiter didn't. 

Would not recommend."
3657,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What a great experience! You have your hostess ""Echo"" that fits the atmosphere. Her spunk and welcoming attitude made the entrance to this restaurant an event. The place is huge! I felt like the walk to the table which was the back room was a mile long. It's the hunger setting in!  Gabby our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful! She was on top of her game  with her service. 

Tangerine mimosa was the recommended drink! Husband approved and had no complaint.

OMG!  I have to say that this was truly the best Chicken and waffles ever! The bacon was cooked inside the waffles. The sweet and salty taste literally made every bite a delight!!! The chicken portion was overwhelming but we polished it off!   I'm a salty eater. Needed to sprinkle but my husband said it was fine! Don't take my advice on this.  Only for salty eaters! The salmon Benedict was amazing. It had spicy kick that I promise made this entree a hit!  The salmon was embedded in biscuits, smashed potatoes and the creamy hollandaise.  Asparagus and extra spice on the side was the treat!  

If you are a breakfast eater, please don't miss this place in Vegas!!! It's so worth the money and the wait!!!"
3658,Hash House A Go Go,1,"One star is being considerate....... 
Went @ 5pm on a Saturday & sat @ the bar. Bartender was restocking the bar @ the other end & never greeted us. While we waited patiently for her to come over, 4 people walked in wanting drinks to-go & she served them before even greeting us. I had to stop the Manager to take our drink order & food order after waiting about 10 minutes. 
Only about 4 tables were occupied in the restaurant, yet it took about 40 minutes to get burgers for the 3 of us. The food was decent but customer service was horrible."
3659,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious food! Big portions! We had breakfast here and it was awesome. Like others said, the portions for a lot of foods are shareable... Especially the pancake! The pancake is the size of medium pizza! It's not only huge, but yummy. As were the crispy potatoes. Highly recommend eating here!"
3660,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is definitely the one place you should eat at in VEGAS.  The food is beyond incredible with farm fresh quality and flavors that will excite your taste buds.  We went for breakfast (get there early because there is usually a wait).  Since the food is made fresh for each meal generally the wait for it to come out after you order is about 25 mins but it is well worth it.  Their portions are huge so I would suggest sharing or plan on not eating for the remainder of the day :)
3661,Hash House A Go Go,5,Really good and huge portions. Second visit and will make this a regular shop in Vegas.
3662,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So I've gone to Hash House a few times now, when out with friends on the strip, I'm a local, and I'm quite pleased. They have great breakfast options, especially waffles. The price is reasonable, which is awesome considering they're on the strip. Good food and no complaints here. I'd go back."
3663,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place! We go to the one in San Diego and love it!!! Great food and a ton of it.
3664,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This review is for our server SCOTTY. (Bigger guy with a colored tattoo on his right forearm)
I know we got here late but that is no excuse for the service. He didn't even look at is when he mummbed for our drink orders. No smile and no introduction. He then disappears and we are left sitting somewhat awkwardly. I honestly thought he was a busser from that. When he finally came and got our order he looked around the entire restaurant except for us, the customers sitting right in front of him. 

Later someone at our table wanted to order a coffee and once again we had to sit there for a while cause he disappeared. When ordering the coffee, he WALKS AWAY mid order!! What the?!? And then asked if we wanted cream with the coffee loudly from another table he was near. That was the last straw. 

I've worked in a restaurant and no matter how exhausted you are or bad your day is, make an effort to make it look like you somewhat want to be there. And obviously make your patrons feel somewhat welcome. Is that too much to ask of you Scott? 

Bottom line, the food is amazing but if you get seated in Scott's section, ask to get moved."
3665,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This place is very hit or miss. If you come when it's not crowded, you can get good food and good service. If the place is slightly busy, or you are very early or late, they are very unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor to serve you food. I showed up late a couple times and wished they had just told me I was too late to eat. 

The food is pretty bland and nothing that you couldn't make at home. A pancake with a snickers bar laid in the middle sounds awesome, but they do nothing else special with it. 

The chicken is best but make sure you get it fresh and hot or else it's a bit soggy and sad. 

Also, they tend to be very conservative to the point of mocking people on welfare.... So if morals guide you, let them guide you away from this place..."
3666,Hash House A Go Go,5,I don't even know where to start. This restaurant is amazing. I love their food and the portions are so big! They have a wonderful Military discount and I could not be more happy with the food. Definitely recommend this to anyone who wishes to enjoy good old American cuisine.
3667,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Breakfast on our last day in Vegas. We waited all week to enjoy this experience. We've been to the location on Sahara and had a 5 experience. Not so much here. The food was terrific, as usual, but our server was horrible. We made sure to say upon sitting down that we needed coffee, lots and lots of coffee. She brought our cup of coffee and we didn't see her again until our food came out approx 15 minutes later. Empty coffee cup for 10 minutes of that!! Again, the food was amazing!!! It was the service that left a bad taste."
3668,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Hostess at this establishment needs to be drastically improved IMMEDIATELY!!!!

Check in @ 8:45a. Quoted at time of ""15-20 maybe shorter."" We are only a party of four. 

Checked with Hostess @ 9:05. She says okay. Check in again at 9:25a. She says okay.

We left at 9:45. Still hadn't been seated. 

Such a pathetic farce of customer service. Amazing how they just seem uninterested in making the $100+ we would have dropped  there.

Never again."
3669,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Big appetite portions not for the weak. Great food and fusions. Farm sizes on your plate no doubt! The ideas of how they concocted arranged their plates are amazing. A great place for big groups and kids and families. For a first date? Not unless u dont wanna impress ur date, go ahead and munch away with this! Expect to wait, but know that it is worth it. Have an alcoholic beverage while you're at it. Wait time is mostly 45-and hour on a sunday brunch, especially in this location. FUN FOODIE FOSHO!"
3670,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Come hungry, leave happy. How hungry are you? Picture your plate the size of the table...now eat the table! Hash House is not playing around. They want to feed you and ALL of your friends! 

I love breakfast foods... It's one of my favorite things to eat.  I usually love breakfast for dinner. However, when I'm in Vegas we eat whenever there is a break between clubbing, napping, and getting ready. After going to the club one night I convinced some of the girls I was with to stop and eat. I think they were drunk enough to follow me so we ended up here. I saw the chicken and waffles on yelp and I knew they had to be mine.

The table wanted the chicken and waffles too but I also wanted a pancake. Little did I know that it was going to be way TOO MUCH food! We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower for 18.00. It comes with drizzled hot maple syrup & fried leeks. I also ordered The Pancake Tractor Driver Combo for 14.29 ($1 for specialty pancakes). It came with eggs, bacon, hash browns and a buttermilk pancake. I substituted brown sugar pancakes. I also got egg whites and chicken sausage since I don't eat pork. I had to save calories where I could. I didn't realize I was going to be able to put a dent into my food.

Come big or stay home! You will NEED to share unless you can eat mass quantities of food and are a tractor. The food was so good I honestly wish I could've finished it. However my goal is not to look like a tractor so I need to eat in smaller quantities. I will be back but I plan on sharing!"
3671,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I'm not sure why people think so highly of this place.  Those who do maybe have never had good fried chicken.

The chicken and waffles was disgusting.  No flavor and dry.  Presentation was nice and that's about it."
3672,Hash House A Go Go,4,"HHAGG.. you win this one.. but only because of chicken and waffles... short story long:

Walked in and was greeted, took 20 minutes to seat us.. (for 2) and it was packed.. 

Ordered 2 bloody Marys (BLT style) and biscuits and gravy, extra Bacon,  and my chicken and waffles. The waiter who took the order asked if we wanted crispy potatoes, we said yes. Asked how we wanted the eggs, we said over easy.. comes back, and says he put in over medium.. So he fixed it to over easy.. then put came the drinks, the bloody Marys were amazing! Best bloody Mary I've had! The food came out and the potatoes were not crispy... they were mashed... we just decided to go with it.. but my chicken. and waffles, AMAZING!!! :) so amazing and so portion friendly that I had enough for dinner and breakfast the next day! :)"
3673,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My 1st time here and i loved it (except having to wait 15 mins). We went on a Sunday around 10am and there was ppl waiting around all over the place, I was like omg this is gonna be a long wait but since we walked from Aria to eat here we were gonna wait no matter what and thankfully we had to only wait 15 mins which isn't bad but when they called us to be seated they took us to the room on the left and why was there lots of empty booths? but they had everyone waiting. Well anyway i ordered the Farm Scramble with Bacon Avocado, Onions and Swiss, it was so freakin good and huge it came with crispy potatoes( super yum )and a biscuit! My bf had the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and he liked it a lot also, the portions were big ,we both didn't finish our food even tho we tried too lol. They were a bit slow and didnt really check up on us til we were done ,but I would definitely come back!"
3674,Hash House A Go Go,2,"My second visit to the IP location.  On my first visit (May, 2012), I had no idea what to expect, with the word 'Hash' in the name one is led to believe hash browns would be involved, when in fact, nothing comes with hash browns.  My friends ordered one of the large fried chicken 'breakfasts', I wasnt in the mood for a giant meal, so I ordered 'Andys Famous Bread Pudding', which comes with coffee @ $8.95, it was more than I could finish, and ok, I'd call this the 'value play' on the menu here, everything else is gonna wring your wallet.
2nd trip, we again visited the IP location on a Monday morning; driving into the IP location at this particular time (10/22/12) is INSANE with the construction going on, and their parking garage is deplorable.  The wait was crazy long, luckily the beepers they give you work immediately downstairs where we could play video poker at the bar and drink 'free' coffees.
When we got back upstairs to the waiting area, they called out our name instead of using the beepers (?).
The decor here is farmer-full-metal-jacket, with plate metal on the walls.  I think this creates sort of a Faraday cage where no cell signal attempting to transmit Yelp Checkins or Photos is possible! :) Both times here checkins/photos failed to go thru.
Waiter was fairly attentive, after we ordered he then warned us the kitchen was very slow and orders were running 30-40 mins.  Oh goody.  I ordered the 'steak hash' and a V8.  Wife got bacon/eggs and coffee.
Steak hash, with sun dried tomatoes and topped with green beans and potatoes, along with two eggs on the side, came served in a faux iron skillet (meaning, it wasnt used to cook in).  Sometimes I think chefs add sexy ingredients that are going to sound good, without really thinking thru the flavor.  It was really quite dreary tasting and unappetizing, and the steak was overcooked slices of beef.
After tip we were out $40 for breakfast that I really didnt enjoy much.  
So the two-star here is mainly due to the value, my opinion is overpriced 'just ok' food.

Oh, I did notice there appears to be wi-Fi here, but it needs a password, you might ask your server about it - I wont be back here."
3675,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is great.  I'm not usually big on American food at a restaurant since I could generally out-cook most American restaurant ""chefs"", but this place is top-notch.  I'll never understand people complaining about the wait.  There's a wait because it's WORTH IT!"
3676,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you don't like waiting forever to get your food then this is not the place for you. But if you don't mind the wait, then you're in for a good meal. FYI one plate is big enough to share with 2 people. Trust me I'm not a guy with hard rocking abs so u are reading a review from a fat guy & I'm telling you go half on a meal. Prices... Meh it's Vegas around $14.95 & $20.00 but you will get what you pay for & last thing. Don't go kinda hungry or you won't be eating what you paid for & who wanna walk around Vegas with leftovers?"
3677,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Went for their famous waffle and chicken. So disappointed!
Wen on a Friday afternoon after July 4, half of the restaurant are full.
The famous waffle and chicken came out lukewarm. The fried chicken was kind of cold already , so was the fried chicken!!!  They definitely made both way before customer order it.  
One star is for the friendly customer service. But even they waiter recommended their ""famous"" ""lukewarm "" waffle and chicken. 
Will not go back, will go to Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken at grand bazaar instead"
3678,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wait time was about 20 minutes. 15 mins shorter than what we were told so that's a plus. Seated & food came out promptly so another plus. Ordered the infamous chicken and waffles (a man vs food fav). Didn't really like it tho. I won't say that it's nasty but I just think it's a preferential taste. I didn't like the taste of the chicken which was kinda soggy & the skin was just falling off. It also had no flavor to me. The waffles tasted kind of weird too. Idk, just didn't work for me. I should've gotten something else. The presentation was great though. And they give you a BUNCH of food. You probably won't eat all your food in one siting. So that's a plus. Not saying you want like the chicken & waffles tho, I just didn't like it."
3679,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was great ,order chicken and waffles and grilled chicken burger. Great service , lots of people and long wait  even for food to get served. Price is good based on the amount of food they give you !"
3680,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I live in San Diego so I know hash house and I know it's good and it can get super busy. This hash house was dirty, TONS of trash in the waiting area under the benches. Hot as hell! Felt like the heater was on. Had a party of 7 they told us about an hour wait, 20 min later we go back to check our status and the hostess informed us we were still looking at an hour wait. Finally 50 min later we were able to be seated only to find out our party had to be split! They sat us at 2 different booths. One behind the other. Our waitress was a sweetheart and very accommodating when we complained she was happy to move us to a new table. Finally our order has been taken, drinks are flowing and we wait an hour for our food! I know you're busy and probably slammed with orders but to wait an HOUR for our food when we already waited an hour to be seated is so ridiculous. People don't mind waiting I assure you but if all you have to offer me is a dirty restaurant with expensive prices and terrible service then I don't want it. I will not ever be back. I do not stand for dirty restaurants who keep their customers waiting."
3681,Hash House A Go Go,4,Wow is all I can say about the food portion .. There was a long wait but worth the wait...got the fried chicken Benedict and it was great .. Chicken needed a little more seasoning but other then that a good dish.. Highly recommend ..
3682,Hash House A Go Go,1,We had a party of 12 that ate here and 6 of us got sick. My husband has been violently ill all day. I bought him some chicken noodle soup at CVS and just requested the restaurant heat it up since he got sick there and the manager just wanted to argue with me. Definitely won't ever eat here again nor will we ever stay at the Linq again due to their attitude and refusal to even try to help.
3683,Hash House A Go Go,4,We are visiting las vegas this week and this was the first breakfast we had since we arrived. I have to say I was pretty suprise by the deliscious food we got. I live in Canada and im not used to have fried chicken as a breakfast meal with my eggs. I could not finish the food because the portion are very big (for my standar) but I was happy that I could bring it back because I planned to give it to an homeless person. I have to say they were very happy too! All in all. The food was great. We had good service and a large variety of choice! I would recommand this place to anyone with a big appetite! Good prices too!
3684,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Happy Hour is everyday from 3pm to 6pm, which is worth it if you want cheap snacks and drinks in Vegas! This location at the Linq hotel was a bit hard to find since you have to walk through the casino and up the escalators, but the restaurant itself is very roomy and worth the walk. 

The Bucket o' Chicken is essentially 4 chicken tenders and some fries for $5. The chicken was juicy and was coated in corn flakes to make them extra crunchy (5/5 stars) 

Side Note: You must order the food and eat it at the bar if you want food from the happy hour menu. However, for drinks you can bring it back to your table!"
3685,Hash House A Go Go,5,Just had an amazing breakfast.....the server Sarah was friendly and super nice.  Always love going to any of the Hash House locations.  Thanks for always providing great food and great service.
3686,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Do you like waiting forever to get seated?

Do you like getting enormous  portions of delicious food that you'll want to save your throw up for later?

Do you like Bloody Marys made with BACON?

If so go to hash house a go go. Settled on the second level of a hidden casino on the strip. Awesome food but you'll probably want to split a plat with someone the portions are serious. Also be smart and get reservations."
3687,Hash House A Go Go,1,"UPDATE: omfg I got an allergic reaction to the salmon! I shoulda known it wouldn't be fresh.. it was more like completely cooked salmon as opposed to SMOKED. Now my finger has like 5 itchy bumps :'(
_______________________________

Got the fried chicken Benedict and smoked salmon scrambled. Portions were huge but flavors were ok. I would come jus for the experience but not again. Plus, it's ridiculously hard to find and impossible to explain how to get there. They need an actual sign, instead of a dark menu in front of a hallway."
3688,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love! Love! Love this place. Every year we come to Vegas we make sure we hit up this gem. Portions are huge and staff is really friendly.  You won't break the bank either. 

This last visit we had the Pork tenderloin. It was full of flavor. Delish!"
3689,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This is a definite miss unless you want to go for the fried chicken monstrosity. We went there based on the reviews, my friend ordered the salmon Benedict - and the monstrosity that arrived did not resemble either eggs, or salmon. It was a tower of biscuit walled off with mashed potatoes, gingerly topped with a fried egg, and covered with what I can only believe is a salmon that was brutally murdered and then hidden in that well of biscuits and potatoes. All this was covered with the top of the biscuit and had an orangey sauce that could very well be battery acid. This was a HUGE let down. Avoid."
3690,Hash House A Go Go,4,"""This is too much food"" are words you will never here me say... 
But Hash House, you broke me. The portions are huge (and delicious)!!! I went in super hungry and I still couldn't make a dent in the food. Just a warning, the food is made to order so it takes a while. But I was ok since the mimosas I ordered kept me busy. =) 
Definitely worth a try."
3691,Hash House A Go Go,5,Forget the buffet or the fat food option your hotel or local strip offers. This place is the best of home cooked breakfast we were able to find out here. Excellent down home menu. Bloody Mary's with a salt rim and spiced just right. Pancakes that are excessive in size but that you can't stop eating. Biscuits and gravy and more. Do it!
3692,Hash House A Go Go,1,My friends  love this restaurant.  My friends  have diamond  status  and so we can go to the front  of the line. However the host decides to punish us and make us wait till everyone  else is seated. It took 30 minutes  for our food to get to the table.  They not accept  our food  certificate.  Potions  are crazy large but the service  was unacceptable  and the host should  be fired
3693,Hash House A Go Go,4,"1:30am leaving Harrah's casino extremely tired yet extremely hungry. Those two together is a bad combination! Why?! because while you are sitting and waiting for your meal to come, you end up looking like a ""bobble head"" to the other diners. I mean my head was just ah ""bobbing and weaving""- couldn't keep my eyes open for sh*t. Thankfully I was with a group of gals celebrating my good friend's bachelorette weekend, so in between conversations and silence, I was getting some shut eye lol.

To sum up the food: delish! The French Toast meal (dang, can't remember the exact name but it's one of their most popular dishes) was slamming! It was way too much food. We all concurred that we probably could have shared (2 people share one french toast meal). 

As far as service, it wasn't that many people so why was service so freaking slow. I don't know, maybe less cooks or one waiter. I don't think I fully enjoyed my meal because if the long wait. By the time my meal came, I was too tired to even eat half of it.

Next time I will have to come with a full appetite and a nap under my belt!"
3694,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is my second time here and the service is always amazing! The food is good as well but I ordered biscuits and gravy and it tastes like they opened a can of cat food and mixed it with gravy then served it to me. Horrible! 

Everything else we ordered was really good, fried green tomatoes and pork tenderloin were amazing!  Just need to work on that gravy! I eat a lot of biscuits and gravy it is my favorite dish, this is the worst one I've ever had!"
3695,Hash House A Go Go,5,Definitely a must in vegas. Portions are huge ! My fiancÃ© & I shared a breakfast place of the friend chicken benedict. That chipotle sauce was delicious.
3696,Hash House A Go Go,5,Epic meals and super cheap.  Make sure to split whatever you get.  Every plate is enough for two.  Waffles are delicious.  Not so excited about the egg Benedict on mashed potatoes biscuits and gravy.
3697,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Large portions, good quality but not amazing

Pros- good value with portions they serve compared to most prices on strip. Quality bacon and sides. 

Cons- pancake was a little dry for the size. Denny's pancake taste was better. Surprised they are not know for their corn beef hash considering the name.

Good place if you're already staying at Linq"
3698,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Biggest pancake ever! And totally delicious. 

I had the blueberry pecan pancake and I could totally go for another one any day. 
For some reason, I was expecting sort of a greasy-spoon diner type place, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was a cute, clean, fresh food place. 
My only complaint is that some of the menu items were too complicated (I'm kind of picky). One of my friends had biscuits and gravy and the whole plate was smothered in gravy, even on top of his eggs. It was kind of strange.
It was a great place for breakfast and it was pretty empty on a Sunday at 7:30am :)"
3699,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Enjoyed the breakfast fare. I am a breakfast lover and could eat it morning and night, so when I touched down in Vegas for the first time at 10 pm on a Wednesday night my sister brought me here. Not the easiest place to find (which might be a good thing) and a bit of a walk through the parking lot, elevator and through a few hallways but our wait wasn't long, about five minutes. We were then seated at a booth and with that size of a table I wondered if we needed all the space (until our plates came out). I ordered the Farmer's Scramble and classic Belgian waffle which I knew I would have to pack for later because I can't eat much at one sitting. Not the best idea but it's Vegas! Our server was attentive and quick, taking our orders and bringing them out efficiently. I wish I had gotten one of the signature drinks with a souvenir glass but perhaps next time. I got the lemonade which wasn't too sweet but had a kick and enjoyed my time. The farmer's scramble with avocados was delicious, not overly cooked and the avocado and other ingredients did not overwhelm. It wasn't too salty either. As for my Belgian waffle it was PERFECTION. Perfectly crispy and not dry or sweet. The maple syrup was also not too thick or sweet, which I appreciated. I loved the presentation and my goodness, those portions could feed Africa! I ate only half of my waffle and three quarters of my scramble. I didn't even touch my biscuit. A great experience, would love to go again maybe in a bigger more boisterous group!"
3700,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After a delayed flight into Vegas, my friend and I were seriously hungry when our Vegas partner in crime picked us up from the airport. When she told me she was taking us to restaurant in the Imperial Palace, I was definitely skeptical at first, but I've gotta hand it to her, my girl knows her way around delicious comfort food. But when she prepped me for the larger-than-life serving sizes at Hash House A Go Go, I didn't imagine a spectacle even close to the portions at this joint. ""A pancake bigger than your face,"" is what she said. And damn, the girl was not lying!

Since it was the afternoon on a weekday in Vegas, the place wasn't exactly busy. There were a few patrons though, and our waiter was nice and attentive. Being the foodies my friend, Christina and I are, our  eyes immediately darted to the New York Times recommended fried sage chicken and waffles - we know we were going to be ordering this. We decided to split since the portions are so big. Our other gal pal ordered a pecan pancake and some fancy flavored lemonade thing. 

The lemonade was quite tasty, and this takes a lot for me to admit because I'm not a fan of sour or lemonade at all. Next our food arrived...it was gigantic! Our chicken and waffles were stacked high - talk about a heart attack on a plate! it was a beautiful presentation, and the food did not disappoint. The chicken was nice and crispy, and I loved that we could taste the sage in every bite - a nice gourmet touch. The waffles were fluffy and did not get soggy when we poured the syrup all over this outlandish dish. And, to top it off, the waffles had a bit of bacon inside. I could have done without this because it was already so over the top, but it didn't hurt the dish. My friends pancake was indeed WAY bigger than her head. I had a bite, and it was a good pancake!

We were hungry and we definitely left full after eating at Hash House A Go Go. I recommend splitting those chicken and waffles!"
3701,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I've been coming to this restaurant for years! I've always had great food and excellent service. This time it was terrible! I think our server was overwhelmed. He didn't give us any refills until we flagged him down. We waited forever to get our food and my boyfriend's order was wrong. He ordered the chicken fried steak and it definitely wasn't chicken fried steak. Then, it took a long time to get his correct order. I think it was a manager that came and delivered the correct meal. She said she would do something about it. They did credit the meal, but it just ruined the experience. I'm totally bummed! If you do try it... the portion sizes are huge. And, there is always a long wait for breakfast/brunch."
3702,Hash House A Go Go,5,The wait was worth it! Great breakfast and brunch menu. Lively and very friendly staff. And you save money because the meals are so large you have to take half home with you for another meal!
3703,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy cow. Portions are enormous.  Towers of chicken and waffles. Pancakes twice as big as a normal plate.  Interesting flavor combinations.  And it's delicious!!  Scrambles, hashes, pancakes....it was so hard to decide what to order. Wish we could have come back again for some specialty drinks (bloody marys, etc) and different items to try.  Plan on having a bit of a wait because this place is wildly popular, and rightly so.  Servers were fun, but service was slow.  Still one of the best places we picked to try during our trip."
3704,Hash House A Go Go,4,This was a great choice on my Vegas trip.  I was happy that the waiter told me ahead of time that the portions were easily enough for 2 people.  For $18 a plate with no extra charge to share this turned out to be a great deal.  The food was amazing too.  I had the sage chicken eggs benedict and loved every bite!  The reason I wasn't as happy with the place was because of the extremely long wait to get into breakfast and the length of time it took to get my food.  Luckily there is a bar setup to allow people to get bloody mary's while you wait.  We decided to go to Starbucks across the street and come back.  But I think this place is a better deal than the buffets and better quality food.
3705,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service was friendly. The wait for two was short. The food was ok. A decent serving size. 

I wouldn't tell someone they ""have"" to go here but it was a decent place. Prices not completely insane like so many others."
3706,Hash House A Go Go,4,A little on the expensive side but they give you huge portions and the food is delectable! Waiting to go back to Vegas JUST for the food here.
3707,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I know y'all be thinkin this place is overpriced when you first look at the menu. I did. Who charges $9 for one pancake? Ain't nobody got money for that... unless that pancake is the size of a pizza and would feed an army of hungry girls for days. Then it's all good. 

Seriously though, their portions are GINORMOUS.... like spilling-over-the-plate huge. One flapjack will be enough for a late night snack and maybe breakfast / lunch the next day. Not your ordinary wussy pancake. If you come late at night, you can eat well and save half your flapjack for the next morning when you wake up starving. 

We also got a few other things aside from the flapjacks. Being as basic as I am, I ordered ""The Basic,"" which included two eggs, a meat (I picked bacon), some potatoes, and toast. The potatoes were on point. Very well seasoned, done to perfection. Couldn't stop eating them. Everything else tasted great too. 

One pitfall is that this establishment on the second floor, and there's no restroom in the restaurant. If you have to go, you gotta make a trip downstairs to find the restroom in the casino. That's a royal pain, especially if you're there after a night out in heels and your feet are already dying. The last thing anyone in that situation wants to do is climb stairs and FIND a bathroom. 

I'd definitely return, though. I really appreciate that this place is 24 hours, which means you can come when you need to. The employees are nice, even toward rowdy people coming in at ungodly hours. Great place for a bite when you're starving early in the morning or late at night or any time in between."
3708,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Wanted to try it out, so I ordered the HH original Benedict. ....it came out pretty fast and was massive. I found the sauce, egg and mashed potatoes good, but the biscuit in between all that food was hard with no flavor; i had to take the biscuits out and place them to the side of my huge plate. I would have preferred an English muffin. The price was also too high for such a meal....the atmosphere is great and it was nice to see  the waiters and waitresses enjoying each other and the customers."
3709,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here because a friend said it was fun and good. Eh. Getting to it is a pain, unless you're walking the strip or something. Have to pay for parking with no validation. Once we got there, it was packed, 35 min wait with no readily available seating.

Drinks and food are expensive and not good. All 6 in our party said they woulda rather had Denny's. $127 before tip- that's for 6 (one kid) with no alcohol. More than half of the food wasn't eaten. It was ok, lots of it, nothing special at all. 

We were hoping for more. We wouldn't go back & wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3710,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions and great food. Great breakfast menu served all day. Got the chicken and waffles and they were delightful.
3711,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My favorite Las Vegas restaurant.
Sit at the bar to eat and your service will be superb.
Sassy is our favorite employee.

The dining rooms are a maze that covers quite some area.
They go from days that are slow to suddenly blindsided & slammed with customers so we can forgive the helps gets spread thin.

If you're a Veggie I suggest the wild grilled cheese and the cheezy mashed potatoes.

Everything on the menu is excellent.
You should be served honey biscuits with every meal, but some waiters are remiss in this caveat,, so you may have to ask."
3712,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm going to give this place a 10000 out of the 2000 daily calories I should be consuming daily. 

You would think that with the massive amount of food given, emphasis on massive, that the quality would be lackluster. That's not the case here, the food was actually way better than 90% of the breakfast places that I have been to in recent memory. 

The food is great, the portions are in no need of an introductory. Just go when you are hungry or if you find yourself drunkenly wandering the strip and need to prevent a miserable morning. Just don't order more than one entree unless you are attempting a world record. 

The service was just okay but you will be so busy eating you probably won't have much to ask for other than refills. I also did not have any signal in the restaurant with AT&T so be mindful of that if you are waiting on texts or phone calls."
3713,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great breakfast spot in Vegas. My husband loves this place. Super huge portions. I'd say 1 plate is for 2-3 people. We had the French toast & pancakes both are delicious.  My little guy went with the fruit loops he was in heaven.
3714,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Service was fine even though it was really packed. My wife got the crab cake Benedict and it was delicious. I however, ordered the smoked salmon scramble and was really disappointed. Lots of great ingredients but the eggs were waaaay over cooked. They were burnt and tasted awful. They did take the scramble off the ticket though, so at least there's that."
3715,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're hungry, then you've definitely come to the right place. Portions are gigantic. Be prepared to take home leftovers for another meal (or two!). 

The sage fried chicken was really delicious and their biscuit was tasty. Their flapjack is basically a giant pancake. Tangerine juice is worth a try but its basically orange juice for an extra dollar."
3716,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One word, DELICIOUS! 

This place is amazing and it's located upstairs in the Quad. The Quad is a new casino/hotel, previously the Imperial Palace. They're still renovating the place, but the restaurant is established.

I was a little worried there would be a wait, but I guess we went early enough that we avoided any wait at all. Yay! We were seated right away. Our server was wonderful. He was enthusiastic about the food and making sure we had a good dining experience. 

The Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle was overwhelming and so good. Personally I never had chicken and waffles before. The combo just sounded weird to me, but damn this was good. Hash House a Go Go has taken my chicken and waffles virginity. Now I don't think anything else can compare. You must get this when you're here! 

We also order a duck dish which was good too. All the food they offer is creative and flavorful. I did notice something though. Does the own have some kind of obsession with rosemary? There's a sprig of rosemary on every dish. LOL~"
3717,Hash House A Go Go,3,I've been here many times and always enjoyed everything. Last night it was just so-so. The service was great out waiter was very friendly and checked on us frequently.
3718,Hash House A Go Go,4,Everything I have read about this place has been accurate. This popular restaurant boosts a farm fresh feel with creativity and excellent service. My wife and I had the smoked salmon hash and every bite indeed tasted fresh and made to order. You had to wait a bit longer but the wait is worth it. The serving sizes are very generous and you won't leave hungry or disappointed. Come early it fills up quick!
3719,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food, service can be slow when they're busy but it's so delicious! Portobello burger with pesto is to die for"
3720,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I visited this restaurant twice while in Vegas. I ordered the banana brown sugar pancake both times and it was very good. The service, not so much. It is almost funny because both times, our food was taken away before we were finished eating. I don't think I have ever experienced this and to have it happen twice with two different waiters makes me assume that they are trying to move people through quickly. The first time, the fries we ordered were taken away because they were in a separate container and we didn't realize he grabbed them. The second time it was more than half of my husbands pancake. The waiter grabbed it and stacked another plate on top of it before he could even say anything. We thought about saying something but our waiter was not very friendly so we just paid our bill and left and decided we would find a different place for breakfast going forward."
3721,Hash House A Go Go,4,I sat at the bar to avoid the wait.  I really liked the food here and the portion size was unreal (pic doesn't do it justice)  Wait staff was decent too. And no...I didn't eat it all even tho I tried to ;-)
3722,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Disappointed in this location of Hash House... they never should have gone into this terrible building. It's improved since it became the Quad but still a dump. The food was about the same quality as I've had at the other locations and the service was pretty good considering how busy they were. However, the food took 40+ minutes to come out. Our poor server kept trying to stall for the kitchen and I can see it in his face that he was frustrated and didn't want to point fingers at the kitchen. But it was obvious many tables were not happy with the long waits. At least provide bread or something to the tables if your food is going to take that damn long (come to think of it maybe we should have asked for some).

Ordered the Chicken and Waffles... but didn't get to enjoy it because I got kind of full just waiting on the food to arrive. Flavors were good but I felt like it was better at the Sahara location. Friends enjoyed there food so that's always good when you bring first timers.

Biggest issue with this location is the complete lack of cell phone service. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CHECK-IN???!!! lol But seriously, the Quad and Hash House need to figure out a solution to this issue. Offer ""Free Wi-Fi"" or something! As someone who relies on his phone for work I have to say it's a bit stressful to sit through lunch at a place where I don't have access to anything on my phone.

No bathroom in the restaurant... have to go down to casino floor. Blah! Hash House you can do better! Get yourself out of that crap hotel. It's bringing down your brand."
3723,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place! So much variety and very big portions! Any entree is huge so you can share. We got the Crab Benedict which was good but too spicy for me. Also the Fried Chicken Benedict that was a little dry but good. Great service and we were lucky to get in right away. My daughter ordered pancakes from the kids menu and it was huge. I will return!
3724,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Disorganized, mediocre service - the proteins are large, and mostly good, but I don't think I'll bother with this place again."
3725,Hash House A Go Go,5,Big plates with delicious fresh to order. I recommend splitting any plate. Soooo much food!
3726,Hash House A Go Go,5,If you are really hungry this is the place to go.  The serving sizes are fit for 3 kings!!!!  On top of that the food is delicious!
3727,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It's a lot of good food but for someone very hungry presentations not that good. Amount good but quality semi good.
A long wait in line for table"
3728,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place.... Great food and service. Make sure to bring your appetite. Everything is delicious.
3729,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wait was 35 at 11am sunday and another 20 minutes for food.  Server was friendly and let us know the wait when we sat down.  But..  the food was really really good. If you like hearty breakfast foods, its a must go.  Portions are huge and prices are reasonable.  Tried their andys sage chicken benedict $20 and its big enough for 2 people. It was soooo good! We also tried their mushroom artichoke, etc hash $15 which was also good but a lot of potatoes with the benedict that was also mashed potato heavy. Had a lot of leftovers. No regrets. If you don't mind the wait.. which is common in vegas.. id say go for sure."
3730,Hash House A Go Go,3,We came here because of all the hype we have heard and the food does look good. Maybe it was because of all the hype our expectations were very high... BUT the food was just ok. Average. not bad at all but not great. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad and my hunny got the chicken and waffles. A bit pricey if you ask me for just okay food. The service was slow and there wasn't  that many ppl in the restaurant when we went. I wouldn't go back again.
3731,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came for brunch on Friday, so of course I was expecting a wait: one hour to one hour and a half, for two people. Sure we'll wait! They hand us a ticket and wrote our name on the list. We walk downstairs, gamble a bit and walk the area where the Linq High Roller is located. About 45 mins in, we head back upstairs to check and they had already called our name, so they were nice enough to seat us anyway. Our server brought water for us, then came back a few minutes later to take our order. The service was fast. It took about 10-15 to get our meal. The food was really good! I had a scrambler that came with eggs, bacon, avocado, cheese and onions! The mashed potato and the biscuit were to die for! I wish our server came back to check on us, since we were out of water. But he did return when we were full and brought us boxes and was nice enough to give us water cups to go."
3732,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always great food here. Best bargain on the strip. Most entrees can be shared. Usually grab bkft here, but decided to grab lunch instead - no regrets. 

Bkft drinks are impressive. My wife was in a sugar and chocolate coma after drinking her Smores coffee drink. I enjoyed the iced pistachio coffee drink. 

For a beverage, we had their Champagne Mojito. Good sized drink and very light and crisp. Best drink value on the strip: For the $14.99 price tag (avg drink prices now are $18-20 most places) you get an awesome drink, above avg size, plus a cool looking large, solid HH Tallboy drinking glass.

For entrees, we had the Chicken Pot Pie and the No. 5 Burger with Bacon and avocado. I'm a burger guy, but it looked and sounded better than it tasted. It was very juicy and massive, but it just didn't have a ""pop"" to it to bring the mild flavors together. The sweet potato fries were outstanding. The Chicken Pot Pie freaking rocked though. Plus, it didn't have any peas...

Wait was only 20mins for an early Monday lunch. They do take RSVPs only during the week and only if made more than 24 hrs in advance."
3733,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Such an odd location for a restaurant like Hash House A Go Go, but thankfully there were huge signs when you enter the Imperial Palace Casino to direct you to this spot. I heard about this place from my parents, who had wanted to visit the original Hash House in SD, but had to back out because of the ridiculous wait. There was also a bit of a wait at this location (~30 minutes for 3 people on a Wednesday afternoon), but when we were seated we noticed there were a lot of open tables; I suppose they didn't have enough waitstaff. Our server was amazing; really fast and friendly, calling us ""sweetie"" and checking back on us frequently. 

I decided to go for the famous fried chicken and waffle plate, and my sister and bro-in-law went for the same but in an eggs benedict version. I also had the spritzer, which was refreshing and not overly sweet. There's a very strong chance that I may be biased to give my chicken and waffles a good rating due to its behemoth size -- it was awe-inspiring -- but it actually tasted good, too. The chicken was actually tender and moist with a strong hint of rosemary (that, and the stick a whole sprig of rosemary into the chicken). The skin was ridiculously crunchy and peppery. The waffles had bacon embedded into it...I mean, c'mon, how could you go wrong with carbs, butter, and bacon? I guess it is so wrong, it's right."
3734,Hash House A Go Go,2,"My friends & I have been to the San Diego location & have been raving about Hash House A Go Go ever since.

Unfortunately, the Las Vegas (Quad) location sucked. It was pretty boring. Staff seemed rather blah. You would think that being in Vegas the staff would be more lively. 

When we got there we sat for almost a good 20 minutes before anyone approached our table. The only saving grace was that our waiter who was an older gentleman was super nice. Other than that..this place is boring & even the food isn't the same. What a shame! San Diego location is MUCH BETTER."
3735,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Landed in Vegas in the morning but I was on Atlanta time still... So I thought the best thing to do was eat brunch. This place gave me everything I wanted. A little pissed off that they don't have bottomless Mamosa's... But I may do . There was a very very long wait and Constant confusion when certain parties were seated before others.
Certain servers or bartenders make drinks better than others- there needs to be some consistency in that. We did mention to the manager that there was one bartender in particular that did a better job and he should probably train the other individual."
3736,Hash House A Go Go,2,Definitely not farm to table. Hash House serves HUGE plates of decent diner food. Don't expect layers of flavor or an exceptional breakfast experience. It simply does the job of filling your belly with lots of fried meat and carbs. It's so busy that the service isn't great either.
3737,Hash House A Go Go,3,"OMGeeeee!!!  I hope you're hungry!!

Their portions are HUGE.  I thoroughly enjoy their Mango Coconut pancakes but I can never finish them.  This place is definitely a spot where you get the 'bang for your buck'

Their Corned Beef Hash is good, their Chicken Hash is a bit on the dry side, French Toast is delish... so many selections... you'll definitely feed your craving here!"
3738,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Someone in our group decided upon this place and I went with it without checking Yelp reviews first - my fault entirely. Will never make that mistake again! Lunch rush during EDC week meant there are crazy lines everywhere. Surprisingly, our group of seven were seated almost instantly. I couldn't decide between the fried chicken eggs benedict or the chicken and waffles, so after asking our server, I decided to go with the eggs benedict.
 
This dish was unlike anything I've ever seen - the best way I could describe it would be ""multilayered heart attack"". I don't blame them though - I made the decision for myself to order the dish, but it was massive. Just the bed of mashed potatoes looked intimidating to me. Calling this dish an eggs benedict is also misguiding to its ginormous nature. I ate about 15% of my portion before I gave up and took the rest to-go. I think my friends shared similar thoughts. There was also a mix-up with an order in our group that I didn't think the restaurant even attempted to reconcile, which was a shame. But hey - what do you expect?"
3739,Hash House A Go Go,4,"As we sit down on the table is a 8x10 paper telling you to ask your server how to get 2 FREE meals... and so I asked. So this is where our dining experience goes south... was told they are out of the cards and they will not and can not honor this. I ask to speak to management  before we even placed our order. I asked a few times and was told mgr was too busy and I could write down info if I wanted. I then asked again for the manager. When she came to the table the whole tone of our experience changed. Treasure saved this review. She brought the card to fill out and I did. After apologizing the whole dining experience went a lot better. As for our sever water was kept full and order was correct. Lack of care or give a damn was just down the drain! For no reason should I have to ask repeatedly for management. Other than that, food was HUGE AND TASTED WONDERFUL. This went from a bad review to how it always should of been. Good no great food!"
3740,Hash House A Go Go,3,"During my recent stay on Vegas I stayed at the LINQ so the Hash House was real convenient. I think I went back about 3 times because of the location. The food portions are huge and seem wasteful. I had the pancakes one morning and it was just too big, and to be honest it was not good. I forced myself to get some of it, now my husband ordered the hash browns and that was awesome. That was the only reason we returned."
3741,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came here after an all nighter -- the usual people do when they are here in Vegas.  After drinking, partying and gambling we were hungry, and realized it was already bright and early.  We decided to check out the place and wait for it to open.  We got there as soon as it open, so we were seated right away.  Our waitress greeted us with a warm greeting.  She was very pleasant and answered out question.

I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles Maple Bacon Tower - its came with 6 or eight pieces of waffles and 2 pieces of Boneless Chicken Breast.  My friend ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, and the other ordered the Smoked Salmon Scrambled.

Imagine our eyes when they brought our order.  They were NOT kidding when they say that the portion size were HUGE!  I suggest that you come here very hungry or possibly just share a plate.  As far as the taste goes, Im not too impressed.  Im not a big fan of BIG portions, I prefer to have taste, quality over quantity.  I think its over rated.  The Fried Chicken Breast was dry, a little bland.  The waffles was too thick and doughy.  The Maple Bacon, well its missing the Maple flavor.  As far as my friends order, well I didnt like it so much - the Sage Chicken Eggs Benedict looks like a heart attack waiting to happen.  I did like the Smoke salmon and Eggs scramble.

I might try again - to see definitely for Lunch or Dinner."
3742,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Gamble and gamble some more. Get a total rewards upgrade, VIP, something so you won't have to wait in line. This is the third time I've been here, all great visits. Either I'm getting skinnier or I'm just not that into food anymore but I was full from the food. Oh well, the food was great, service was great. Everything was great. Is this even a review? All the food is the same but damn it was good."
3743,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is great. Cool vibes, comfortable seats, nice waitresses, and ultimately some delicious foods. Just go up the escalator at the Linq to get to this gem. The yelp reviews drew me in and their high rating is well deserved. I got the fried chicken and it was bomb. Just go here, its open always so why not?"
3744,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Unfortunately I could not eat any of the food here because they use canola oil and I am very allergic to it. My question is why use this cheap Canadian oil that comes from the rape seed, and does not benefit the flavor of the foods or the health of the clientele? Why not just raise the prices?"
3745,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is a Las Vegas staple! I always come here for brunch when I'm in town. The food and portions are out of this world. One meal here will fill you for an entire day and the price makes it all worth it. Much better deal and food than any buffet in town can offer.
3746,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Serving sizes are massive, so you could probably share the entrees. I ordered Andy's sage fried chicken, which is one of their most popular brunch items, recommended by the server, and has a nice big yellow star next to it on the menu. The $17.99 is fair for the food you're getting, which can easily feed two people.

My boyfriend ordered a scramble, and that too was very tasty. We both had the griddled mashed potatoes with our meals, which is so dang good but will fill you up quickly!

We came right before 9 a.m. on a Tuesday morning and were promptly seated. Service was pretty good, and for a moment, I forgot I was in Vegas because of the diner vibe I got. Ended up paying $36 (before taxes) for my chicken, boyfriend's scrabble, and one coffee. Everything on the strip is a little pricey, but I liked the quality of this place. Definitely check it out if you don't want to go to a breakfast buffet. It's located inside the LINQ."
3747,Hash House A Go Go,5,Such amazing food. Meatloaf! OMG the meatloaf is amazing... Be prepared for a little bit more time to prepare the food. They typically warn you of that up front because this is legit from scratch stuff here. Don't miss an opportunity to eat here when in Vegas. Oh and the portions....huge! Don't eat before coming here and you'll likely take some with you when you leave.
3748,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Crappy, tasteless food. I regret coming here with friends after drinking and the employees seem to just have had it. Dull and unwelcoming, like the food. This place is overhyped. This does not deserve a star, not even a speck of it."
3749,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was so excited to come here b cause of all the reviews but I will say I was underwhelmed. I have the sage fried chicken Benedict. There  was just too much food. The chicken in my opinion was kind dry and did not have much flavor besides the sage. What I didn't like about this dish is that it is not traditional Benedict. The eggs come on the side and they are not poached. The biscuit was very soft and buttery. I loved the chipotle cream sauce that was on top. Overall I would not order this dish again. I will come back here to try other things but this dish is not worth all the hype.

I also had a side order of plain corned beef and it was AMAZING. I am a corned beef fanatic and it definitely hit the spot. I would recommend trying it."
3750,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I been here twice, I enjoyed each meal. Be prepared and hungry the portion are huge. My only issue was you can't ask for any modifications to your meal. Which, I understand but, I would not recommend this place for picky eaters or anyone with food allergies."
3751,Hash House A Go Go,3,"hash house a go go? more like hash house a slow slow, M I Rite?

actually I M not Rite, while we were waiting for seating we were confused as to what the holdup was because the restaurant had empty seats. but it turns out it was maybe our fault because we never told them our whole party had arrived (though our point man claims he did).

Anyway once we sat down the excitement started to build, especially when you see other table's orders arrive. This place is designed for people that eat with their eyes.

Sadly when the food arrived, as a whole it was disappointing. I had chicken/waffles and it was a good rendition but not the best. Other people got other things and while everything looked great on the plate, the general consensus was that the taste was lacking for everyone. Too bad.

For the vegas strip, you could pay a lot more and end up with a lot less so I'd say it was an ok experience. I'm told the other Hash Houses are better so maybe this one is just lacking.

Bathroom was borderline nonexistent, you have to go downstairs and use the casino bathrooms. I didn't have to a go go, so I didn't see it.

So in conclusion, the place was more like Hash House a so-so."
3752,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Pretty sure I died and went to heaven.  Best breakfast I've ever had!! Only about a 25 min wait on a Tuesday morning. Service was excellent. Food and drinks were prompt. Can't complain, would come back again!"
3753,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They charge you for splitting a plate. :(

Probably understandable because everyone would share if they were allowed, the portions are huge- Huge. I've eaten there three times now and each time  it doesn't even look like I put a dent in the food (and who really keeps leftovers in Vegas?). I think they should allow for smaller portions. It would save them money.

The wait can e long. The portions are huge. HUGE.
Chicken and Bacon Waffels were delicious.

It was also featured on Man vs Food FYI."
3754,Hash House A Go Go,5,I heard about this place on Man Vs. Food. And I put it on my to eat list whenever I come to vegas. Tried it for the first time and I absolutely love their Sage Fried Chicken plate. I forgot the name of it. The portion is so huge that two-three people can share. Their MIMOSAS are the best. I love their tangerine mimosa. Great and Friendly service. Get here early because the wait can be pretty long if you come late.
3755,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was a bit skeptical about Hash A Go Go when I first learned that it was located in Imperial Palace. The smell of stale cigarettes that greeted me at the entrance didn't make it any better. Luckily, an escalator ride later, I stepped into the waiting area of Hash House A Go Go realizing that it is practically a different world. While the decor is nothing special it's still a world away from Imperial Palace!

Back to the food-- please come to Hash House A Go Go hungry. Not a little hungry, not ""oh I can still eat"", come STARVING. The portions here are out of this world and even though we're usually pretty big eaters, not a single person finished their plate. Between Mr. Dubs and I, we got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. When they arrived, we were all so intimidated by the presentation and the hearty portions that we really didn't know where to start. Once we started to dig in, it was a whole different story. Eating at Hash House A Go Go really took the terms ""stuffing my face"" to a whole new level. Unfortunately, to my best efforts, I was only able to finish about 1/4 of my meal. 

I also ordered the wine spritzer and loved it. Didn't taste a hint of alcohol. Eva, Denise and Mr. Dubs all ordered the Bloody Mary and it was delicious too but watch out-- they ask you what type of vodka you want in your Blood Mary but doesn't mention that there is an extra charge for the premium vodka! I guess it should've been a given since we are in Vegas and it is ""premium"" but the way the options were given were very misleading. 

Over all, Hash House A Go Go was an experience. Not sure if I'd want to go back but definitely glad I got to check it out!"
3756,Hash House A Go Go,5,Fantastic food and even better service. Great portions and very fair pricing especially for Las Vegas.  We had to wait about 15 minutes but it was worth it. Not many places open at 6 am for breakfast that is not a buffet (we were on central time). Absolutely worth it. Come hungry!
3757,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I would say go early or plan to wait. Breakfast is the busiest time and the pancakes are their specialty. They are HUGE and you can share or prob will need to. The other food seems tiny compared to that pancake..
This trip we decided to go to dinner. We got right in and got a seat didn't have to wait. We had the hamburger and crab cakes, meat loaf sandwich and the chicken biscuits mash potatoes meals. They were very good and huge! The meatloaf was a little dry. The crab cakes were good the hamburger was perfect and all hamburgers come with 2 patties. The chicken and biscuits and potatoes and veggies were very good the flavor was good and I would totally get it again."
3758,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Disappointing. 

We live in San Diego and have been interested in trying the Hash House A Go Go. The singular SD location is always packed with a line out the door; its one of those ""phenomenon"" joints that was on the Food Channel and therefore will now be forever overcrowded.   So on a recent trip to Vegas we decided to take the opportunity to try one of the several HHAGG restaurants there and ended up at the one in the Imperial Palace hotel/casino. 

Having spent much time in the Midwest over the past couple of years, I have become a big fan of Biscuits and Gravy. I saw this on the menu (""Indiana Style"") so I went for it, expecting the HHAGG version of this dish to be a mind-blower.  I noticed that it was served with mashed potatoes, which made me a bit curious.

When the Biscuits and Gravy came it was a disappointment. They put a HUGE pile of mashed potatoes all over the plate, then placed two biscuits on top of the potatoes, then put a SUPER THIN layer of sausage gravy over that. There was barely any sausage, and barely any gravy. The dish was essentially a giant platter of mashed potatoes. Neither the potatoes nor the biscuits were very tasty. I can't comment on the sausage gravy because there really wasn't enough to properly taste and evaluate. 

Service was also very slow considering that there were only a few people in the restaurant when we were there. 

I am glad however that we didn't go the route of waiting 45 minute to 1 hour for a table at the San Diego restaurant only to be let down by the mediocre food.  We won't be going back to the Hash House A Go Go and I won't be recommending it to my friends."
3759,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow the food is amazing ....their slogan I no microwaves and no heat lamps. You guys get the picture. Major sized portions. Vegas at the top of its game. Bring your hangovers and appetites Hash House A Go Go will have the cure
3760,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Second time here... and it was delicious!!!
This time we shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was so massive.  Definitely worth the wait.  Too much to eat alone and we did not want leftovers either."
3761,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Not only does this place have some of the BEST food on the Strip or in the Vegas area for that matter but the portions are ridiculous. By all means get the Chicken and Waffles and share with a hungry friend. I guarantee that you will still bring some home. The loaded mash potatoes & the prawns were wonderful. The only issue I could possibly have is that it took a minute to find the actual restaurant. We had to park way in the back and work our way forward to the casino, then it was a guessing game to figure out which way from there, but every wrong turn was worth it!!!"
3762,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is kinda busy. But the waiting time wasn't too bad just about 15mins. People are very friendly. 

As the waiters recommendation, we ordered Andy's sage fried chicken and meatloaf hash. The fried chicken was very heavy, saucy. SUPER BIG PORTIONS!!! Should be for 2 people to share. I personally love the meatloaf hash better, it was very tasty."
3763,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Stopped in on a weekday at 7am hoping to beat the long wait I'd read so much about. 

Not a chance. There were so many people sitting down waiting so we decided it would be best to order out. Stopped at the bar, ordered promptly, was shocked at the giant bag for our two plates. Got up to our hotel room (we stayed at the LINQ) and I broke my to go box pulling it out of the bag. That's how heavy it was! 

There was a ridiculous amount of food! I ordered the fried chicken Benedict (the one without the maple reduction) and it fed me for two days. TWO DAYS!!! Service at the bar was friendly when we placed our order, food was good, and quality was nice. Our food even came with some fruit which they kindly put in separate containers so they wouldn't get mushy from the heat. I appreciated the little touches, there was also a paper bag with rosemary to garnish which was quite kind. I put some in my mashed potatoes and it was amazing!! 

Thank you! I'll definitely come by again next time I'm in the area!!"
3764,Hash House A Go Go,5,"absolutely nothing to complain about. went to vegas this past weekend and was with 2 friends. one of them mentioned this place so we decided to try it. i had the chorizo hash, it was so tasty, spicey and delicious. i also had a bloody mary that was amazing. one friend got the chicken with waffles which were awesome and beautifully presented. the other friend got the artichoke hash, this was the lightest of the meals, and also tasted great. it is a lot, i mean a lot, of food per plate. i will go back."
3765,Hash House A Go Go,1,Horrible!!!!!!! Went on halloween night to get served by absolutely the worst waiter possible. Expensive and food was FREAKING LUKEWARM PICK UP UR SHIT HASH HOUSE
3766,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome food and awesome service.  We arrived around 8:45am on a Friday and waited about 20 minutes, not too bad.  Our server, Lonzo, was quick and knowledgeable.  We ordered the famous Chicken and waffles and the corned beef hash breakfast.  Both did not disappoint.  Hash House A GoGo is WORTH the wait Vegas Diners!  It is inside the Linq Hotel, on the second floor."
3767,Hash House A Go Go,4,Sage fried chicken Benedict!! Portions are huge!!! You will knock out after dining here. I recommend sharing.
3768,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is always a fun dinner after a show, or drinking. It's always been a light relaxed room with laughter at several table as people are served for the first time. 
  Realize people will be watching you eat as they are seated. Everyone looks around at everyone else trying to figure out what these enormous plates are, and how in the world one person is going to eat everything on there plate.
  The truth is they are finishing it the next day for lunch, or breakfast."
3769,Hash House A Go Go,4,Fantastic appetite satisfying hamburgers in a pretty dumpy setting.
3770,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Back in Vegas again this weekend, just left the HH a go go at the Linq. Again exceeding long wait times to be seated and served. On a different note Sassy is AWESOME!"
3771,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Absolutely probably one of the coolest places to eat around Vegas. Got the cheese burger, so good. But overal wait time was a bit long but the experience was priceless"
3772,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Okay the wait was kinda slow but they were offering low cost drinks during it. The waiting area was a little small and stuffy, that was just about the only thing I didn't like about this place. It is a very popular place for a reason which is why I was surprised by the waiting area but on to the food. I ordered the Man Vs Food special they had and Oh my GOODNESS! It was bigger than my head and it was truly scrumptious! My boyfriend ordered waffles with the regular sides which he demolished (he is very pick so that means something). If you are on the verge of starving this is the perfect destination because all the portions were unbelievably huge as in me and my boyfriend could have been stuffed on just my plate alone and the prices are moderate so it really was amazing. I would definitely recommend to anyone in vegas!"
3773,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hash House A No No!

Had the famous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken (which comes with one piece of fried chicken, lots of mashed potatoes, two strips of crispy bacon, a large biscuit and two eggs)... was not impressed, kind of dry, not super flavorful.

Steel cut oatmeal was good. The fresh fruit that went with it wasn't so fresh. 

Some of the servers are awesome, some are just okay. A bit overpriced. I'd rather go to Ellis Island."
3774,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I used to com here all the time ... when it was the best secret in Las Vegas , now there is a bit of a wait when we go but if you haven't dined here you must go 
Great food good drinks and bring your camera if you order the chicken and waffles"
3775,Hash House A Go Go,4,Come hungry.  The chicken & waffles and tractor driver combo are both really good.  Make sure you go the restroom downstairs in the casino.
3776,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Portions were huge, food was at best average. We were grossed out by the quantity of food and average taste. Would not go back."
3777,Hash House A Go Go,5,"what size portion can a real human actually eat without exploding? i was about to find out. 
the food here (breakfast food anyway) was absolutely divine! i had the french toast with eggs and potatoes and will all my will, was able to finish it. my gal had a mango coconut pancake and it was bigger than her head. i had to help her finish it (what can i say, it was a severely gluttinous weekend). 
our service was prompt despite there was a 40 minute wait (we were seated in 10, so don't let that stop you). the coffee was deliciously strong. our waitress was perfect...not overbearing, not absent....just the right amount of both. 

our travel mate got something with eggs and chicken and hollandaise. it looked terrible to me, but she said it was fantastic. couldn't finish it. 

and the bloody marys are just as large and just as delicious. this place rocks! very cheap for the amount of food you get."
3778,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Unnecessary large portions. I hated wasting so much food. However, service was great and the bloody mary was yummy!"
3779,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It's in the LINQ hotel which was underwhelming at best in regards to accommodations, this place however is great. I wish I had a diner like this place in my city. Huge portions, good flavor, the sausage gravy I got a side of for my mashed red bliss was awesome. 

It was everything that I wanted and exceeded my expectations. My coworker and I let full and satisfied. Prices were reasonable for the amount of food and quality."
3780,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Hash House A No Go!
Hype. Poor service. Noise.
I've wanted to visit this place since I saw the Man vs. Food episode many years ago. So disappointing. It is incredibly noisy and crowded. My husband used his earplugs to handle the din. We had a 45 minute wait. We stood at the bar for a Bloody Mary to pass the time, waited 10 minutes before borrowing the menu from the folks next to us, and were noticed 15 minutes later, went with the bartender suggested upgrade on the vodka for $2 more for a total tab of $26. Rough start, but still hopeful. My place setting had a dirty spoon. I ignored, knowing that sometimes dishwashers miss things. After about 15 minutes, our server took our order...Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict, OJ, coffee, side of ""bacon, bacon, bacon"" and another Bloody Mary. Drinks took a while; I had to ask three times to two different servers for milk for my coffee. Bacon ordered as an appetizer came with the entree. We had to ask two different staff again for side plates so that we could share the dish. Although the presentation was photo worthy in terms of sheer size, our food was barely lukewarm. The tomato slices were a faint red; there were a few sprinkled raw spinach leaves, the equivalent of a single scrambled egg, and a large, but dry chicken breast. The mashed potatoes under the tower of calories weren't even lukewarm and roughly mashed with large chunks of potatoes and very little seasoning. And here's the rub... the server brought back a boxed glass like the one the third Bloody Mary was served in; I stopped him and said  that we hadn't ordered the glass, and he explained that it came with the drink. ( Although the  very same drinks at the bar did not come with a glass.) Looked at the bill and found that the upgrade in vodka this time raised the drink price to $21.99. I wanted to dispute the charge, but the husband was done and really didn't want to wait around for the server any longer. I felt that the ""upsell"" was dishonest and very much a swindle. We will not be back again."
3781,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After years of wanting to try this place out, I finally did this past Sunday before heading home from Vegas. For the 2 of us to be seated, we waited 30 minutes but it seems like the wait time is typically longer. Our waiter was really friendly, and explained a bit about the menu to us since it was our first time. He checked in frequently as we decided what we wanted to eat and drink. We were never waiting for him to show up at the table. My sister and I split the chicken and rosemary hash with scrambled eggs and were both filled up. The potatoes were the best part of the dish, so flavorful and perfectly cooked. Besides beer they also have some fun mixed drinks available such as spiked kiwi watermelon lemonade. Other offerings include scrambles, giant salads, and stuffed burgers. Come here for some heavy food if you need to cure that Vegas hangover!"
3782,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Everything was AMAZING! We waited 45 minutes for our table (8 of us) we were so starving by the tine we sat down! Our server (Courtney) was the BEST! She recommended the Chicken Benedict and the Chorizo Quesadilla and boy was she spot on. We also got the snickers pancake and the Chicken and waffles. All the dishes were delicious! Our service was surprisingly fast even though she informed us that she was going to ring in our food order before she brought our drinks because the food takes a little longer than most restaurants because everything is cooked to order. I think we waited about 20 min or so. Even though it was extremely busy, our drinks stayed full, Courtney checked on us several times and always promptly got us any requests (syrup, butter, napkins etc.) It appeared to only be 2 servers in the dinning area we were in, she let us know in the begining that we could also ask the other server if we needed anything. He was also very helpful and checked on us a few times (I don't remember his name, but he must have been 7 ft tall) she split our check several ways wich was nice since a lot of places on the strip wont. Reasonably priced for Vegas, especially since the portions are huge! If I had to give any constructive criticism, it would be for the girls up front at the wait stand could be a little friendlier (both African American and really rude) I was worried at first thinking all staff was going to be rude, but that wasn't the case at all. Everything else was perfect. Came back the next day for dinner and the service was OK. Definitely a different vibe at breakfast. Ill Definitely be back in July, and hopefully Courtney and the giant will be our servers again. Thank you Courtney and Hash House for a great 2.5 hours."
3783,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I first discovered hash house in San Diego about 6 years ago. It was LOVE at first bite!!! We would sometimes drive from Los angles to San Diego just for their breakfast. Once we found this location in Vegas it became a must do for breakfast each time we were in Vegas. So we've been here about 4-5 times and the quality seems to be lacking more and more with each trip. I think it's a must eat if you've never been but then the novelty kinda wears off! I don't think we'll be going back, but it was good while it lasted. I definitely recommend the griddled mashed potatoes, sausage and biscuit. My husband loved the pancake with the bananas. Portions are very large. It's worth a visit."
3784,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The previous reviews are right-  one portion is definitely enough for 2 people.  But because we really wanted to try two things, we got the smoked salmon scramble (so yummy, definitely recommended, and oh gosh the strawberry jam that comes with the corn bread) and the fried chicken benefits- ( totally amazing -love their sauce).  Service wasn't the most attentive thing, but good enough. We would come
back definitely, such a great place for brunch."
3785,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is the Linq Hotel location. Do yourself a favor and come in off Flamingo Drive and turn onto Linq Lane. Much easier to get in that way. Prices $12-$25. Good good food. A bit dim but nice casual vibe. Big portions. Something for everyone. Breakfast all day. Same with brunch. Dinner after 5pm. And OMG the BLT Bloody Mary is to die for. Best $12 I've spent in Vegas!
3786,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Have eaten at the Hash House in San Diego a few time before.  Found out there Is one in Vegas and had to try this one.  For the price it's one of the best breakfast by far you can get.  If there is a Hash House near you, you need to eat there."
3787,Hash House A Go Go,1,Ain't this some bullshit!! Waited an hour in line for this nasty ass sage chicken and waffles covered in some smelly ass rosemary. Worst food i ever had!!! Roscoe's is way better than this junk! What a dissapointment!!
3788,Hash House A Go Go,4,Been here twice and everytime I go the wait is crazyyyyyy. Brunch... more like eat this and be full for the rest of the day with only eating half of the portion! The staff is always friendly and attentive. At least you can have a mimosa or a bloody mary while waiting :)
3789,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was great. Best hangover food ever and if you got one I recommend the ""Hair of the Dog"". This place has some truly outrageous food, some to outrageous. The only bad thing is THE SERVICE IS S#!**y."
3790,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ordered steak and eggs & the corned beef plate: so damn good! The serving size was excellent and service was great (at 3am too)! 

The price is pretty good, like $20 plate. Considering that it's 24/7, it's overall a good bet to eat at as opposed to other late night restaurants.

Loved it, took leftovers to go, will be back next time."
3791,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had to come here, just because it is famous.  I guess it's a necessary evil in Vegas that you need to walk through a filthy and disgusting casino to get to most eateries and this one is no different.  In fact, it is difficult to find if you've never been inside the Imperial Palace.

My wife ordered the Smoked Salmon Scramble.  It was delicious.  I had the Pork Benny, also delicious.

Here's my issue.  The portions are HUGE!!  I am a big eater and I had to force myself to eat half of the Pork Benny.  How can a place justify selling these large portions while there are 50 homeless people out front.  It doesn't sit well with my conscience.

I guess my wife and I can say that we've tried this place, just for the novelty.  If we make it back to Vegas, this won't be on our return list.  There are other places that we need to try."
3792,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I literally can't think of anything wrong with this establishment. From food, to customer service, to overall look and feel of the restaurant, it definitely warrants 5 stars. 

Quality and quantity are the key words here. The portion sizes are fit for kings and queens. HUGE! My husband and I have yet to finish a full meal here. The waffles, chicken, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, french toast and many other dishes are so large that they could use their own individual plates! The meals are also vertical, literally. The food is piled on top of itself as you can see in many of the photos. The presentation and plating is stellar. As soon as you see your food, you're amazed! 

The quality of the food and seasonings are top notch. One of their little catch phrases is ""twisted farm food"", which definitely holds true. They even tell you when you order that everything is made to order, that they don't use any heat lamps, and that your food may come out in separate pieces and separate times. This is so awesome to me and ensures that my food is fresh. Even the juice is fresh squeezed when you order it, so it may take a few mins to arrive. 

The setup of the restaurant is really cool, roomy, kind of dark, and overall has a great vibe. We haven't had one bad customer service problem here. The wait staff is fantastic, and they all look genuinely happy to be working there. The main thing I noticed is that there are a million and one employees here. You see them zipping back and forth the whole time you're there. The staff is also VERY diverse as far as appearance and ethnicity. 

Be prepared for somewhat of a wait at this location. Eating at a restaurant such as Hash House A Go Go is definitely a priority for MANY people when they come to Vegas--myself included!"
3793,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My husband and I ate here on a Sunday morning around 9 am.  It was very convenient since we were staying at the Linq.  It was busy and there was a wait of about 20 minutes which wasn't bad.  We both got the sausage gravy over biscuits with scrambled eggs on top.  It was supposed to come on top of mashed potatoes but we requested we wanted it on top of hash browns.  The hash browns were large fried potato chucks that tasted like the potato wasn't cooked but the outside tasted burnt.  The sausage gravy, biscuits and egg were good but nothing out of this world.  I would give them another shot and try something different but I wasn't as impressed as everyone lead this place to be."
3794,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This was a decently priced meal, and when I say meal, you better not have eaten at all in the past eight hours before you ascend that escalator.

I had the sage-fried chicken, which was very tasty and satisfying to the soul. I can see where this place can come in handy for the drunk and the hungover that can lurk around Vegas in the wee hours of the morning and the late hours of the light-studded night. This was definitely the star inside the LINQ, and the size of the plates established that. I had a great experience with the service there, and overall, this was a great lunch (should I say brunch?) option!"
3795,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food is awesome here, had the bacon waffle and scrambled eggs with cheese. Hearty portion"
3796,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great breakfast or lunch spot! Food was amazing - portions are huge, would recommend sharing.  Only complaint was that it's was 100 degrees in the restaurant with little ventilation - quite stuffy. Overall great food and a great value for Vegas."
3797,Hash House A Go Go,2,"For one of the most famous restaurants in LV, we were certainly disappointed with our meals. 
Our party of 6 arrived on Sunday morning around 11am. The wait line was out of control and we immediately assumed that we'd have to go somewhere else, but decided to ask how long the wait would be. Fortunately (or unfortunately since it wasn't good) a party of 6 had just cancelled and they were the only party of 6 in front of us in line, so we were able to just take their spot and only waited about 5 minutes. 

We were seated and did have to wait a while for someone to take our drink orders, but they were crazy busy, so ok. 

I'll skip to the reasons for the 2 star review, simply put, out of 6 of us, nobody really liked their food and none of us would go again. 

--2 ladies got the hash with basil, artichoke, etc.--they said it was cold and very very bland
--1 lady got the apple cinnamon flapjack--it was very tough and pretty much impossible to eat. it was also very dry.
--1 lady got the BBBLT-- she didn't like the bread, too thick
--I got the jalapeno guacamole burger--there was something bitter on this and I could barely eat it
--The last lady got the Rancher Eggs Benedict per the recommendation of the waitress. It was served with a BRICK of mashed potatoes underneath it. She kind of picked around everything, but it just looked like a soggy mess and wasn't appetizing...not impressed by something that was recommending. 


The prices were reasonable for the ammt. of food you got- everything was HUGE, but nothing was good. 

The only thing that I tried and liked was the biscuit that came with some of the hashes and the strawberry jam stuff for the biscuit, both were quite good. Again, the service was OK for as crowded as it was, but I wouldn't say the service was ""good"".

I wouldn't recommend this place and I wouldn't return."
3798,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Deliciousness wrapped in a layer of Vegas fun... little too crowded during lunch but plenty of food served, 4 stars"
3799,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yummmmers!!

The portions are huge, and the presentation impressive. The food suffers a little due to the large portion size, but just made sure to eat half and bring the rest home. Heat up the leftovers and eat it with tabasco sauce or siracha. Then its all good."
3800,Hash House A Go Go,4,Went there for breakfast and was seated quickly. The restaurant is cozy and not very quiet. The service was excellent. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly. She made sure we had no questions unanswered. Overall good time. One work of caution is that the portions are very large. If you try and eat it all you might as well head back to your room as you will not be a functional person for several hours.
3801,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had the dish featured on Man vs. Food(can't remember the name) and it was awesome.  A lot of food as expected, but it had a ton of flavor.  I never would have thought all the ingredients would be so good together.  The price was also very reasonable, compared to many other places on the strip.  

If I had a complaint, the restaurant is very loud because they are always packed, but almost every restaurant in Vegas is loud."
3802,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy cow... food is GINORMOUS and super tasty...the breakfast quesadilla, real good, the biscuits and gravy, real good, the scrambler with goat cheese and sun dried tomatos, real good and the mango coconut pancakes, real good.  Everything was real good and when I am in Vegas I'll be eating here again!"
3803,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The first time they brought my food out, and this is not the first time that I have them here, the chicken was old and the eggs were lukewarm. That being said I understand that it's not the servers fault. After I sent it back the second round was amazing. Everything that I expect from this restaurant. Definitely a five star every time, and it was on man versus food and diners drive-ins and dives. It is amazing!"
3804,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Coming into Vegas, I researched a ton to make sure I get to the best places. Realized that the portion sizes were huge! So me and my mom split the benedict with rosemary chicken, It was awesome! Great cocoa too!"
3805,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Can be a very long wait so we ordered take-out. The price is fair for the food, but they only gave us one utensil for 2 people... so we had to share. Food was filling, just a little odd that my order came in a pizza box."
3806,Hash House A Go Go,5,"For the first time ever we decided to try Hash House for a meal other than breakfast - and we were so glad we did.  I ordered the Meatball Pasta - which was actually reasonably sized (if you've been here you know what I mean) compared to other entrees.  Five rather nice sized and delicious meatballs were underneath a bed of perfectly cooked thick spaghetti and a great marinara with chunks of sweet tomatoes.  I ate the whole damn thing.  Outstanding.  My wife went with the Baby sized burger, which is still bigger than 3/4 of the burgers out there and it was also outstanding.  The highlight was the Cheddar Cheese Bacon potatoes on the side.  If you like that tasty cheese that slightly burns on the edge of a grilled cheese, you'll get a small plateful of it on top of delicious potatoes.  Drinks were also good, and all of this for an extremely reasonable price with OUTSTANDING service.  We will be back here again!!"
3807,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Stopped by while in town on vacation to grab food from this well reviewed eatery and it def lived up to its reviews ... I enjoyed the restaurant , the service, food and drinks I wish we had one closer to me in jersey ...  nonetheless it gives me a reason to come back to VEGAS ... TRY IT"
3808,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was amazing! Went here on a recommendation and it was incredible. Huge food portions, approximately termed 'comfort food on steroids,' friendly fast helpful and fun waiter. There wasn't anything that could have been done to improve the meal or the experience. You may want to share the huge platters of food or plan to take it home. We did a round robin so we could all try the differet dishes, it was a good call and they were all great."
3809,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and large portions. Wait time was about 20 minutes. Good stuff! I would eat here again for breakfast anytime. Staff was nice as well. Really cool place in the heart of Las Vegas.

Tip only order small amounts because they send huge portions out."
3810,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place was great! It was a little crowded when I went but it was well worth the wait. You must bring your apatite because the serving sized are huge.
3811,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food here is incredibly large.  This can be a plus if you are open to sharing.  You can order a bunch of dishes and swap, like we did.  Is that uncouth?  I don't care.

Pros:
 - Large portions
 - Pretty Good Food (I recommend the quesadilla)
 - Children's Menu with decent offerings

Cons:
 - I don't know what is going on in this hotel (now called The Quad), but it was so hot inside the restaurant that I felt like I was going to pass out.
 - The location of the restaurant is terrible.  It is in a undesirable hotel in an undesirable location within the hotel.
 - The service was not bad, but it was not good.

Let's call this three and a half stars."
3812,Hash House A Go Go,5,The bomb. Long wait but if you keep you eye on the bar sit there. If it's just a party of 2. Worth the wait. Big portions. Come with an appetite. I ordered 2 bloody Mary's and a screwdriver. Left full and drunk. Great place. $65 for a party of 2.
3813,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you come hungry - very hungry - and looking for tasty comfort food you will find a whole lot to love about Hash House A Go Go. And by whole lot I mean way huge servings. You've been warned.

The atmosphere is fun casual and they deliver on every bit of it - throw pillows on the seats and ""Country Industrial"" design. Their ""Twisted Farm Food"" is a nice diner menu with emphasis on breakfast and brunch. Every creative dish is farm fresh and seasoned to absolute perfection. They really create full flavor dishes like Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles, Chorizo Hash or Smoked Salmon Benedict. 

And they don't shy away from a full dinner menu with Grilled Pork Tenderloin or Chili Crusted Duck Breast or big salads, burgers and even steaks. And yes, they also have a Late Breakfast menu during dinner hour.

Full bar? Of course. And their prices are a nice departure from most of the sky-high Vegas fare. Servers are friendly and helpful. They've become a regular stop when visiting Vegas - 3 times and looking forward to the next. You can't hardly go wrong here."
3814,Hash House A Go Go,4,"For hours after I ate at Hash House A Go Go, I was wondering what on earth I did to my body. How many actual pounds of food did I ingest, and why, did I challenge myself to eat all of it? To be fair, I FAILED the challenge, but tried really hard.

Arrived around 11:30 AM on a Monday, and the wait for 2 was an accurate 35 minutes. Service was prompt, and while the wait for food itself was going to be about 40 minutes, our server was able to get our drinks and a small order of sweet potato fries out to us really quickly. The Tangerine Honey Screwdriver is a great twist on a classic cocktail, so I'd definitely recommend it.

We ordered the towering Chicken & Waffles, the Pot Pie, and a side of biscuits and gravy (""Do you know how much food that is?"" asks our server. ""Yes"", I say, ""I just REALLY want to try all of it."") While the C&W is impressive in presentation, it was probably my least favorite on the list, though it wasn't bad at all. The pot pie was really great - whatever is in their gravy is just on point. So flavorful. And their biscuits and gravy is just perfect. A bit of spice, the meat is awesome, and the biscuits were light and fluffy.

Probably someplace I'd go back to if I were in Vegas again and wanted to torture my body. But perhaps I'd share a meal next time."
3815,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing restaurant. Great food. The best service.  Muy buen restaurante buena comida y excelente servicio.
3816,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Weekend wait here is horrible.  Over 45minutes plus.  Food portion is HUGE!  One plate can feed three petite asian girls! haha.  The only reason I would come back here is if I come in a big group so we could order different type of dishes and share.  Some of the food are good and some are just ok.  It's a good place to try if you've never been.  For me, it's just not worth the time wait."
3817,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food was amazing, huge portions!!  The pancake takes up the whole plate, the potatoes were crispy and tasty.  Rhonda R was our waitress and she was OUTSTANDING!!!  A must go!  A little noisy if you're hungover though!"
3818,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great tasting food and good size portions.  We split all are meals.  Was introduced to a new ale I had not tried called Arrogant Bastard from Stone Brewery...give it a try.
3819,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here for brunch on Labor Day and wow.  Portions are UNREAL!! We wanted to check it out after seeing it on tv and it was well worth it!  Prices were great considering how much you get altho if you're just there on a trip, it's a LOT of food.  One dish can definitely feed 2-3 people easily.   We didnt finish any of our food and didnt pack it to go since it was ridiculously hot in Vegas and it'd be wasted anyways.

*Sage fried chicken and bacon waffles: O M G. I'm not a white meat person and yet i totally ate this one.  It was juicy and delicious!!! totally going to make bacon waffles at home like that now.  YUM!
*Crispy hand hammered  pork tenderloin topped with scrambled eggs: this looked like a man vs food dish.  It was THAT big.  The tenderloin was the size of the huge plate and covered up the HUGE portion of bacon mash potatoes underneath which was also topped with 2 full size biscuits and tomatoes.  Had a small side of fruit to make it healthy haha super delicious but def feeds more than one person

we were totally stuffed and our plates still had about half our food on it.  We hate being wasteful but there's no way we could've finished.  Now we know next time to split a dish altho it was def worth trying 2 dishes :)  We rolled out of there and walked it off around the casinos!

if you havent been here, GO!!"
3820,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First time and definitely a repeater. Tip:  try the crispy potatoes. The Kokomo was deliciously as was the corned beef hash which was made fresh (pulled corned beef), not canned.

Service was great and friendly. Definitely a repeater."
3821,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Layover in Vegas, needed a meal, where else would we go. Love the place. The food portions are massive and excellent. Every time we are here we make a visit."
3822,Hash House A Go Go,4,1st breakfast in Vegas. It was worth the money. Approx $14 gets you enough food for two! It was tasty and the service was great. Would definitely go back.
3823,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Homestyle uuber sized portions! Check out my honey's tower of chicken and waffle! This was the best part of our trip. Was not hungry so I ordered one flap jack. It was huge. Could not finish. Sorry mom. Missing one more star because we had to walk in a maze to get to the spot -- but it was worth it...but then the wait was close to 2 hours! We snuck up on the bar patrons and stalked them until two people finished their lunch. That took about 20 mins, not bad. Also missing the last star because they do Not have a bathroom - whattt??"
3824,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I must say the fried chicken was below expectation, it was dry, bland and over-fried.  The waffles were just ok.  The portion was big, too big in my opinion.  I think they should focus on the quality rather than the quantity."
3825,Hash House A Go Go,5,A. Ma. Zing. The waiter suggested that my husband and I split the French toast and the sage fried chicken Benedict for a little sweet/salty mix and it was ridiculous!!! Highly recommend!!
3826,Hash House A Go Go,4,Went for Sunday breakfast around 9am.  It was packed but wait was about 15 minutes...perfectly reasonable.  Great unique atmosphere.  Friendly staff.  Food was king size proportions and most of the menu items have a unique flair.  Love tangerine juice.
3827,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is amazing. Very fresh but wayyyyyyy too big of servings!!! I was actually sick when we went there and couldn't taste or smell but I could tell it was quality that's how good it was! I can't wait to go back!!!
3828,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came for brunch & it was worth the little wait.  I've been to the location in San Diego but the Vegas location seemed completely different.

Soooo do not over order.  One plate is enough for 2-3 very hungry people.  The portion size is huge!  Food is delicious but it's overwhelming.  Everything comes with some sort of potato so if you love potatoes, this is your spot!  I tried the salmon Benedict & was pleasantly surprised with how much flavor it had."
3829,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great Chicken and Waffles.   Very crowded so eat at the bar.
3830,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you're not the breakfast buffet type, you MUST come here. It's life-changing. And it's always open, so stuff yourself whenever the mood strikes.

I came with my boyfriend right before the breakfast rush, and we are so thankful we beat the crowd. Among the people who approve of this place: Dr. Phil and Jon Taffer.

I got what sounded like the perfect vegetarian hash: sundried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, eggs and a biscuit. My BF got a quesadilla. Now, when we first ordered we had a little moment of ""oh god, how much is this going to cost us?"" And THEN we saw the portions. They are phenomenal. They could easily feed 2 people. Or easily nurse a hangover.

Our food arrived pretty fast...and it was hash house HEAVEN. My picky eating partner said it was his favorite thing he's ever eaten, and I was blown away by my fabulous meal. Considering the size and the flavor, the prices were just right.

As a bonus - the drinks are cool! Get a boozy coffee concoction or a beer in a brown bag (lol).

You simply can't go one more Vegas breakfast without coming here."
3831,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Come hungry. And come with a large group. They have special large group tables so even when the place is busy they can seat large parties fast. Everything is really good, you just have to decide what you're hungry for. I think the best value is the Tractor Combo. You can choose pancakes, French toast, or waffles. I would have given HH 5 stars but they didn't have a restroom on location in order for me to make more room for all the goodness that is their food. Highly recommended and ask for Damon's section, awesome service."
3832,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Share a meal!!! The waiter told us the portions were big, so we shared. Good thing. If we hadn't, we would have over spent. I shared the chicken and waffles with one son, my husband shared a hash plate with another son, The two little ones ordered from the kids menu, and their pancakes were huge. 
The food was yum, plated nicely, and good. The kids really wanted to go here after seeing it on TV. Glad we did, next time we're in town we'll drop by again,"
3833,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy crap Batman!

This place was amazing! Only waited 15-20 minutes for a table for 3. Bigger groups beware as it seems to be busy all day long.

What we ordered:
2x Sage Fried Chicken N Waffles
1x Sage Fried Chicken Benedict
2 Coffee drinks (Something with mint... cant remember!)

I am only reviewing the Chicken n Waffles portion.
Chicken was very flavorful, juicy, and piping hot! The waffles we soft and fluffy, also there was bacon in them too! I've had chicken n waffles elsewhere and this by far is the largest portion provided. The waiter mentioned they were large, but this was ridiculous! 
The food was good overall, but the main downside is that none of us finished any of our dishes. I want to say about 20% remained unfortunately after eating way too much!

I recommend to share with people. Each dish easily feeds 2-3, maybe more, but it is still worth to try them out.

There are other Hash Houses in Vegas but this was the closest for us."
3834,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Thurs 1/22, 11 am. Just made it in before the lunch rush. It was still busy with a short 10 min wait. 

This was my first visit to a Hash House. I shared a dish with my friend - salmon scramble. It was good. Not the best, but good. The biscuit was good. The homemade strawberry jam was very good. Not too sweet, which I prefer.

Service was fast friendly and attentive. 

I would go back."
3835,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome brunch place to eat at with friends. I went with two of my girl friends to the location at the Linq. There was about a 30 minute wait. We ended up sharing the chicken and waffles and the crab cake benedict. We didn't finish either of them!!! They were humongous!!! However, they were both delicious. The crab cake benedict comes on top of mashed potatoes. It's literally the size of a football. I suggest sharing if you go!"
3836,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The Sage Fried Chicken is exactly what you expect. Giant and delicious. You could definitely share this with someone but why would you! Order the flap jacks, they are to die for! Will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas."
3837,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Another bkft crush here at HH. The Blue Crab Eggs Benedict dethroned Andy's Sage Chicken Bennie as the king of bkft. Great flavor and the cream sauce had a nice kick to it.

They do take RSVPs weekdays if made 24hrs in advance; that saved us a good 30 minute wait. Only negative is that their prices are creeping higher and higher, but not bad once you consider that almost every plate can be shared by two people. This place is a must."
3838,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We had a group of 15 for dinner!! The service was great with good banter and very helpful staff. 

The meals are HUGEEEEEEEEEE I'm not exaggerating.  HUGE! my husband and I shared the sage chicken benedict. We couldn't even finish it.  It was super tasty though! And it was so good even though we were stuffed we kept eating it. 

Highly recommend the cheese mash.... Holy crap it's good.

The meatballs are sooooo flavourful. But if you want to challenge your friend to something they could never finish (like we did for a laugh)  the chicken and waffles are soooooooooooo big. God bless him he tried.... poor kid didn't stand a chance.  

All in all it is reasonably priced. Every meal I saw could of easily been shared with 2 if not 3 people. Service with a smile. Good location in the quad hotel."
3839,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for my last meal of the year and oh boy- I was completely satisfied! I had a burger and not only was it delicious and juicy it was perfect! The sizes are huge- totally worth the price. The service is great, staff was kind and friendly even though they were super busy-it's always nice to see staff enjoy their work. Will definitely be back soon- 100% worth the wait!"
3840,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service: 4 stars
Wow factor: 4 stars
Food: 3 stars

I had the famous fried chicken Benedict and it was just ok. I wish it was smothered in gravy versus the chipotle sauce used. The fried chicken was cooked well and the breading was bomb. The chipotle sauce was only OK and overpowered the fried chicken. I loved that it was served over biscuits but would have preferred the potatoes on the side versus under. It got mushy. I almost wished there was more sauce or something, the biscuits were really dry.

My boyfriend ordered the meatloaf. That was really good. They slice the meatloaf and crisp it up. The flavor was really good.

We also got an iced pistachio mocha, you could really taste the pistachio flavor. Would recommend to any pistachio lovers. My boyfriend barely made a dent in his caramel mocha and got jittery! He rarely gets jittery too so watch out for that!

All in all the huge portions make this a fun place to go to. Service is great and the menu is brimming with fantastic items that are sure to impress. We came with leftovers for dinner. A great bang for your buck. You could split a dish too if you don't like leftovers and get an even better deal! Check it out if you're staying close by and are going with a group who isn't intimidating by giant portions!"
3841,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yep-  the massive Chicken and waffles is a great choice to share!  4 waffles (bacon inside which my son promptly snagged) and gorgeous chicken... delectable.  Perfectly crunchy and moist.  My husband and I couldn't finish it, and we shared it!  The kids burger $5.99 w/ fries was delicious! I helped myself to the seasoned fries... so yummy! 

Place is super convenient as it is on the Monorail route (7 min walk) and open 24 hrs."
3842,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Portions are huge, flavors are meh. A lot of their brunch items come with a heaping mass of mashed potatoes underneath the meal.  Honestly it's a massive amount of food but I think the flavors are bland. There are other more scrumptious brunch places. 

Service is always good and it's a popular place so there might be a little wait."
3843,Hash House A Go Go,1,Horrible service will never come back. Manager isn't adequate to handle this restaurant. Food isn't worth the poor service.
3844,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The whole experience was definitely not indicative of a 4star venue. The food was good, but the service, decor, and ambiance felt like a convalescent home with a 4 star chef."
3845,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We LOVE this place. We never come to Vegas without visiting! Dinner is our favorite as you get more bang for your buck! We took friends with us and told them to get the meatloaf (AMAZING), they opted for the Sage Chicken and waffles and were disappointed! The meatloaf is our favorite. Their salads are good and their burgers are good. Breakfast is Delish but not quite as much bang for your buck! ALL plates are big enough to share!!"
3846,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always, I love hash house. One of the best American breakfast places. Their portions are huge so I recommend sharing dishes. My favorites were hash with chorizo, flapjack with brown sugar and banana, and chicken and waffles.  The only downside of this location is the line is SUPER long. I have waited nearly an hour before and I also waited 50 min again. I suggest going down to put your name down if you stay at linq"
3847,Hash House A Go Go,4,"my husband and i loved this place, the portions are huge food was tasty and the staff were quick. we will be back. only bad thing i can say is they have no turkey substitutes ..."
3848,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ehh mixed feelings.

So after having this place hyped up by one of my buddies, I was really excited since i like a good breakfast. And i LOVE a good breakfast after a hard night of drinking..which is where this review will begin! lol

So when we get to Imperial Palace, we find Hash House and it's swarmed by people waiting to get in.  The hostess informs us that it's about an hour wait time to get seated..$10 and 5 minutes later, we were seated haha

I know it was busy and all, but it took absolutely forever to take our orders, bring out drinks, and bring out our food.  So service you can was average at the best. Our waitress was nice when we did see her, but that was rare.

I opted for the world famous sage fried chicken and waffles. the chicken was really good! the batter was light and flavorful. the waffles had huge strips of bacon inside them. however, besides that there was nothing special about them.  batter they used was a little heavy, and the waffle itself was uneventful. 

Pricing is good for the Strip. Most dishes were around $15 and portions were huge and easily shared. 

Maybe I was expecting too much? But this place wasn't all that cracked out. The food was average at best. If I hadn't greased the hostess, this meal would have taken more then 2 hours if you include the wait time.

I'd eat here again though, but maybe on a weekday and a different dish!"
3849,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is the BEST! Only down side is they told us 30-45 minutes for a table and you all have to present to be sat (three of our friends were just down the steps) or they give your table away. ANYWAY, the food was amazing, five of us got the sage egg Benedict. It was the best one ever and it is huge (you can split it with 3/4 people unless you are super hungry). The service is good but the food takes 40 mins or so to get to the table (it's cooked fresh) definitely can not wait to come back"
3850,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was a pleasant surprise! Hands down one of the best meals I had in Las Vegas. I ordered the s'mores mocha for my morning coffee and it was amazing.  The chicken and waffles was delicious.  The chicken was moist and the waffle was done to perfection. The portions are huge so it is best to split your meal with someone.
3851,Hash House A Go Go,4,"good.. huge plates, had the pancake it was massive! Buddies had the chicken and waffles.. little too much sage but good."
3852,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Absolutely loved the taste of the HH BURGER $12 . Presentation 5 stars .Although the section they sat us at was horribly loud with the tossing of Silverware. For our next visit , I'll try and be more aware of the seating placement .
-LuiggyD"
3853,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions! Always seems to be busy but worth it, if you can handle a wait... BLT Bloody Mary's are amazing"
3854,Hash House A Go Go,4,"this place was fun. came here with 6 girls, shared 3 GINORMOUS plates and had left overs. our bellies were full and VERY happy. the wait wasn't too bad. it was a saturday during the lunch rush but we only waited about 20 min.

i highly recommend the hammered pork tenderloin sandwich. the pork was breaded and super tender. all it needed was some tonkatsu sauce but ketchup and tabasco sufficed. we ordered the sage fried chicken of course but next time i could do without. the white meat portions tasted bland and dry to me. the fries were delicious though and the SNICKERBAR flapjacks...what can i say? i love snickers! i don't have the biggest sweet tooth but this was pretty damn good. towards the end, when everyone was to capacity, i kept picking at the damn snicker morsels. so damn good. 

definitely good for kids and large groups. don't over order. you'll be sorry. :)"
3855,Hash House A Go Go,4,"There is nothing redeeming about this place....That in itself is its redemption

Hash House A Go Go is massive comfort(aka tasty, high calorie, butter, lard, sugar) restaurant inside the Imperial House on The Strip.  It is authentic with wood floors, basic tables, etc.  It emulates a roadside diner.  The wait staff is friendly and efficient.

The menu is light on health, low calorie options and rather heavy on burgers, fried foods and other breakfesty type of foods.  I had the house cured salmon, healthy enough, until you place it over two biscuits, add gravy over a bed of mashed potatos(loaded with cream, I am betting)....It did have two pieces of asparagas.

Healthy...no...damn good...Yes.  

My friend had a burger.  It said burger on the menu, but it actually was a big piece of cow with a ton o' spuds.  Big.  Unhealthy. Burger

Because neither of us had the USDA requirement of sugar, we split the $7.95 Banana and brown sugar pancake.  Pancake was the size of the platter, just plain tasty.  When I have my heart seizure, they will be pulling this meal out of my veins

Hash House A Go Go....The obesity epidemic may well have started here, but the food is plentiful, honest and delicious

I am currently fasting"
3856,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The wait here is crazy... because it's Hash House in a casino on the Strip, so duh!  You can get a drink to liven up your wait a bit, though. The bloody mary is actually very good. And large... like everything else here. 

The portions are huge and sickeningly so.  It wouldn't surprise me if they adopted a policy of wheeling food out in a wheelbarrow -- it would fit the theme perfectly!  Every plate I saw cleared around us was still half full, as the TV was playing a commercial to help starving African kids.  It felt pretty indecent to be throwing away all this food just for some 'Murican farmhouse gimmick. 

The flavors were good, but everything just kind of gave me indigestion.  The Benedicts come with a biscuit instead of an English muffin. Everything's just a little overboard.  The smoked salmon Benedict isn't with lox how you would expect it to be, but salmon with smoke flavoring. It was still pretty good, but wasn't what I thought I was ordering.

I think the gimmick wins over the actual experience.  When your food first appears in front of you, you're kind of star-struck and giddy.  But about 3 bites in, you realize you're just about done and there's no fridge in your hotel room."
3857,Hash House A Go Go,5,I really like their menu and decided to try the house specialty sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was delicious but the waffles which have slices of smoked bacon were a little too smoky for my taste. My friend loved it. I would order again but would prefer no bacon in the waffle. Staff was friendly and Place was clean
3858,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wait can be a little long, but they have an area open where you can pay for and enjoy one of their signature alcoholic beverages to make your wait more bearable. Food portions are huge (makes sense cuz prices are a little high too) but service is terrible! You have to pretty much keep an eye for your waiter/waitress to flag them down if you need anything. I needed butter and extra syrup, but by the time I found my waitress and she got it for me, it took so long that not only did my food get cold, but I lost my appetite. So make sure you tell you waitress or waiter everything you need (xtras and refills and all) when you order your food, otherwise, don't expect it til your check is brought to your table! I've eaten here twice, and both times I had the same experience. Now I've learned my lesson lol."
3859,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Got the roasted chicken scramble. Nice mix of fresh chicken, eggs, and cheese.  Slightly heavy with potatoes and a biscuit but the fresh strawberry jelly was awesome.  Nice staff and quick service even with a full house"
3860,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I went here for the first time with my boy friend. I didn't really know what to expect, but we had an amazing server!!! Rachael was Amazing, she made some awesome recommendations. The food was delicious and huge portions for a reasonable price!  If you're ever in the area and you happen to eat here, i would definitely recommend asking to sit in Rachael's section. Best customer service I've had in awhile!"
3861,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Come hungry food here are served in big portions.  We order the two popular dishes Sage Fried Chicken Waffles and the pork chop as recommended by our server.  He was very friendly and attentive. 
It's a weekday night the place was not very busy.  After our food arrived the sage chicken is crispy & flavorful which we really enjoy and 4 thick pieces of bacon waffles really fills you up .  The pork chop is well flavored but a little too done for me it could be a little more tender minus a star.  I love the sweet sauce that the pork chop came with it taste well together.  Overall I enjoy the place and will definitely come back and try their breakfast."
3862,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Almost blew past this upstairs  restaurant ,  as I wanted to quickly avoid a line on my hunt for this  hot spot .   At 10am there  wasn't many people  in line, but the  wait for  two  was going to be 45 min. I asked about the counter, and I timed it right, as there were a few  spots opening within 5 minutes! Score!  we enjoyed our team of wait/bar staff. Kai was a ROCKSTAR behind  the  bar .  Her hospitality  was awesome  and she helped us navigate  the  menu's many highlights .  She cranked  out dozens  of drinks before  us, all the while  interacting with staff and guests. What a pro! The food presentation  was great. Portions  were massive. Flavors  great  too. Having beat the line,  a front row seat at bar w/non stop action ,  and a full  belly... JACKPOT!!!"
3863,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Overrated!   The #5 avocado bacon burger was overcooked and dry.   Zero flavor!  I've had angus beef before and this burger was downright bad.   I was forced to ask for mustard/ketchup just so that it wouldn't be so dry.  Maybe I should have asked for mayo or thousand island.   They had a pork & eggs dish that I had a bite of.  The pork was bland and the potatoes were burnt.  I don't see the appeal of this place.  I did like the cucumber ranch salad,  but overall left disappointed.  The service was good, I will give them that.  We won't be back."
3864,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and even better service. We were quoted a 40 minute wait by the hostess staff but was referred to the bar for faster seating. Even though we sat at the bar, the service wasn't any different.. Thanks bar staff, keep up the good work!"
3865,Hash House A Go Go,5,Here at Hash House and our waiter is Travis. The best damn waiter on the planet! Boooooom!!!!
3866,Hash House A Go Go,5,Went here for brunch and had the Crab Cake Benedict. It was wonderful and the portion sizes are HUGE for what you pay. You could easily split the meal between two people and still have some left over! Definitely recommend stopping here on your Vegas trip.
3867,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Don't waste your time there! 30 minutes to get a table... Ok. When we finally got our table: suprise! Inside are so many empty tables!!! Why are we waiting outside exactely when there are 10+ free tables inside? 
Then our waitress arrives and tells us that they will be an average of 30 min wait to get our food from the moment we order ""because it is made from scratch"" ! Come on! Stop taking people for fools! We left!"
3868,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Service Wasn't As Good. We Went Around Noon And It Was Very Busy. The Menu Was Huge!! So Many Things To Choose From. Waffles Were Good. Overall A Great Place For Breakfast, Lunch And Dinner. Prices Are Cheap For The Amount Of Food You Get. I Will Recommend This To Other"
3869,Hash House A Go Go,4,30 minute wait was to be expected and easy to understand why people wait. All food were large portions but not breaking your wallet. I stayed safe with my chicken and bacon waffles. Will go again
3870,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Super long wait, but glad we stuck it out.  It was well worth it, and I then saw why it was such a popular place.  

Our waiter was super attentive, very on top of his game.  He was busy, but handled it very well.  While we were waiting for our orders to be taken, we looked around at the other tables...  There were a ton of good looking plates.  The menu is anything but ordinary, and plenty of unique options to explore.  Their smoked bacon was amazing, eggs cooked to perfection, the potatoes were flavorful and perfect (soft inside, crispy outside)...  The biscuit was big, fluffy, and moist...  And the side of gravy that the glutton inside of me ordered went perfectly with the biscuit, among other things on my plate.  

The portions here are rather large, so if you think you're hungry, remember you can always add on a side order half-way through your meal.  I ordered some extras up front and wasn't able to finish it all (or even close).  But I had a really good run at it, and wasn't disappointed with a single thing.

For how packed this place was, they have it down pretty well...  Our food didn't take long at all once we ordered, and everything came out exactly as ordered.  Definitely worth the wait, and worth me checking out next time to try something new on the menu."
3871,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The last time I was in Dallas, I wanted to try this place out but the wait for it was insane so we left. Glad I was finally able to try it out while I was vacationing in Las Vegas. The restaurant is inside of the LINQ hotel on second floor. We arrive at about 8:30AM and our wait time was about 45min. On our way house about about 10:30 the line was double from when we got there. That alone should tell you how awesome this place is!

Luckily we took a look at the menu while waiting because there was definitely alot of options too choose from.  Our server was nice and was attentive to us even when they were slam busy. All of our dishes were amazing! We order the banana foster french toast, chicken and waffle, fried green tomato, and corn beef hash. All were huge portions. The chicken was fried and season to perfection. It had a perfectly crisp batter. The waffle itself was a little dry and i think that was our only complaint. All the entrees were flavorful and I wish they would open a location in New Orleans! It was so hard to choose which one was my favorite because they were all that good."
3872,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Five stars for this one 
Nice cozy spot with huge family style portions, perfect for when u have been drinking all night or all day or all day and night and you are very hungry"
3873,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place. The portions, the service, and the atmosphere is just great. 
The portion: beyond generous. The average plate can typically feed two people. The appetizer can feed one person. If you are daring like me try to eat the main dish by yourself. This place serves breakfasts all day so that's a plus. I ordered the fried chicken benedict...bomb. The chicken is crispy. The eggs is fluffy. Mash potato is delicious. Bacon...chipotle sauce and cheese. Mmm mmm good
The service was excellent. Made my visit even better. Our waiter was very friendly and quick."
3874,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Five stars for the food and ambiance, two for the service.  A farm atmosphere is carried as the theme, and it is executed tastefully.  Server Ishii was cool and quick-paced in the beginning, but attitude improved as the meal progressed.  Portions are huge and high priced, including NO free coffee refills!  Waffle, pancake and four coffees were over $40, so be prepared to spend; a little expensive for breakfast, no?  Definitely a one time wonder!"
3875,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for a friends birthday. Accommodated our large group no problem, gave my friend a free birthday shot, got excellent service and dined on some out of sight Americana. Don't miss on the chicken and waffles, best I've had and probably ever will have in my life!"
3876,Hash House A Go Go,5,Found this place on yelp as/ usual. Food was awesome. Nice portions and just what I was looking for. Will definitely return when back in vegas. Great customer service as well which I love!
3877,Hash House A Go Go,3,"After a couple nights of drinking, we decided to treat ourselves to a good ole recovery brunch (that wasn't fast food) to help us survive our final day in Vegas.

Big, fulfilling portions and good service without ever having to leave the hotel. I got the salmon farmers' scramble with potatoes on the side, although I regret not ordering the side of mashed potatoes instead because those were so much better. Although it was really good, I was expecting something outstanding and wow-worthy because of the hype from other people. It tasted alright, but could be compared as similar to any other brunch restaurant that is of higher quality than Dennys' or ihop. The price is also similar to other brunch restaurants, so I wasn't too upset or disappointed.

Next time, I am set on ordering the lobster/fried chicken eggs Benedict because I stole a few bites from my friend (not like they were gonna finish that monster of a portion anyway) and it was delicious!!! Way better than what I ordered.

I will be sure to visit the one in my home town, San Diego, soon and write a new review."
3878,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Stopped in for breakfast, looking for a good Bloody Mary. We were not disappointed. Portions are huge. Bring friends to share. 
We hade safe fried chicken Benedict. Perfect blend of spice and of course balanced it out with a pancake. Yes only 1. They are HUGE!!!

Shout out to Victor C for great service!"
3879,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place seems like it's packed 24/7 since it's open 24/7. I have a platinum rewards card so we skipped the wait (which looked ridiculous) and were seated in less than 5 min. Even though that was speedy, it took about 45min for us to get our food after we ordered.

The taste of the food was good, which was probably the best part of the meal. It wasn't amazing but it was better than decent. We had the sage chicken and waffles, sage chicken benedict, and the smoked salmon scramble. The waffles were okay; I wish they had bacon bits throughout the whole thing instead of bigger pieces of bacon. The mashed potatoes that came with the Benedict were really good. The scramble was a little fishy but still good. 

I guess the portion sizes were reasonable/a really good deal for the price, but I feel like it would even be good if the prices were halves and the portions were halved. No one finished or even ate half of their meal, and I was eating with two pretty hungry guys who know how to eat. I feel like we wasted so much food because we took it to go and even though we ate some of it later, it wasn't as good and we didn't finish it. We all also felt really sleepy and tired after. I think it would be good hangover food but we weren't hung over lol

If you eat here, definitely share. One entree will feed 2, maybe 3 people. I have no idea how it would be possible for one person to finish one meal. 

I'm not sure if I would come here again. It wasn't a terrible experience but it wasn't the best either. I liked it more than I disliked it."
3880,Hash House A Go Go,5,Absolutely the best service and the best food. Never disappointed when I come here. We had 4 different plates of food and each one was incredible. Our waitress was fabulous! She was always 1 step ahead of us. Shout out to our wonderful waitress Sarah M!
3881,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My experience here wasn't the best experience one could of had , however, I did go later at night so maybe that had something to do with it. Anyways. I had ordered a bacon cheeseburger w/fries. It was mediocre. Sure they are ""large"" upon initial view. The burger twice the size of the bun, not too much filling however and the burger was very very thin. It was a to go order so we didn't bother checking our food thoroughly to make sure it was accurate, which unfortunately it was. We ordered our food well done only to return home and it be extremely pink. The fries were okay, but didn't have much flavor and definitely needed more seasoning. 
They do have a bar which is great. It's nice when you have to wait for food and can sit there while you wait. However, whomever was working the bar that evening did a terrible job on monitoring how much alcohol is too much and had 3 men leaving there stumbling over their feet, cussing like crazy and falling on their faces. I know it is Vegas, but safety first you would assume at a business such a this. 
Anyways, I hold none of that against them. And I am willing to try again. However, it wouldn't be to go and it would be during the day. Maybe that would make a huge difference."
3882,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband and I arrived for a late breakfast around 11 a.m. We were FAMISHED, and thought we would have to wait in line forever to be seated since the place was packed and there were people waiting everywhere. Surprisingly enough their turnaround was quick - less than 10 minutes - and we got seated right away. Service was quick & our server was very nice. I ordered the fried green tomato and chicken salad stack which OMG it's so good! The balsamic drizzle gave it the perfect touch! And my husband ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles which honestly, we could have shared since it was SO HUGE. It came with so many bacon-laced waffles (I lost count) and two large chicken breasts. Absolutely delish. Can't wait to go back!"
3883,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Every time I go to Vegas someone recommends Hash House and I go along with it cause everyone is always so excited and every time I am so disappointed.  They have huge portions, and that's about it.  A huge wait to be seated and then the foods is whatever after all that.  I tried their house bloody marry last time Wow wont do that again. overall next time I am going to share with my wife or one of the kids or just recommend somewhere else all together.
Gerry0625"
3884,Hash House A Go Go,2,The wait is unbelievable long and not worth it. Heard a lot of good things about it but it is over rated. Service was also slow. The only great thing about this place is the portion on some of the plates and its typically just the pancakes or waffles that are large portioned and not much else. The food is not bad but its just not worth the wait.
3885,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Normally I woul led give this place 5 stars but the wait staff tonight was horrible, I find it very hard to tip someone who makes you feel like you are an interruption to their business....Hello Helen you work for tips don't you....tonight you worked my table for free. No tip....sorry"
3886,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow. These plates are HUGE!!! 

I preferred the chicken and waffles, due to this sweet tooth talking! It was fantastic and I couldn't even finish everything. The watermelon drink washed it all down nicely and I had to wait a few minutes before we could get up and leave.

Service was superb and the restaurant was immaculate! Definitely cannot wait to go back!"
3887,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was inspired to visit by an episode of Man vs. Food.  That darn Adam!  Please be sure that you do not eat anything prior to going here.  THE FLAPJACKS ARE HUMONGOUS!!!!!!  The food is all delish and the juices are REAL JUICES.  Not that concentrated stuff.  I had the apple juice.  Looked odd but tasted great.  If you love fresh ingredients, you'll love this place.  Service is also awesome.  This place is a great break from the strip scene.

Updated 11/4/16
Back for another visit during a friend's bday weekend.  We decided to eat here at 2am.  I'm so happy that this place has only changed for the better!  The portions are still huge and the food is still delish.  Service was great as usual!  Thanks for being so awesome!"
3888,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Nice find in Vegas! No wait for our party of 5 but we were there before 10 am. Upon leaving the lines had formed. Atmosphere is nice and server friendly. 
Service is rather slow so don't go if you're in a hurry. Food is awesome! Presentation and taste are spot on. Chicken and waffles is a crowd favorite for a reason, and the burgers are awesome too! Will go back next trip."
3889,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions, and the food was pretty tasty. They lose a star though because there are almost no options for vegans or plant-based foodies. It's located inside the LINQ hotel, and they serve brunch with delicious French toast."
3890,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food and definitely huge portions. We didn't get the famous benedict or chicken and waffles but what we did order was tasty, huge and great value. We had a great server, Derek I think was his name sorry I forgot, who checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed even though it was a busy morning.

Btw, if you get scared off when you get to the top of the escalator by the crowds because the wait times might be too long, don't! We thought about leaving but decided to check the times and it was only 15 mins. We were seated quickly and once ordered the food came quick too. 

Our experience here was A++ and it will be on our must visit whenever we are in town."
3891,Hash House A Go Go,3,Meh. Huge servings of average quality American fare and horribly slow service. We would have had another round or two had our server ever bothered to return to our table to check on us after the 10 minutes to get our drink order in and the 20 minutes I took us to get the water we asked for three times. My wife's Long Island was good. My smoky moonshine Bloody Mary was average. I will only return if I am starving and there is no other decent option open.
3892,Hash House A Go Go,3,food was mediocre. nothing special. the bacon waffle was very sparse with the bacon.. had a foam like texture..and given to me barely luke  warm. I expected more  based on the positive reviews and was left disappointed
3893,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Super over sized portions!! Pictures does it no justice!  I am not sure if it's the big plates that makes the food looks normal size or what, but the food portions are huge!  I would suggest sharing a dish with someone if you are not a big eater.  There was a wait, but it did not take too long.  We had the following:

- Frigid Irishman - signature cold brewed coffee made with Jameson Caskmates Irish - strong, bitter notes, hints of Guinness, and creamy if you mix the whipped cream with it

- Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles - two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks - waffle was a little dry, the chicken was delicious, big portion, could not finish!

- Andy's Sage Fried Chicken - served with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit - delicious mash potatoes, the yolk from egg made the dish more rich, chicken was fried to perfection and the biscuits was buttery, try to get a little bit of everything in one bite!

Nice place to try if you never been, personally probably would not come back just because nothing really excites me but the over sized portions!"
3894,Hash House A Go Go,3,"There were a few things on my ""Vegas"" bucket list, and this was one of them.  I was so excited...so it may boil down to I had a HIGH expectation.  And truly, I vacillated between a 3 and 4*

1)  There is always and hour or more wait, and there are no light up thingies to let you know - so you either go and make the res, then gamble and come back - or you sit outside on your phone in the wait area.
2)  The food is touted on Man v. Food (the special I chose), New York Times, and ABC's Nightline - but I think everyone brings their A-game for those folks...know whatta I mean?
3)  It's pretty small - hence the wait.

I ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict style:  layered:  red skin mashed potatoes, a large split homemade biscuit, soft style scrambled eggs, bacon, a chicken fried chicken breast (Andy Sage style), fresh spinach, tomatoes, and topped with mozzarella (mine was burnt), and chipotle sauce.  What I learned is that you must cut through all the layers and attempt to form ""the perfect bite.""  The first few of these were 1) unsuccessful 2) extremely delicious.  At this point, it began to turn into a huge pile of chipotle sogged biscuit, through which you dig to find nuggets of chicken fried chicken, spinach, or bacon.  (My suggestion is to make a dish with those three and keep the chipotle on the side).  Within minutes of eating a little less than half, I was very ill.  Now, this could ONLY be the food, and not the 17 or so vodka tonics from the night before...or the bloody mary I had while waiting.  Be warned. 

My companions had various versions of: flank steak, chunk hash browns, various veggies, and biscuit - and it all looked really messy and unappealing.  One friend had the BBLT (just add bacon to bacon), which comes on HUGE Texas toast, and she added a medium fried egg on the side.  That looked really good.  The service was outstanding and the time at the table, and getting out was pleasant, unrushed, and memorable (there were 7 of us).

All in all, I'm so glad I had the experience, but I won't go through this kind of trouble for that kind of meal again."
3895,Hash House A Go Go,1,Worst restaurant ever. Ordered omelette with mushroom and the mushroom wasn't even cooked in the omelette. I asked where the mushrooms are and she brings in raw mushrooms. What the hell. We asked for sour cream and brings in 4 sour cream and didn't tell us that the sour cream were a dollar each without even telling us how much it would be. Food was dry and not hot at all. Can't believe we waited for 30 minutes for this. Worst restaurant on the strip.
3896,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Located at The Linq Hotel. 

This is a great place to come if you're extremely hungry! The dishes are HUGE!!! I don't think any of my friends finished everything on their plates. Great for SHARING!!!

Every time I come here. It's always during brunch hours. However, it's always the busiest time  and the lines do get quite long! The wait is usually around 45 minutes.

I HIGHLY suggest ANDY's SAGE FRIED CHICKEN BENEDICTS $18.99! It's so delicious! That dish was on Man Vs Food. FYI: I always ask for extra sauce! There's mashed potatoes, biscuits, eggs, fruits, and crispy fried chicken with their drizzling special sauce all over topped off with rosemary for decor.

We also ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It wasn't as good as the Andy's Sage Fried chicken. I wouldn't order it again. The crab cake had a sweet taste which I wasn't a found of.

Restrooms are located downstairs to the right of the escalators."
3897,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When my friends and I first arrived we waited about 45 minutes for a table (which we thought was ridiculous since the restaurant was half empty).  When we were seated, the hostess was rude to us when we asked if we could move to a nearby booth so we could watch the football game.
Considering it's Vegas, I honestly expected a small portions of food for the prices.  However when we got our food all of us were surprised by how large our meals were; all of us were only able to eat about half our orders and had to take the rest to go.  It was like we got 2 meals for the price of 1.  Our waitress and servers were extremely nice to us.  When we caught a mistake on our bill, the waitress had no problem correcting it.
Other than the unpleasant hostess, I would definitely recommend this place if you're wandering the strip and are very hungry  =)"
3898,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Pretty good, big portions  i had the chicken and waffles... different seasoning, but good."
3899,Hash House A Go Go,4,Awesome Food....been here twice now and loved it  both times....share with a friend if you you want to continue to party hard in Vegas.
3900,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First meal in Vegas before going out. Things to note before ordering:

1) Portions are large. Share, share, share.
2) The biscuits are BOMB, but filling.  Eat them knowing that you got a huge meal ahead of you.
3) There isn't anything wrong with leftovers, they are great food after a night of drinking.

Got the eggs, potatoes, and crab cakes. SO GOOD. SO FILLING. best leftovers ever. The asparagus that you get is refreshing too, since everything is ridiculously filing.

The service we got a really good too, She was super helpful and polite.

A great place to eat on the strip."
3901,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow great food.   Large portions I suggest you share a meal.   
The waitress was the best!
We did have a wait of about 20 minutes but well worth it."
3902,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions anf great mix drinks.  Would recommend the bloody marys and mule. Food was tasty and would definitely go back.  The only negative comment would be the wait (1.5 hour )and waiting area (small)
3903,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food, super large portions but best was our waitress, Deaneli....she was fun, spunky and attentive.    We came back the next day and got Deaneli again and she remembered our preferences.....highly recommend  hash house and ask for Deaneli! !!!!!!"
3904,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is delicious...great for breakfast! Didn't have for dinner but I'm sure it's great as well.. Huge portions!! We all got something different and it was great. Pancakes are huge. I got the chicken and waffles which were amazing! Go if your in vegas!!
3905,Hash House A Go Go,2,"First off, you should know that I am a waffle snob. Waffles are something of a tradition in my family, and I have VERY strong opinions about them. 

The husband got the famous fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was fine. The waffles were not. Heavy, doughy, flabby and lukewarm: these were very sad waffles indeed. Come to think of it, they were pretty much the opposite of a waffle in every respect. 

I was wary of the waffles to begin with and ordered the corned beef hash instead. The scrambled eggs that came with the dish were well prepared. The hash felt....um....assembled. I'm betting the dish was made by putting down a layer of fried potatoes in a skillet, throwing on some onions, peppers, and shredded corned beef, then piling on some swiss cheese and running the whole thing under a broiler. In no way were the ingredients sautÃ©ed together, which is what makes a hash a hash. This was just a pile. 

The server was friendly and attentive, if a bit unctuous."
3906,Hash House A Go Go,5,Oh my goodness the food was really good. I got the chicken and waffles that order was enough to feed two. The chicken was crispy and seasoned. The waffles were fluffy and yummy. Oh and the strawberry kiwi drink was great even the large piece of watermelon was sweet.  We won't talk about the wait but it was worth it.
3907,Hash House A Go Go,4,Bring your appetite. They did pretty well to accommodate the large crowd. We got Andy's Sage Chicken - it was huge but very flavorful. You have to give it a try if you are going. Quick service and lively atmosphere.
3908,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had been to the HHAGG on Sahara earlier in the year and loved it, so I decided to try out the HHAGG in the Imperial Palace casino. The wait was a little longer to sit down, but the food and service were just as good. I ordered the chorizo hash and my old man ordered the fried chicken benedict. Both were excellent and well worth the price. HHAGG will be a regular stop during my visits to Vegas."
3909,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge Portions, great selection of creative dishes and nice server staff. The food was good not amazing but solid and is more about quantity then the quality factor. I feel like the mashed potatoes are pushed into many dishes that dont make sense."
3910,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Service: Upon waiting for roughly 15 minutes for the server to take our drink order, we waited another 10 minutes to order our food, and it goes on...nonstop waiting for water, drinks, napkins, etc. Just horrible.

Food: I got the country fried steak like I heard about.  It was pretty good, it wasn't great, it wasn't amazing, but good...decent...

Ambiance: The interior decor looked cool from the entrance, but once you walk in, it started to feel like ihop or dennys, an average diner kind of feel."
3911,Hash House A Go Go,5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!! No matter what you get its a can't miss. Especially the chicken and waffles and the chicken eggs benedict. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. A must have when in Vegas
3912,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Okay so I went here a few years ago and ordered a pancake and a burger and although I barely was able to put a dent in them, I thought it was delicious. 

So I decided to take my friend here and I ordered the hash which the waitress told me would be a great choice.

I thought it was not very good, the potatoes were too big and tastes like frozen potatoes, and since that was the majority of what was in it I only give this place 3 stars out of 5."
3913,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Omg their food portion is huge, you can order one to share. The food was ok, American style, had to wait in a line, but the wait was not so bad"
3914,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge proportions and great tasting food, that came out fast and hot. We waited 30 minutes on a Sunday morning but it went by quickly because we went downstairs and gambled. Give your self plenty of time when coming here because the service can be kind of slow."
3915,Hash House A Go Go,4,"OMG! I had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict It was fantastic! My friends were similarly impressed with their meals.  I'm not a fan of the decor, but the food more than makes up for it."
3916,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The presentation is awesome and the portions are huge. However, the taste is just average. This restaurant was featured on both food and travel channels and rated high by Zagat so I guess I expected more. Well chalk it up for an experience."
3917,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Warning: Portions here are humongous! 

I ordered a Sage Fried Chicken Linguine to share with two other drunken people and that was way more than enough food for all three of us. The mushroom cream was ok. Wasn't too overwhelming but it wasn't the best either. There was a good amount of it which came in handy when we tasted the sage fried chicken. The sage fried chicken wasn't hot to temperature and it was also super duper dry. I only ate a few bites of it and I had to dip it in the sauce with my pasta to be able to enjoy. I did like the crispy green beans that were in the pasta. 

Our waiter was very difficult to find. Find to place the order, find to get a water refill, find to ask where the restroom is at, and to find to get the check. The place is pretty big but wasn't very crowded that night so I don't know how that works. (Bathrooms our outside by Fat Tuesdays)

What we thought would be a quick bite ended up being pretty long. Service is slow, food is ok. Decent place to go for diner food and large portions to share with a lot of people."
3918,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions and tasty!  Pancakes are the size of hubcaps and usually when its about quantity taste gets lost but not here.  Everything is big besides the scramble.  It was suprisingly small.  Service was great both times we went.  Once mid day and the other 2 am.  Late night it's not a full menu even tho it's open 24 hours.  Great coffee and bloody marys.
3919,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Definitely an experience!

Huge Southern Indiana style food taken to a new level. This place was highly recommended to us by friends so we checked it out, mostly for the chicken and waffles.

HUGE portions left us both a little too full. I would recommend splitting a dish here (and that is from a girl that knows how to eat). Don't plan to eat healthy here, if that is your plan go somewhere else.

You can order bloody Mary's while waiting to be seated. We ran downstairs and lost some money at O'Sheas wile waiting and popped back up. I do think they need a notification system for when your table is ready, especially since we were told 45 minutes and checked back early and were seated in 25.

What we ordered:

Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. I could have done without the cheese and mashed potatoes here. The sauce is not a typical hollandaise, more of a spicy southern dressing (still very good)

Chicken & Waffles. Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks. I have had better waffles, but these we're good and had bacon in them? So probably no complaining. Reduction sauce was delish, I wanted more syrup but my boyfriend was fine with it. The leeks were a great flavor in the dish, but not that ""Eater friendly"" to actual eat. The boyfriend choked a little and moved the rest to the side. He ordered and loved the house mimosa made with fresh squeezed tangerine.

I would have loved to try one of the many coffee drinks but knew It would be too much!

The sage fried chicken in both dishes was wonderful. Great texture and super flavorful.

The pork tenderloin, meatloaf, and bread pudding all looked amazing as well."
3920,Hash House A Go Go,4,We stopped by on our way out of town at the Imperial Palace location in the strip.  The food was quick and fresh.  Wife and I split the sage chicken with waffles and I threw in a 24oz bud in a bag in the order.  The chicken has great flavor and is moist. Waffles with the bacon cooked into them are awesome as well.  Great place and relatively reasonable if you split an entree. Unless your a big eater I suggest you share.
3921,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What a fun and unique spot for a late night breakfast!  There is a ton of construction on the Quad in this area, so it can be a little confusing to find this upstairs eatery, but well worth it!  Be aware that the portions are HUGE!  In hindsight, definitely would have shared.    They also have a full bar, which is always a nice touch.  Our waitress was the sweetest and very patient, with one very intoxicated person in our group  Clearly, not her first rodeo!

I ordered the Sage Chicken Eggs Benedict (as seen on Man Vs. Food), it was a BEAST and SO SO delicious...seriously the size of a loaf of bread filled with eggs, sauce, potatoes and crispy chicken- unbelievable!  The interesting twists they put on traditional breakfast items, is worth the trip alone.  Prizes were reasonable considering it's a touristy area!"
3922,Hash House A Go Go,4,"the wait to get in here is always around 45mins but it is well worth it !

Be prepared to come starving , and be full for the rest of the day.  Prices are reasonable and the food is outstanding. I have ate here twice and both times I must say were great.  It's almost impossible to finish your plate as they make Claim jumper look like a mcdonalds happy meal.... :)"
3923,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I heart Hash House A-Go-Go.

I went twice with my friends in my most recent trip to Vegas. As many reviews mention, each time there was a decent wait - but the food was worth it. Everything on the menu looks delicious, but don't be fooled into thinking you can get two breakfasts if you can't make up your mind. Even if you're a big guy like me, you'll have a hard time finishing the one thing you order. So decide if you want delicious flapjacks, delicious eggs, delicious chicken and waffles, or a delicious skillet. But no mixing and matching or you might die.

As some have mentioned, the location off the strip is a little better than the one in the Imperial Palace. It's got better themed decor and a shorter wait. As far as I could tell, though, the food is the same at both locations."
3924,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The first clue was watching half eaten plates taken away.  Don't eat there. The smoked salmon hash had no seasoning, the salmon tasted like it came out of a can, the cream cheese dollops did not make sense to the salmon, hash was basically fried potato nuggets, prefrozen,the dry biscuit with a rosemary twig stuck in it as a garnish was stupid. The other dish ordered was corn beef hash... Not much better"
3925,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is the bomb!!! Whenever we come to Vegas, we always look forward to coming here because of their chicken and waffles, which is amazing. There's bacon in the waffles!!

My friend tried their BLT bloody mary and loved it.

The entrees can definitely be split amongst 2 people or more. YOU WILL STILL BE FULL.

I came here on a Monday around lunchtime and it was STILL crowded, even though it was a weekday. My suggestion would be to put your name down, and roam the casino for 45 minutes while waiting. Also, they don't take same-day reservations but will take next-day reservations. Next time, I shall make next-day reservations to reduce waiting."
3926,Hash House A Go Go,4,Saw this on yelp and decided to check it out.   The food is great and the service from the staff was awesome!  You get a lot of food for the money.  The place does get busy and its loud.  But hey its in Las Vegas!
3927,Hash House A Go Go,1,Great food but bad service. Chose this place for my bday brunch. We waited over 40 mins for our order and the waiter didn't check in on us or apologize for the wait
3928,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ok i'd give this place a 5 but they forgot to ring our buzzer when they had a table ready..... But the sage fried chicken egss benedict was the bomb! Being hungover and weighing 230lbs I finished about 90% of it hahahaha. The chicken was cripsy they had just the right amount of their hollandaise sauce, the biscuits were light and fluffy. The only thing I would want more of is scrambled eggs. You definately need to come to this spot and grind on some killer munchies hahaha"
3929,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow this place was great
The portions were huge though I honestly think my husband and I could have shared the meal 
The meat loaf was sooo good"
3930,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place had such a large and delicious dish!! We got here at 11 and sat down around 145. So this place has a pretty long wait especially on weekends. The waitress Louisa was so sweet and helped us choose which dish to choose as we didn't know which to get with so many options. We ended up getting the eggs Benedict with mashed potatoes and fried chicken...at first we were hesitant because we wanted breakfast and thought chicken was a weird combo but wow it was so good!! Their food is in large portions so I highly recommend you share a dish! We shared and were full! We also had their fresh squeezed orange juice. Their food and service was great but the only problem is there is a long wait!
3931,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Worst food started throwing up after eating it. Fuck Derek Johnson the manager, guy is an asshole, he didn't nothing for me just said we're at a disagreement and wouldn't give me refund or do anything for me . Don't support a shady business like this"
3932,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food was delicious and not to mention the portions are HUGE! The prices are fair specially for the amount of food that your getting. Tried the snickers pancake and the chicken Benedict. Loved the Benedict's which 2 people can easily share. The pancake was delicious as well!
3933,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is awesome, the portions are ridiculously huge but that can never be a bad thing! It's a little tough to find since it's tucked inside the Linq hotel but just follow the overhead signs. Get there early because it gets busy! But it's a definite must try"
3934,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I STILL love this place! The flavors, the creativity, the home style cooking with fun twists.. its just so good! Not to mention some meals are bigger than your head! It's just plain awesome food and good value. We have been for breakfast and it was a super long wait but if you head in around late brunch time it's not so bad! I recommend anything with the Sage Fried Chicken because it's super juicy and crispy and you will never forget it! This time around the hubs got a Reuben which was piled high with meat and had thick, thick bread holding it all together. Their fries.. SO GOOD! I had the Blue Crab Cake Eggs Benedict which fully delivered in every way! Wow! Potatoes, thick country biscuit, Blue Crab, ugh! How can you not like that?"
3935,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I hope you're super hungry if you come here cause the portions; I kid you not are gi-normous!  I would recommend sharing a meal with someone or you will have leftovers for lunch/dinner/midnight snack/etc.  I normally order the Sage Fried Chicken which never lets me tummy down cause it's very moist and on point. I do add more syrup on my chicken cause the seasoning batter is a little bland for me. 

Today I ordered the Sage Fried chicken & waffles.  The waffle has bacon in the middle which is an amazing surprise with every bite. Unfortunately they do not have any hash browns. Wamp, wamp."
3936,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I got everything based on review from here.
The s'mores latte was ok, nothing to write home about. Just a massive display that makes it look cool, but as for taste... Eh.

Our server was ok as well, not super social, clearly busy. 

We got the sage fried chicken, and it was SO SPICY for me that I couldn't eat it. Disclaimer I think Spicer nacho Doritos are hot. 

As a bonus we got sat pretty quickly."
3937,Hash House A Go Go,5,"this food is so amazing. their ranch is the best thing youll ever eat. totally worth the $1.25 you have to pay for it, trust me."
3938,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yummy!! My boyfriend and I split the sage fried chicken and it was amazing! The portions are huge and the food is just delicious. My only complaint is that it took such a long time for our food to come out. It was worth the wait though! Also we were there with friends and so it was nice to have time to chat. Don't miss out!! There is one here closer to home and I will be visiting the local Hash House A Go Go very soon!
3939,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Outstanding food and service! I don't watch reality tv, but my boss told me to try this place. I was blown away by the special (as featured on Man V. Food - if that means anything to you). Delicious! The only thing better than the dish was the server. Tharon was an awesome waiter. I love attention to detail. And he provided that and then some! I'll be back soon to try some other dishes!"
3940,Hash House A Go Go,5,My husband and I had guests from out of town and we brought them here for breakfast. The food is simply amazing. I've been to there other locations too but the one inside the Linq casino tasted a lot better. The chorizo with eggs and potatoes are sooooooo good!! If you are staying at the Linq you must check out this place! Its super good. We had reservations but it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out. They were super busy so it wasn't an issue for us. The customer service was wonderful too. Make sure you come hungry because the portions are HUGE! =)
3941,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy moly!!! The portions here are HUGE! You will not leave hungry!!

Our table ordered the chicken n waffles, chicken pot pie, and a few other things which I can't remember. Everything was delicious!! The service was excellent as well. You could tell the staff knows how to take care of all types of clientele, which is very necessary for Vegas. 

I would definitely recommend trying this place, and will make a stop each time I visit Vegas!"
3942,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I won't let my bad meal deter me from giving this place a great rating.  There is always a long wait, but it is well worth it.  Never have I seen portions so large for a price so reasonable.  The servers there are so passionate about their job.  

I ordered a hamburger and the server suggested I live a little and try the meatloaf - long story short - my cut was sub par and that is being nice, however another person in our party ordered the same thing and it came out beautifully - albeit theirs came out 20 mins before mine.  But the presentation was still spot on.  When our server asked how I enjoyed it, I was honest - sadly I think he might have shed a tear - I kind of regret it - because really other than my dish the whole experience was excellent.  I'd definitely be willing to give it another go and would suggest it to anyone visiting Vegas!"
3943,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My new go-to food spot in Vegas! Love, love, LOVE the food and food choices, and the portions are HUMUNGOUS!!!"
3944,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The one at M, at the south end of the valley is great, this one is NOT.  Food- bad.  BLT Mary's - so so- not a good as the M.  Service- non-existent.  Seriously- I walked over a mile to get to this place because I like the one at the M.  Go to the M.  This was a nightmare."
3945,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After waking up around 10 with a massive hangover from a crazy Friday night... the hash house was the perfect cure. 

Yeah... the wait sucks, but theres also a casino downstairs... so time seemed to pass by pretty quick.

The Hash House has huge plates at really good prices and the presentation is very impressive, especially considering the price.

I'm a little more of a bitch than most when it comes to food because I have a pretty bad Gluten sensitivity (Celiac Disease) and most places are out of the question due to factors like cross-contamination and more simply menu selection. I was VERY suprised and stoked to see that the Hash House was aware of this and reassured me that it should be okay. I had no reactions to eating there and I was very happy with my Avocado Bacon Omlette!

Would recommend to others in the future."
3946,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The chicken and waffles were amazing. Worth the 45 min wait to be seated, it was a fight weekend and line was long. The food was definitely worth it"
3947,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing!! Only waited 10 minutes on a Thursday morning around 10am.  I had the man vs food chicken breast eggs Benedict and husband had roasted chicken hash.  Good price, awesome food, awesome service, and huge portions."
3948,Hash House A Go Go,3,"No wait at 8:30 on a Wednesday morning.  Large portions, if that's your thing, but the food was just OK, nothing special.  Server pretended to be attentive by promising to check back on us but took too long in between visits. Was multi-tasking too much and it wasn't even busy.  Overall, MEH."
3949,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Ugh, you are closed until 6am and I want some breakfast and now we are stuck eating sports grilled food -.- when you state you are 24/7"
3950,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was packed on a Wednesday night around 7pm. Thought it was surprising since it's mostly a breakfast/lunch spot. For years I had heard how amazing the original location in San Diego was so I was eager to try it and I certainly wasn't disappointed. 

A buddy and I shared the chicken and waffles and they were great. The fried chicken had excellent flavor and the waffles were cooked with bacon inside. However the dish that really stood out were the fried green tomatoes. These were absolutely delicious! Do yourself a major favor and order em. SOO GOOD!

the service was fast and friendly and the alcohol selection was more then adequate."
3951,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House a Go Go was in my hotel, The LINQ.  I had seen this place on TV some time ago, and wanted to give it a try.  I went for breakfast about 8am.  Good thing it was just me, so I could sit at the bar.  There was quite a line waiting to get in, and fortunately, there was one seat left at the bar.

I saw the size of the food by looking at others' plates. Huge!  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  It was no exception.  Four square waffles filled with bacon and two fried chicken breasts.  A massive garnish of rosemary and fried green onions.  Bourbon maple syrup on the side.

The chicken was perfectly fried, juicy and flavorful.  The crust was crisp and well binded to the meat.  The bones were removed except for the first joint of the wing bone.  Nice touch!

The waffles were a little dry and dense, but the bacon inside them made up for it.  As did a soak of the syrup.

The coffee was great and frequently refilled.  Service was pleasant and friendly.  I highly recommend this place and look forward to the next time!"
3952,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Don't waste your time or money eating here. The food was cold, tasteless and was as nasty as the manager was rude. My mother and I were going to split the sage fried chicken egg benedict, but were unable to eat it. My dad ordered the corn beef hash, which was served in a cold skillet, which we were later informed by the waitress that the skillet had to be cold or they couldn't carry it. In and Out Burger is way better!"
3953,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Last weekend I was in Vegas for an auction.   It was a whirlwind stay and I honestly didn't do or see very much.  I did get up a little early and had the desire to find myself the best breakfast, a breakfast away from all the commotion of the Strip.   So I asked Yelp for some guidance.  Typed in ""best breakfast""  Up popped Hash House A go-go. Nope in a Casino/Hotel on the strip.  Try again... typed in ""best eggs""  again Hash House, again I wouldn't accept that.  It happened over and over, no matter what breakfast item I search up would pop this same damn restaurant!  Eventually I relinquished and took it as a sign.    Glad that I did. 

As I was walking out of my own Hotel (Luxor) I passed the breakfast restaurant with three people inside.   It was early, 8:40am.   Nobody gets up at that time of the morning in Vegas so I was golden to get a good table, or so I thought.   

I parked and did the 13 minute walk through the Casino to find the restaurant.   Things were pretty quiet.  Found the little staircase that take you up to Hash House and OMG there were at least 125 people all waiting in line!!!!  Damn, I wasn't going to have time. I realized then I might be on to something special.  Fortunately I found the counter with an empty seat, felt pretty smug.   The guy next to me was there for hangover food, boy did he seem to need it.   

The menu is extensive and everything looked wonderful.  I decided to order the Hash, they have quite a selection I went with the meatloaf hash.    As I was waiting for my food the people sitting around me started getting theirs.  First the guy three seats over.  He had chicken n waffles.  It was piled a foot high!  No exaggeration,  a freakin foot high!    Next the drunkie next to me... a massive plate of pancakes with plantains on it, kind of looked like bananas foster.  His GF had the Chicken Benedict, crap it was as big as the chicken and waffles plate.   Looked delicious too.   

When my skillet arrived it wasn't your Denny's skillet.  I was more like a Paul Bunyan skillet.   I took a photo but really should have set a medium sized palm tree next it for scale.   The meatloaf was excellent and I think with a great deal of effort I was able to eat about half.    

I am glad that I went and would most certainly go again.   I heard they have one or two other locations in Vegas so I would probably try to find something off of the strip though."
3954,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I went here over the weekend. There was a wait for 40 mins but it actually only took 20. The server was nice when we told him it was our first time there. He explained the menu and recommended a few items. We ended up ordering the chicken and waffles and the man vs food item and salmon and eggs hash. The entrees were to big that there wasn't enough room on the table to eat. The food was quantity over quality but I would order the man vs food item again. Overall it was a good experience. One plate is enough to share between two people, maybe even three people depending on how hungry you are"
3955,Hash House A Go Go,5,Delicious!!! The chicken and waffles were huge and yummy. The French toast is my favorite. Will definitely make time in my next visit to eat at this place.
3956,Hash House A Go Go,5,We absolutely LOVE this place.  Kye and Sassy are great up at the bar.  Food is delish and plenty of it.  Spiked Watermellon/Lemonade is to die for.
3957,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I went there after a Saturday afternoon performance of Matsuri (A MUST-SEE!). It was around 5:20pm, and no more than 6~7 tables were in there. But we stood by the podium for at least 3~4 minutes before the hostess noticed us and got us seated.

Waited another 10 minutes for the server to come take order or give us water (we were about to leave by now). Got our orders in, waited 10 minutes for water, and 20 minutes more for our dishes (keep in mind they weren't busy. My server was only serving 2 tables including ours).

The Food was great. Large portions, nicely plated. The crab cakes were too salty on the outside, but with a little mashed potatoes it was fine.

Throughout the entire dining process our server did not come over to ask how things are, or got us any refills for the drinks. We left a 4% tip and was on our way. Next time I will try their other location to see if they're really famous for crappy service or was it just my bad luck.

Pros: GREAT food, very large portion and tasty.
Cons: TERRIBLE service, small menu. long waits for everything."
3958,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went into the Quad and they had A Has House A Go Go so I wnt in with a friend who already had eaten at one.  Wow what a cool place it was buzzing. I had their World Famous Griddled Meatloaf with Smoked Mozzarella and Roasted Red Peppers all on Fresh Amish Style Milk Bread. I also  had the Bacon mashed potatoes with melted cheese. 
Going back ASAP"
3959,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The sole reason we went here was because of the man vs. food coverage of the fried chicken waffle. It is tucked in the middle of the casino, but you see it clearly marked on the escalator going up.

The line was out the door even when it was only 11:30am. Wanting a quick brunch, we toiled around for 30min before been called. I was actually surprised that I did not see more people ordered the fried chicken waffle, but when ours arrived, people were asking to take pictures of our food. It was HUGE. Good thing we only ordered the fried chicken waffle between the two of us or we'd be lugging doggie bags with us for rest of the afternoon.

Great place to take people who haven't been."
3960,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is ah-mazing and you will NOT regret it!! I highly recommend splitting a meal with a friend, as the portions are HUGE. My Mom and I split the sage fried chicken and waffles and we BOTH got a chicken breast and two waffles. No one can eat an entire entree. The plates are the size of serving trays. I am not exaggerating. The food is fabulous. The sage fried chicken was a unique flavor. I really enjoyed how crunchy the batter was. The waffles had bacon in them. Who doesn't like that? Seriously it was a wonderful, flavorful, exciting meal. We were so full that we didn't eat again until dinner time. My fellow diners all enjoyed their meals except for the corned beef hash. I was told that was less then good but not terrible. 

The bloody mary's are incredible as well, served with a large piece of bacon, it's a meal on it's own. Go now, do not pass go. Eat here!"
3961,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you can get past the fact you're actually in the Imperial Palace, it is one of the true treasures of the Strip. Just think of having to man the escalators and stairs (which may or may not be contaminated with various infections) as being like a special ops soldier that has to navigate treacherous terrain to get to his target. Be of fixed mind and purpose, and know this is so worth it. 

Once you actually get there, the atmosphere and decor is great, and divorces itself from the rest of the property as soon as you get off the escalator. But you're there for the food. And if you're not starving, don't even bother. The portions are simply massive. Everything is so fresh, not to mention highly addictive. I've tried probably half the menu, and never gotten anything that wasn't wonderful. 

Chicken and waffles. Do it! It's cliche I know, but it is just delicious. I've also tried various things with pancakes and eggs that were between amazing and sublime. And of course it's Vegas, so they serve whatever kind of booze you'd like. Only had a regular sit-down dinner with friends here once, and we were pretty beaten up already, so not sure about the drinks. But you haven't lived until you've recovered from a hangover with pancakes and beer. For me this place was better than Excedrin and bottled water combined.

I actually got hooked on Hash House via their Hillcrest location in San Diego (where I learned the joy of full bar booze and breakfast). The line there on a Sunday could be an hour long, but it was so worth the wait. And I can't wait to get back to Vegas to try their new spot at the M.

The only thing about Hash House that I'm on the fence about is whether I want them to go national. I'd love to have one here in Florida, but I think it might lose some of its charm. And as places get bigger, sometimes they lose some of their quality. But I might be willing to roll the dice on a Florida franchise. I can guarantee them at least one customer on opening day."
3962,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First time I ate here def. 5 stars we got the corned hash and the chicken and waffles 

This last time we shared a meal as advised by our waitress. The French toast with egg and bacon was not enough to share. We ended up ordering side dishes that cost more than an individual meal would have cost. Some dishes are big enough to share not all as she stated. Will only come back for the chicken and waffles."
3963,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yes, there is a wait but the wait is worth it. The service is good and the food is on point. The portions is ridiculous. So, if you are on a diet... AVOID at ALL COST!!! Come to think of it, SKIP THE DIET!!!

The ANDY SAGE FRIED CHICKEN is TASTY and FILLING!!! Have this and you are good till dinner. Their stuffed burgers are good and the pancakes are huge. So come hungry. 

Definitely will go again."
3964,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went to the Hash House a Go Go during our last trip to Vegas, so when we went this year, we had to revisit. We ended up revisiting 3 out of 4 days for breakfast during this trip!
For one, our service was excellent every time we were there. The wait staff moves like clockwork through the restaurant, they are fast, efficient, and energetic. They must have great management because everything was very organized. 
I thought it was a lot to pay for breakfast, but it was a heck of a lot better than a $20 buffet. The food was fresh and you got more than enough food for one person to eat. 
And the food... oh my. The french toast and apple cinnamon pancakes were more like dessert than breakfast. I had the ham, spinach, and bacon scramble with grilled mashed potatoes and an enormous biscuit that were all delicious, especially the peach preserves that came with the biscuit. 
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone for an excellent breakfast in a city that is more geared to the night life, rather than those of us who get up early and like a good breakfast. I didn't go there for lunch or dinner, but I think we went there enough in a 4 day stay!"
3965,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is one of the must visit places for me every time I am in town. The Hand Hammered Pork Sandwiches is a must! The pork tenderloin is Huge~ It's as big as a pizza box! It stays crispy even for take-out. The first time I order Sage fried chicken and waffle, I just couldn't stop laughing when the dish arrived. It can feed a family of 4! okay, at least for my family of 4. Recently, I decide to be a little healthier, so I ordered the Fried Chicken Salad. It's the perfect salad for me, who knew the sourness of the green Apple, sweet caramelized pecans and blue Cheese mixed with mango vinaigrette can be so good!"
3966,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food was absolutely delicious, huge portions!! We could have shared a meal. Service was great and fast. Definitely recommend it!"
3967,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Was looking to grab a bite before I had to leave Vegas. I was staying at The Linq so decided to check out Hash House. I was single so opted to sit at the counter. I was greeted twice by friendly staff. It didn't seem to busy, so my order was taken right away. I ordered the BBBLT. if you like bacon (obviously I do) you will love this. The portion was huge! I couldn't finish it all. My only complaint is the bread/toast was super greasy. Combined with the bacon was a little too much. But all in all, it was delicious and service was wonderful. I wouldn't recommend it if you have a small appetite. Portions are very generous!"
3968,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was very good and different!  Had the Sage Chicken and my wife had the Lemon Pepper Chicken. Our daughter had a pancake meal.

The portions were large.  This fact doesn't overshadow the quality of the food.  Quantity is "" icing on the cake"". 

The service was good.  The food also came out pretty quick.  I would go again!"
3969,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Wait: Forever! It was super crowded, then once we were seated we had to wait even longer for our server to get to us. Since, for some reason, on a busy Saturday they had decided to have the poor, overworked bartender also serve about 10 tables. Annoying.

Food: Uh.. Yes, I'm a fatty, but asking to have your eggs scrambled soft does not mean ""please bring me out a GIANT bowl of over cooked eggs, because I've sent back two sets of eggs that were also incredibly over cooked."" I don't want more shitty eggs, I want my two eggs cooked properly. Or at the very least, not the exact opposite of how I like them. I'm not that picky.
  
If you don't know what scrambled soft means, don't give us the option to ask how we want our eggs. Just tell me, ""the only scrambled eggs we have are premade and sitting under a heat lamp getting nice and bouncy!"" Then I can change my order. Simple."
3970,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Finally got to try the Food Network renowned Hash House A Go Go.

We got here at around 8-ish on a Saturday morning; and the wait was already about 30mins.

It's like... ""c'mon people...aren't you all supposed to be dead tired on your beds from partying last night?"" --No.. not the case.. apparently.. there are a lot of breakfast enthusiasts that actually do come on breakfast time (They do serve their menu all day...24/7 okay)...

Cory and I got seated on a little booth by the bar on the left. Even my tall husband said the table was too high. Let's just say it wasn't too ergonomic for eating.
Our server's name was: Sassy..... She got our drink orders and Cory and I already knew what our orders were even before being seated.. so we gave that to Sassy too....

What i like about Hash house is that... It doesn't have a cellphone network coverage for AT&T!!! And it didn't seem like they had wi-fi either.

So pretty much all my check-ins and foodie Instagram photos had to wait....
But I liked how Cory and I got to spend the whole breakfast date...Phone less... How liberating. I was a bit on edge.. but it was awesome. We played with straw wrappers; we checked each other's noses for boogers... we made faces at each other. Yes.. lots of things you can do while waiting for your order.

Anyway...

My gigantic SAGE CHICKEN AND BACON WAFFLES walked over to the table (like seriously, it covered Sassy's head while she was walking towards our table).... and man was it seriously massive. My jaw dropped and I instantly gained 5 lbs after it was placed on our table.
Let's just say that It was a different taste of Chicken and a different taste of Waffle.
The chicken is deep fried and breaded but with a hint of herb. It lingered in aroma that at one point; i thought i was eating a grilled chicken breast. Ha! Not.
The Bacon Waffle completely took me over the edge.They weren't little bits of bacon okay. There were huge pieces of bacon embedded in that waffle. 
The plate came with two JUMBO pieces of chicken; and 4 jumbo pieces of waffle. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.

Cory got the SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT.... Oh dear lord.. that hollandaise that covered the whole plate? it looked like it was whisked into butter submission goodness perfection.
Rich.Good.. Yummy.. Fried Chicken yummy.. give it to me. I personally liked his better than mine. 
And once again.. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.

Highly Recommend to those seeking comfort food that can compensate bad hangovers.

I gave this 3 stars because I wasn't sure if i liked the taste of the food itself; or if i was just overwhelmed with their extraordinary way of plating. I mean.. my two chickens were atop each other on a stack of waffles secured with a huge steak knife.
I'd have to give this another shot again and try simpler items on the menu to break down their food artistry and concentrate on their flavors.

Both our orders plus a little banana Latte was close to $50.00++. So... it could get pricey for two people.."
3971,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was a great place to eat! I had the meatloaf sandwich and it was amazing! I've never had a meatloaf sandwich before and this was yummy!!! The service was great, the wait was not to long, but worth it, and it was delicious!

 A must go when in Vegas!!"
3972,Hash House A Go Go,4,The portions here are HUGE! so you won't leave hungry. Prices are on par for LV so expect it to be more than you thought it would be. The biscuits are especially good. I had the chicken and waffles which they're famous for and it's an eye opener when you see it. A huge pyramid of chicken and waffles with a knife stuck in the middle. There's not a whole lot of flavor and I've had better but it's still not bad. I mean there's bacon cooked inside the waffles. Overall I wouldn't mind coming here again.
3973,Hash House A Go Go,4,Always good food the kids pancake is insanely big!!!I had the roasted chicken scramble and I really enjoyed it.
3974,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Saw this place featured on Man V. Food and tried it out the first morning we were in Vegas. Not only did I love this place, but so did my wife and daughter. 

I had the chorizo house hash, my daughter had the biscuits and gravy, and the wife ordered the corned beef house hash. Everything was great, and the price was very reasonable for a place on the Strip. A really great alternative to the buffets. The eggs were cooked as ordered and the portions were very big. 

Next time, I'm getting the chicken and waffles although the chorizo was really good and very spicy. My wife always gets a corned beef breakfast and she really enjoyed the one available here!"
3975,Hash House A Go Go,3,"These are the biggest portions of food I've ever seen in my life.  I saw an episode of Man vs Food and while I was in Vegas, I figured this was a great spot to go to. 

The wait wasn't too bad, around 15 minutes or so.
I believe I got the truck driver sepcial.  They gave me one of the biggest pancakes ever.  I only ate a little more than half of the pancake and I was already out of it.  The sausages were quite good and the scrambled eggs were soft.

I would give this place 5 stars, but the food is only spectacular because of the portions.  I honestly would get a take home box, but I don't want to hold that stuff around Vegas.

I'll try to the sage fried chicken from Man vs Food next time.  My friend got it and he said it was awesome.  Maybe it might change my rating."
3976,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food, big portions, decently priced. Definitely worth the visit, would come here again!"
3977,Hash House A Go Go,4,"we went to hash house a go go after my sister saw a commercial during our vegas stay last week...i was pretty much like every other commenter - hungover, hungry for real food and trying to not to lose any of it as a result of being hungover...but this here joint? Damn Good! it is now my new favorite place to moan after a long vegas night.  i decided the bacon scramble was the way to go and she went with the sage chicken/smashed potatoes/cheese eggs platter. the wait is annoying, the yelling so early (and with my senses heightened) wasn't what i was going for, but siddling up to a breakfast bar, and enjoying a drink while i waited for my food was just what the doctor (and my sister) ordered. and the bar staff worked harder in the hour i sat there watching them than most people do all day - amazing creations, fab food.
can't wait to go back!"
3978,Hash House A Go Go,4,"There us much variety  here..the food is fair ... just a bit overrated to me ... one thing that annoyed ...was these stupid sticks they put in your food ...like burnt spaghetti. .. really stupid,and not very creative  in my book but more of an annoyance. ..i had the chocolate pudding cake last time and it was out of this world good ...but yeah... Like i said the sticks in your food ...not very creative and or fancy ... if i wanted sticks in my food id go out side and pick them fresh out  the tree my self lofl  :/

... i will give it to them though the portions are well ;)"
3979,Hash House A Go Go,2,"My visit was on a Monday night, after 10 pm.  Upon being seated, took 8 minutes to be greeted and asked for drinks. Water was all that I was interested in and it was never refilled for the entirety of my visit. The infamous sage-fried chicken salad was my choice for the night, and it simply reinforced  why I don't order salads at most restaurants. For $14, I was not only unimpressed but pretty let down considering it was a go-to item on the menu. To note: salads are huge at this place; but that is to be expected when the salad is solely composed of chopped iceberg, CHEAP. The remainder of toppings included grape tomatoes, blue cheese, and pecans. For a serving bowl-sized salad, 4 grape tomatoes is hardly noticeable and the pecans were so chopped that they were unrecognizable. The crumbled blue cheese was an adequate amount. Now to the chicken. Sage is a strong herb so it should be identifiable fairly easily, it was not. The chicken, in fact, had no taste and was clearly made MUCH earlier in the day then left to sit, so that there was a weird gummy layer in between the skin and meat. This was surely old chicken that was thrown under the broiler to heat up. With all of this, a weirdly tangy dressing is served, actually tossed in the salad, and good thing I opted for it on the side instead because its mildly inedible. There were only 3 other options for salad dressing, STRANGE, but the cucumber ranch wasn't too bad. The worst part of this effortless salad entree were the numerous cores of lettuce I found. I picked 3 while eating it and i was only able to eat half the salad, so not sure if there were more. One core of iceberg head is 1 too many, and 3 is just careless.  I tried washing down this mess with water but i had to do it conservatively because the server never returned after i asked for a different salad dressing. In fact, when she did return much later, it was to give us the check, when we hadn't requested it, and no dessert was offered. With this prime location in the strip, everything i mentioned needs major attention and improvement. I won't return."
3980,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I absolutely love the food here. It's such big portions and so delicious and definitely worth the price. Even their drinks are amazing with their souvenir cups as well. This was the second time I've been to a hash house a go go (first time in Orlando, Florida) and I brought my boyfriend to show him how amazing the food was. But I gave this location 2 stars because the service was absolutely horrible. The waiter was very attentive to other tables but not to ours and throughout the night we realized why: he was extremely pleasant with bigger parties (meaning bigger tips) than he was with our small party of two. He didn't put any effort into simple conversation when he greeted us, didn't offer any suggestions and didn't even bring us any complimentary biscuits to start our meal. It was very disappointing because I spoke so highly of the restaurant and knew they were better than the awful service we received. Maybe one day we'll give it another try but for now, I wouldn't bother spending so much money here for such an unforgiving experience."
3981,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict Signature dish....was not very tasty or good. The gravy sauce they had with this dish is tangy and doesn't go well with the fried chicken and eggs. It's a big dish that I shared with my wife. She didn't  think it was good either. She gives it a 2 star too. We tried to get a little  traditional gravy sauce to go with the fried chicken which would be 10x better in my opinion.....but they said it is going to cost an additional $4.50. Wished they jusy gave customers the option which would be great. I declined getting the traditional gravy and just finished my meal. It's was $18.99. If u don't t like tangy and bit spicy, this dish is not for you. For a popular signature dish, big disappointment by 2 people."
3982,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Vegas. A city to gamble, eat, walk around, drink, and eat again. 

In one of our eating periods, we decided to go to Hash House A Go Go. Now be warned, unless you go the moment this place opens, you are going to wait for a table, possibly for a while. Luckily, they have AMAZING Bloody Marys, mimosas, and various other breakfast beverages while you wait and chat with the other hungry brunchers. I would strongly suggest the Tangerine Mimosa and the BLT Bloody Mary. Trust me. 

Another thing I would suggest is to listen for your name when the hostess calls you instead of laughing hysterically at the bar about nothing in particular or you will miss your table...but the good thing is, if this happens to you, they are pretty nice and will fit you in pretty quickly. 

When you get to the table, there's only one thing you need to worry about ordering. And it's big enough for like 3 people. THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Oh my dear lord. It's like a whole chicken on top of an enormous waffle with some sweet, sticky syrup and its finger licking good. The chicken is so juicy and a perfect complement to the crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside waffle. This is one of those meals and experiences that I'm still thinking about because it was that good. I was so busy enjoying every bite that I didn't even take a picture of it...

You'll just have to take my word for it and try it yourself next time you head to Sin City :)"
3983,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great breakfast spot!!! Went with a few girls and everyone loved what they ordered.    I tried the Chicken & Waffles at the suggestion of our cab driver, concierge and hostess.... it was great!!!!  Apple Juice was freshly squeezed and divine. I will definitely return on my next visit.  Oh and our waiter was most helpful with the menu.  Try it!"
3984,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Portions are way to big and I had a dead fruit fly on my food, ill never visit again ill make sure I tell all my friends and family. Overpriced for poor food"
3985,Hash House A Go Go,2,Wow what an amazingly horrendous line they had this past Saturday and Sunday !  As a consumer please note there are other establishments within a stones throw from this particular location that provide great food at very affordable prices without waiting in line.  Why have an escalator if it doesn't work ?
3986,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Disappointed by the chicken and waffles. After reading some of these reviews, I believe the only time to eat it is when you're inebriated or hungover. 

Firstly, the chicken was luke-warm and dry like it were sitting out for a while. The waffles were much too doughy! (And here's a tip for the bacon; use bits, not strips if you're placing it inside the waffle.) The maple reduction didn't taste like maple, but some sort of teriyaki-based Asian sauce. Like I'm all for Asian-fusion, but this dish was a disaster. I choked back tears it was so bad. The only thing on point quite frankly was the fried leeks and the only saving grace of our dinner was the Arnold Palmer. I drank it like I was dying of thirst.

Maybe I am being a little bit dramatic, but it's only a little. Order the chicken and waffles at your own discretion. They should rip down that giant poster, burn it, and replace it with the rib-eye."
3987,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food was amazing. Portion size is huge so it's shareable. Friendly service but very busy place. Got the chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict to share. Also a side of the red velvet waffles. Flavor was great. We were stuffed fast and had to take the rest to go. We also tried their Bloody Mary which was great. Their mocha was so cute and yummy. Loved it
3988,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good place for breakfast. The hash is piled onto country-style potatoes, served with two eggs, choice of sausage or bacon, fresh squeezed OJ, cold brew coffee, or their signature Bloody Mary with pork?! Service is good, tables turnover fairly rapidly."
3989,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for breakfast after drinking too much the day and night before. I needed something to refuel my body and give me energy. It was kind of hard to find this place because It's pretty hidden all the way in the back of the Quad Hotel.

So for breakfast I got the Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs on a biscuit   with mash potatoes. Even though you look and read it in your mind or out loud and sounds soooo delicious, it was just pleasant. It didn't wow me or had me like OMG but it definitely filled me up. 

Presentation  was awesome! It was a tower of awesomeness that I thought I could devour. The chicken wasn't bad because it was crispy on the outside and white meat in the inside. I wish the bacon was more crispy though instead of soggy because of the cream. The biscuit was huge and dense that I wan't really feeling it especially with the mash potatoes right under it. Mad carbs! The chipotle cream was really good as it had a little spice to it but wasn't overpowering. It was too much carbs though. Oh wait I said that.  It did cure my hangover but I don't think I would get this again although I am down to try other things on the menu. 

Other people at my table had the French Toast, Salmon, and the Chorizo on an iron skillet which all looked so good. 

Prices aren't bad either for everything. It got crowded around 11-2pm so go early if you want breakfast."
3990,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food was pretty good, the portion sizes are HUGE, HUGE, HUGE!!. I would share with a few people instead of everyone getting there own plate. Also, try to score a seat at the bar to avoid the long wait for a table. I (-) two stars because the food took FOREVER to come out and the drinks were blah."
3991,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is one of those places that is more about presentation of giant portions of food than necessarily good food.  The mac and cheese is super basic and not worth it outside of happy hour.  The candied bacon is very good, though.  Definitely a good idea to share a plate.  You get a lot of food for a lot of price when I think it would be nice if it was less food for less price.  Oh well, that's their shtick."
3992,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The server who sat is down copped a major attitude when we asked for a booth, rather than being crammed into a little table practically right on top of other people. The server hard no personality and couldn't answer questions about the menu. Three biscuits in our meal were hard and dry. I had a goat cheese and sundried tomato scramble. It tasted horrible! There were more potatoes then I knew what to do with. They filled up the whole plate. Potatoes were overcooked.  Ketchup didn't even help. Banana latte tasted like an average latte. Mitt worth three 7.99. Won't be coming back again"
3993,Hash House A Go Go,3,"DELICIOUS! Everything we have tried is is amazing. Best Blood Mary's ever. The sage chicken is delicious! The portions are huge so, come hungry. Very clean restaurant and bathroom, friendly and helpful staff. We've been to both locations and I have to say Henderson is are favorable."
3994,Hash House A Go Go,5,We Came in for breakfast my husband had the pancake breakfast and  I had the egg white scramble ....both delicious!!! Great portion sizes enough for two people! Fast and friendly service.
3995,Hash House A Go Go,1,Horrible enough said and they have the nerve to sale chicken and waffles. If I was the food police they would be banded from making horrible chicken and waffles
3996,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is my FAVORITE spot for breakfast! The food is so fresh. I always order the eggs Benedict. Best I've ever had. Very fresh with the perfect flavor combinations
3997,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had a really good experience here. The service and the food were both great.

There was no wait, we were seated immediately.. We went around 8pm and it wasn't even close to full at all. We got our drinks so fast & the food even faster!

I found this place by Yelping, not from the show. I've always wanted to try the chicken & waffles phenomenon! 

Let me tell you something.. the boyfriend & I could not finish the one plate of chicken & waffles. I honestly don't understand who can? I felt sick after eating it and there was still 2 waffles left on the plate! Sick in a 'full' way of course :)

The warm spinach salad was great too.

I love this place and next time I'm in Vegas, I will be back.. to try something different. However, chicken & waffles? Great combo."
3998,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is the kind of place that makes Americans fat and next day drunks happy. Huge sized portions of everything that could possibly make your heart stop. Its menu is southern influenced and truly an experience with how everything looks. The pancakes are the size of trash can lids and the chicken and waffles look like a caloric tower of goodness. Ive been wanting to try this place and I'm glad that I did but I don't think I will make this a regular stop on every trip to Vegas.

Be prepared to wait in line and get the standard generic service due to the number of people being served, but that's standard when trying to eat on the strip."
3999,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Two stars for the food and 45 minute wait, one star added because they held our table while we gathered a couple late comers in our party, and then minus that star when I remember they wouldn't seat us because we were missing a couple people in our large party. We couldn't even sit and have some drinks. We had to stand around in the overcrowded waiting area. And then when we are seated in the back room find that they have several open tables while more poor suckers wait in the waiting room. 
I got the corned beef hash. Dry and bland. You could literally beat someone to death with the hard ass biscuit that came with my meal. My wife ordered a dish vegetarian, which they screwed up and put meat in. She had to wait to get her food until almost everyone was done eating. They didn't even comp her orange juice, which they also manages to screw up. 
Also, those monstrous flapjacks... hideously dry. 
This place is just such a disappointment. 
Last gripe, what is up with the twigs sticking out of every freaking dish. Seriously, look at the photos. Yeah, I know they are sprigs of rosemary. They do nothing to improve the lack of flavor in these dishes nor do they improve the looks."
4000,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First let me say that the service was amazing!! I don't have a negative thing to say about our waiter! Now for the food...If you are looking for healthy eating this is not the place for you! With that said the food is ridiculously delicious and the portions are huge! I strongly suggest sharing meals if you are not used to eating large portions. Their watermelon margarita was delicious! A must have for sure! Another must have is the chicken and waffles! So good!! I can't say about the dessert as I was too full to have any, guess I need to come back to try it."
4001,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Never been here till I visted Vegas, but heard they have one here in my home town San Diego, California. 

The atmosphere is pretty loud, music is awesome, service was alright not bad, in all honesty I just think our waitress had an off day, but the manager was quite polite and fixed all of our problems. Apparently the food there is all fresh and cooked from scratch, so you do wait a while for your food. HUGE PORTIONS and when I say huge...I mean HUGE. My pancake was bigger then my plate...the waffles are on steroids! Overall, the food was delicious and I'd definitely go back."
4002,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is my third time here in past three year. I have to say the quality has changed. I had ribs and egg benedict. The flavor of the ribs has changed from traditional american flavor to teriyaki, which is really good in its own way. But the portion definitely has decreased since last year. 

The most disappointing part is the egg benedict. It used to be one of my all time favorite, perfect flavoring, great portion size, and awesome juicy chicken. However, this time the mash potato was unevenly seasoned and the egg was scrambled instead of poached. Those are tolerable. But the fried chicken was so dry and tough that I can barely stick my fork in it. 

I really want to like everything, but the much-too-dry fried chicken ruined the experience for me. I hope it will just be an one time thing."
4003,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had a really fun time coming here for a friend's bachelorette party (breakfast the next morning...hungover's cure? carbs)!

Love the fried chicken, comes with a sprig of rosemary in the middle, lol.  Big portions, more of a wait when you go to the one on the Strip.

Still fun and consistent flavors."
4004,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are HUGE the chicken and waffles where great... I wouldn't say amazing but great and huge. The chicken Benedict with the chipotle sauce was un-inspiring, HUGE but just ok. The banana carmel pancake might have been the best pancake I have ever had and brought my rating up one star."
4005,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Last on my stop for the Vegas trip is ""Hash House A Go Go"". Once again, great reviews and location brought me to stop by for my last meal. And by first look at the pictures, I'm sure I will not be disappointed. 

Called ahead to make reservations. Unfortunately on Saturday and Sunday mornings/early afternoons they do not take reservations (no surprise there). Showed up around 11, waited about 20 mins or so and was able to snag a seat at their bar area, which is about 10 chairs. The wait for a table was 1-1 1/2 hours so I thought I would take my chances and ""vulture"".

To drink, I got a coffee (which actually was a step above most diner coffees) and the have me some watermelon lemonade drink on the house for waiting. I ordered the chicken and waffles to eat. The place is bumping, but the staff is moving real fast. Getting people in and out as quick as possible. That's what I like to see. 

About 20-25 mins until I got my food. Not bad for a busy Saturday morning/afternoon. The portions are huge. And the food was awesome. And wait... Is that... BACON IN MY WAFFLES?! Such wow. Such awesome. I will be back."
4006,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was a definite must try while we were visiting Vegas. My BF and I came here for Sunday brunch and the place was packed! We did have a thirty minute wait, however it id absolutely worth it. They turn tables fast and it is very apparent they have a well trained management team and staff. Service was friendly and fast and the delicious food (both flavor and portion) is hands down worth the food coma. I am actually happy that I do not have a HHGG in DC, otherwise I would probably be as fat as I am tall (lol). We had the House Bloody Mary and the Mimosa which did not disappoint. For the entrees we had the Texas Ranchero Benedict and the enormous pancake. Neither one of us were even close to finishing our meal. Honestly I wish we would have had a refrigerator in our room so we could have leftovers. Last but definitely not least, the prices are very affordable (rare for Vegas). Will definitely hit this place up again when I am back in town :)."
4007,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy cow!!! They don't serve your food on a plate, they serve it on a big platter!! So much food that if you're not a big eater, I suggest sharing a plate.

My husband and I came here with the family and we both got different dishes to share. I ordered the granola waffles with eggs and a side of sausage. At first granola waffles didn't seem to appetizing but I wanted to try something other than the regular vanilla waffles. Every single bite of that granola waffle was yummy!! Every bite tasted fresh and not frozen. 

My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and that tasted fresh as well. The chicken was juicy, nicely seasoned, and did not taste greasy at all! 

This is a hot spot for tourists so if you're coming here I suggest you come early! We went around 11am and the waiting area was crazy! They are also remodeling the hotel so can you imagine we were like a herd of cattle waiting for our party to be called. I think for our party of 7 we waited between 30-45 minutes, but so worth it. Per our waiter, Lawrence- he said the best time to come is on Wednesdays. 

If you have kids, don't bring the strollers if you don't have to. Although the dining area is big, they ask that you leave your stroller behind the hostess area, which is pretty small.

For the amount of food you get, the price is totally worth every bite! Consider me a fan and next time I'm in town we're definitely eating here again!!"
4008,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Overpriced tourist food for the most part.. Highish prices and mounds of mediocre in-quality food.  Lots of potato and biscuit with the hash order.  Minimal meat, minimal veggie, tough meat, the chef didn't know how to properly poach an egg.  So go fried or scrambled I'd say. The service was okay and polite but really it's a waste of too much food you'll turn away (who wants left overs in Vegas?) unless you split a big plate with multiple people.  Theatrics, not refined food.  These places keep feeding the hog houses so they can put pork back on the table for your dinner order."
4009,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are just ridiculous! Seriously ridiculous. My sister and I shared a plate of the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and I don't see any other way to conquer that plate.  It comes with two large fried chickens (not chicken pieces, but a whole chicken) and 4 waffles.  All for $15, this was the best deal that we had in Vegas.

Our concierge at the Bellagio recommended this place.  She called it the strip's hidden little secret, but it's not a secret because in the middle of the day, the wait time was 30-45 minutes.

The hostesses were very impersonable and really had an air about them as if we were bothering them by wanting to be seat.  Luckily, our waiter made up for the rude hostesses.  He was attentive and on point with the drink refills; Always appreciated when the Vegas weather is 115 degress outside.

Please make this one of your stops when in Vegas.  From the decor, various celebrities have endorsed and multiple food/cooking shows have featured this restaurant."
4010,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place is awesome. First time in Vegas and I've heads about this place and it was amazing. You want breakfast? COME HERE! PERIOD!!!!
4011,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. 

One of me. 

I tackled it in two meals: a very very hearty dinner and a delicious breakfast the next day. Felt the heartburn kick in halfway through the meal. The fried chicken is very crisp, mashed potatoes very rich, and the biscuit soft and buttery.

Best post-meal idea is to walk around the Strip from one end to another and again to ease the food coma."
4012,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Oh my God, the portion sizes are huge!!

Some girlfriends and I came here for a late breakfast after a late night out on the Strip. It was about 11:30 when he showed up and we waited about 20 minutes. It doesn't matter when you come--you will have to wait at least 20 minutes.

I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. I know this is supposed to be 'the thing' to get here, but I'll honestly say I was not that impressed. There was far too much sage and even with bacon baked right into the waffles, they didn't have much flavor. My friends ordered the sausage gravy pot pie, which I like a lot more.

The service was okay. This place is always busy, so the wait staff is constantly go-go-going (hence the name of the place, perhaps?). It's hard to navigate through the place without being bumped in to by a waiter or waitress in a hurry. All in all though, they do an okay job."
4013,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is a little piece of heaven to me. Breakfast is my favorite meal, so much that so that just ""a little"" breakfast doesn't do it for me. I'm used to bacon/eggs/toast/grits with a side of bacon, maybe it's my grandma's southern blood in me. When the waitress explained the menu here to us, she pointed out a particular section and said something along the lines of ""be careful, this is a lot of food."" I had already selected something else not from said section, so natuarlly my thought became, ""Uh oh... I must not have ordered enough..."" Boy was I wrong. What Hash House must categroize as ""not a lot of food"" is enough to feed a small country.  

It's like getting two meals at once. I can be a pretty big eater and this breakfast had me satisified until dinner time. 

Not only are the portions substantial, but the food is good too. This is not slop - it's well put together dishes with tasty sides and a lot of flavor. The fried chicken and waffles is their signature dish, but i decided to go ""lighter"" with the fried chicken and mashed potatoes and i was not dissappointed.

This is a great spot and i definitely recommend. Try going early (pre 8 AM) if you want to avoid the breakfast crowd on the weekends."
4014,Hash House A Go Go,5,It you like tasty gigantic portions at a fair price hash house is it the place for you. First of they prepare everything from scratch so it takes awhile to get it. But when your food comes to your table you can help but to drop your jaw and take a picture. I orders the snickers pancake (yes I said snickers) and the chicken & waffles tour.  The waffles had bacon fused into them give you the sweet & salty taste that's amazing  the snickers pancake was as large as a pizza. It was large and thick and tasted so good it makes you wanna slap your mamma !!!! Def wanna go back
4015,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One word:  INCREDIBLE.  This place was packed for breakfast but after being told we'd have a 20 minute wait, we were seated in 5 minutes. I ordered the scramble while my husband ordered the sage fried chicken & waffles. Both were tasty with proportions that would've easily fed 4. The maple infusion that went over the chicken was perfectly sweet to balance out the saltiness of the crispy fried chicken. And I mustn't forget the super buttery biscuit  served with homemade strawberry jam. To. Die. For. Overall, a great experience. Staff was friendly & quick."
4016,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Reserved a table for 8, and waited 45 min. When we were all there, we were told it would be another 15 min. Ordered the cold brew, which was surprisingly great for a crazy southern food place. Ordered the sage chicken and waffles which was definitely a meal for two. MASSIVE amount of food! Surprised by the bone in the chicken, but tasty and less dry when you add the syrup. Crab cake Benedict was hearty. The sauce has a really nice kick to it, which I loved. Tomato didn't do much to balance the saltiness. Service was friendly and quick for the amount of food. Waters were refilled often. Restaurant was very crowded, but doesn't feel crowded when you're sitting down."
4017,Hash House A Go Go,2,"No feeling it. One of limited restaurant choices at the Quad Hotel. It was obnoxiously loud.
Music is way to loud and constant clanking of dishes. Service is ok, food is okay, I've had better. Had wait too long for a seat
And to pay bill."
4018,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Really good chicken and waffles...preferred to original hash. Really good side salad too. Our party of four had a really long wait that only increased as the day went on as we noticed upon our exit and really slow table service. However, Rick, our server, was very nice and seemed to do what he could to provide what we needed once he realized we were getting antsy. We did expect a little of this as we chose to eat at a popular dining establishment on the strip but every aspect from water to check was long winded. Super tasty but I'm not sure I'd endure it again."
4019,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG. OMG. OMG!

First of all, I freaking love love love love love breakfast/brunch food. It is the best. 

So uh obviously, I was head over heels about this place. Simply. Amazing. A tad overwhelmed by the ridiculous portion, but every bite and every urge wanting to pass out was soooo worth it. I don't know why I never came here on all my previous trips to Vegas! Geez. 

Thank you, Kye, for taking care of my mom and I! Your Brown Sugar Banana flapjack suggestion was an absolute homerun - very glad that you recommended it! You know how much I loved it? I had it two days in a row! Their apple juice is also very good.

(Gets very crowded and busy very quickly. I recommend coming in no later than 9am to get seated as soon as possible.)"
4020,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Before I give the review, I must give you a warning....bring your appetite!

Came here for dinner on New years Eve to grab a bite with my partner. We got seated right away and ordered our drinks. Once the beverages came, our waiter told us the specials and we asked for his suggestion. He told us that the sage chicken and waffles was a favorite. We ordered that and the bbblt.

He brought us hot biscuits to start and they are huge and the most delicious I have ever had. They are soaked in a sugary butter sauce that is amazing.

The food came and it was massive. My blt had so much bacon and lettuce that you had to cut it to be able to eat it. I chose the fries as my side and was glad I did. They are amazing and so crispy with seasoning.

My partner loved the chicken and waffles. The waffles actually have bacon in the middle of them and the chicken was crispy and delicious with just a hint of sage.

Our waiter was so nice and joking with us like we were old friends. Very nice touch.

The space is really large and laid out well. They even have photos of celebrities that have eaten there.

This place is a must try ."
4021,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The show Man v. Food recommended this place as a must go in Vegas! It was my first stop. It was hard to find as they failed to mention it is located in the Imperial Palace Hotel.

My husband had chocolate chip pancakes and I was the largest pancake you could ever imagine! But it was so delicious with the best buttery-chocolatey taste!

I had the Benedict eggs hash. I was not pleased. The eggs made me throw up. I don't know if something was old and expired, but I didn't digest it. Oh well, life goes on.

Pros:
- The most humongous portions you can ever imagine
-Great Prices
- Nice staff
Cons:
- Too much on the menu
- Menu is not as precise as it should be
- The waiting time on an empty day, is unacceptable
- Location is not convenient as it feels like a maze just to get there

I won't be returning there. Just not a good experience for me!"
4022,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One of the few things I actually recognize in the new LINQ Hotel and Casino are the double escalators near the back of the main casino floor which now take you straight up to Hash House.

My friend from Florida had never heard of this place (He doesn't get to Orlando much to hit the one on I-Drive) and was really hungry, so I knew we could not go wrong here.

The mistake my good friend made was ordering the Chicken and Waffles plate and not offering to split it with me, as he boldly bragged about being hungry enough to consume anything put in front of him.

Despite warnings from myself, the server and anyone else who knows better, he forced me to order my own plate which I happily did as a veteran of their awesome meatloaf sandwich and mashed potatoes.

Shortly before my friend's plate arrived, he saw another Chicken and Waffles entree walk by on its way to a table in the next room and he looked at me and said, ""Ok. I'm in trouble.""

He gave it a heck of an effort, but the battle was clearly over before it was ever fought. However, he enjoyed the signature item as much as I always have on my visits and I'll never let him hear the end of this. (Although he still smiles when he thinks of how bacon is INSIDE the waffles)

In the true spirit of Hash House, we washed down as much of our entrees as we could handle with a brown bagged 25 ounce can of the King of Beers and even walked out with those in hand after we paid our server, who did a really good job throughout our visit despite being really busy.

So, if you're a first-timer, please listen to your friends who take you here. Find something scrumptious on the menu that you can share and take that route. You'll have plenty to eat and STILL probably be asked if you want a box to take the rest home or back to your hotel room."
4023,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I wish I could give this place a better rating but I just felt so much anxiety eating breakfast. They shoved WAY too many people into this restaurant. Barely any space to walk or breathe or have a decent conversation. The music was blasting so loud I didn't want to talk because it was exhausting to have to yell and scream at 10am when I'm just trying to get some breakfast in. I mean I know it's Vegas but still.

They also don't have a restroom inside, you have to walk back downstairs to the casino to even wash your hands :(

The service was forgettable. Nothing special but not terrible. 

Enough negativity though, the food was still great and my pancake was about double the size of my face! Tasted great, everything tasted awesome. You're definitely getting what you paid for! That's for sure! Which is why I wish I could give them a better rating but I'm just not happy with the environment! If you're okay with craziness that early in the morning, you'll fit in just fine!"
4024,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is located on the second floor of the Linq. The menu has a lot but it's also limited, a contradiction I know. The food took forever to come out and the service was seriously lacking. Took forever to bring syrup or butter or a straw. The portion sizes of the food is HUGE. That's what gets your attention. The taste was good, not spectacular. Tried it and wouldn't be pressed to come back."
4025,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We were in Vegas for five days in July of 2014, and unfortunately only stumbled upon Hash House on our last breakfast. 
We got there between 8 and 9 am, and were seated right away with a party of 3. If you have a larger party, or if you come after 9, be prepared to wait. When we left, there were plenty of people waiting, but the restaurant is huge so I don't think the wait was long. 
The menu is small enough to not overwhelm you, but big enough to where it is hard to decide on just one thing. I had been craving a BBBBLT, so that is what I had. It was GIGANTIC! Tons of bacon (hence the more than one B) on thick toasted white bread. It was perfection. Served with fries that were just ok, but the sandwich filled me up plenty. They don't have heat lamps in their kitchen, so the food came out right when it was ready. This could mean that your whole table won't get their food at the same time, so throw manners out the window and eat while your food is hot!
The portions are HUGE and the prices are way more reasonable than anything nearby for the quality of food. Plus, if you are a Total Rewards cardholder, you get a tiny bit of a discount! I would suggest visiting Hash House a Go Go more than once on your trip not only to enjoy some delicious food, but also to save you money in the long run and fill you up for the better part of the day! I can't wait to go back."
4026,Hash House A Go Go,4,So I came to Vegas for a bachelor party hungry and a little drunk I thought that this place would be cool since they had a After Hours diner feel  Beer took 20 minutes. Tall can in a bag. Creative but for 10 min but after I got annoyed.  we have approximately 30 minutes to get our bill and I was not the only issue food was delicious get service with Support as a former Yelp reviewers I feel like I should warn not only one but prevent people from having to wait tomorrow for their bill even my friend Robert and he needs that the bills was way too long when Alan hastily to come to our table and others.. Shoot you do get service with the part I go for more Yelp review Verizon like I should warn not he won't have anything to wait for their bill even my friend Robert please that the bills was way too long and not in Haslett if I'm to our table my friends kicks dinner really motion or say anything but that's basically what kicks us I also this week it's even part of the court which was not part of the meal he 35 pics of metal and he was not paid which means is restaurant City good little one more sorry
4027,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our first visit there recommended by James brodfuehrer 
Great service and great food 
Huge portions be sure to visit this place on an empty tummy 
So worth it"
4028,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I arrived around 9am and waited about 5 minutes to be seated (I didn't want to sit at the counter). The staff was kind but not overly available. My intention was to order the chicken & waffles but changed my mind at the last minute. Instead I ordered the banana french toast.  It was very tasty but I could only eat 1/3 of it. Partially because I was full but I also got tired of the flavor. My eggs were overcooked. I really liked the tangerine juice, but again the small size would have been sufficient due to flavor overload. If I could have eaten it all it would have been a good value. I will go again but will pay the $2.50 to share a dish with a friend."
4029,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is amazing. Great customer service,  the food portions are big. You cant go wrong with this restaurant,  i recommend  this restaurant to  everyone. I got the sage chicken and it was delicious."
4030,Hash House A Go Go,4,Long waits but they serve tons of food. And the food is good. Chicken waffles will feed you plus another person.
4031,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have always been a  fan of Hash House A Go Go since I visited this chain restaurant in San Diego.  The food is consistently good, the portions are huge and playfully displayed. They offer great breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner items. Some of my  favourite menu items  include the roasted pork tenderloin house hash, fried chicken and waffles, chicken pot pie and meatloaf sandwich. The only nits are slow service and the tables and booths are not as clean as they should be."
4032,Hash House A Go Go,4,Good food.  HUGE portions.  Great service.  Interesting morning place to eat.
4033,Hash House A Go Go,1,Waited over an hour when they told us it was a 40 min wait tops. Then we requested a booth and they said we take a table or we have to wait longer. THEN.... I don't get my food when my husband's meal was brought out. Over hyped and  terrible service. Much better breakfast places where we live in CA.
4034,Hash House A Go Go,4,"the food was good and the portions large but a little expensive. but it's an experience so i would recommend it at least once. the caesar salad was like high teens or so, the mushroom burger was $15 or so, and the eggs benedict was like $26. 

the service was friendly and the place was huge so it can cater to any group."
4035,Hash House A Go Go,5,First time in Vegas and had to try hash house since it was highly recommended by a complete stranger on the plane ride here.. Pancakes like all other comments are extremely huge but delicious.. fluffy and crispy edges.. eggs were not as good maybe cooked with other foods because they tasted different.. bacon crispy.. our server was very friendly and kept checking on us.. I will definitely recommend this place
4036,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love hash house!!!!!!!!!! Amazing food ginormous portions and great prices!
4037,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Sat down at this place for a late late/early early breakfast after drinking and gambling all night! Portions are huge and all of our meals were great! The breakfast scramble with bacon and avocado was delish and the fried mashed potatoes are a delicious alternative to country hashbrowns. Mocha cheesecake with caramel drizzle was just the right sweet. Side note - one complainer in our group wasn't happy he got end pieces of toast with his breakfast...not something I would ever be worried about but he sure was, so if you care, specify you don't want the ends!"
4038,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place has huge portions, seriously, share. I had the Sage fried chicken and waffles. They were great, although the fried leeks were a strange flavor addition. Blood Mary's were perfect and very spicy. The prices are great. 
Why would they get two stars then? 
Our waiter, Ricky, on 12/28/14 was high as a kite it seemed. I'm not sure what was wrong with the guy, but kept thinking he had made a mistake and then would come back and ask if he did it right. His eyes were glazed over and his speech was slurred. He introduced himself four or five times. 
He got worried about splitting our bill three ways. 
He had no idea that he had already brought our food properly. 
Get it together, Ricky."
4039,Hash House A Go Go,5,"5/5 Service
5/5 food

Tl;dr Big portions (great for sharing and posting on social media), great tasting food, but expect  long wait times during common eating hours.

Service: Staff is friendly and there was no issues to report.

Food:
Salads 5/5: huge portions, and tasted fresh (no complaints) 

Country fried steak 3.5/5: on their menu they have it labeled as a chicken fried steak, I'm curious to know why they haven't fixed it yet. Steak had a lot of batter, but it tasted great and there was absurd amount of side dish portions. 

Sage fried chicken and waffles 5/5: hands down the best chicken and waffles combo I have ever had. Portion amount is absurd and there's bacon within the waffles. The fried chicken is moist and the crust is flavorful. The cooked leek also adds a great dimension of flavor as well. 

There are multiple locations throughout Vegas, but just keep in mind that the one within the linq is open 24/7 but the one at the Rio is only open for breakfast - lunch hours."
4040,Hash House A Go Go,4,The wait staff were great. They all helped each other out. The food portions were gigantic. Not terribly hungry ordered the grill cheese and just ate 1/4. Ate all the fries. Took the remainder home ( great reheated ). My dad brought his appetite and demolished an entire mushroom double burger and fries. It was very noisy with the music cranked up and a bridal shower. We came at 6pm and had no trouble getting a table.
4041,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I fell in love with this place in San Diego so getting the chance to go back was a no-brainer. Although the dÃ©cor isn't nearly as nice as the San Diego location, the food is equally amazing. A native Hoosier, the pork tenderloin sandwich tends to be elusive outside of Indiana so when I find one the rest of the menu becomes irrelevant. Clara (""show me the beef"" fame) would be excited to see that the meat significantly dwarfs the bun. In fact it is the sized of a normal dinner plate. On top of that was the side dish of mashed potatoes covered in strips of bacon and smothered in cheese -- had to have been at least a pound. I hear their breakfast is equally as good. I took three college athletes who all amazingly scarfed down their meals with no problem. Another bonus was the price. While Vegas is known for price gouging, the prices here are normal for 3x the amount of food."
4042,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is amazing, and there's no way you can leave here still hungry because the portions are HUGE! The only downside is it gets pretty crowded, so expect a wait."
4043,Hash House A Go Go,2,"So not worth it. If you want a fancier version of Denny's- this is it! If you also want to feel like crap afterwards, this is also it! Food did taste flavorful- the spicy chicken grilled sandwich is probably the best thing on the menu and most humane in size as well. A bit dry but flavorful and good. The cheese and egg quesadilla was also good... but why it's in a bed of mashed potatoes/carbs is beyond me! The crab cake Benedict was a let down. The spicy sauce on it was awesome but it was just extremely heavy and carb loaded - just not worth it. Good to try if u have run out of all other options but yeah."
4044,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Must visit for breakfast!   Put it on your list!   Obscene portions, this food is begging for your selfie.   We saw several orders of chicken and waffles, I'd try that next time.   Had the chorizo hash.   I pigged out and still only ate about a third of it.   
Hash house Bloody Mary, spicy, good tomato flavor, nice veg on top!   We went at 8am on a Friday and only waited about 5 mins, when we left at 9 the wait area was full!  I'm guessing an hour wait!"
4045,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait was 10 minutes on a Sunday! Not bad. The food was good, service was great! I ordered a side of gravy for my biscuits...I wish I didn't...it wasn't that great actually. Their jam is amazing!! Order the jam instead of gravy!!"
4046,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was our 2nd time going to this chain, 1st time @mohegun Sun casino, 2nd time here in Vegas. The food was phenomenal and unique. The highlight of our visit however, was Lou, our waitress. She was so friendly, knowledgeable and down to earth. It was probably our best dining experience here in Vegas. Thanks  Lou!!!! We will be asking for you on our next trip here. Keep smiling!"
4047,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'd give it the exact 3.5 stars it has currently for almost no good reason: the waiter service is attentive and satisfactory---the food portions are gargantuan and generous---the interior is comfortable enough and has fun decoration.
The only issue is that picking a restaurant in Vegas gets you stuck in a vicinity for a long time unless you cab it. At Hash House, you're stuck at the Imperial Palace.
Food was good but not memorable."
4048,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best breakfast in Las Vegas. Was recommended by a friend and thought me and my girlfriend would check it out.  Was not disappointed, the portions are huge and the service is great! You get quality and quantity. You will not be disappointed with Hash House a Go Go,  the brown sugar banana pancakes are AMAZING!"
4049,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Tried to go here for breakfast, was told to split the party up, then told it would still take an hour. Of course what they really meant was, it's going to take at least one hour if half of the people waiting got up and left. Honestly it isn't worth even a 30 minute wait for Hash House. It's good and you really get good value for what you pay but with all the great dining options on and off the strip in a place like Vegas, I can care less for 15 dollar pancakes or french toast just because you drizzle cinnamon on it and bring it out in portions big enough to serve 2. I'd say skip it and go to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris for the better Vegas Experience. Enjoy Crepes and Mimosas outdoor overlooking the Bellagio Fountains rather then a dark room in the corner of a beaten down casino. Sure the tab is going to be like 15-20% higher, but did you seriously go all the way down to Vegas to eat at a better version of IHOP?"
4050,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A family style breakfast place. The food portion is huge but tasty. We tried 
1. house smoke salmon egg Benedict - amazing yummy!
2. waffle combo with eggs and sausage. Waffle is crispy. good!
3. pancake combo with hash. Pancake itself is really thick. 
Huge portion, good for a group people."
4051,Hash House A Go Go,3,"There's a few locations for Hash House but we opted for the one in IP as it was closest to our hotel.  

The wait for our party of 6 was pretty short maybe 15-20 min.  We were seated and I decided to share the chicken and waffles. We placed our orders and this is where it goes down hill for me.  We waited probably about an hour for our food.  Now being that you're hungover and starving this does not make for a good combo.  

When all the food finally arrives the portions are larger than life.  We go from starving to grossly full and disgusting.  The food was tasty but the wait was not worth it! We had to walk back to our hotel after our meal and then we all took a two hour nap.  

Food was ok, service was good, wait for food is ridic!"
4052,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was a little disappointed with Hash House A Go Go. I have visited the Tractor Room in San Diego and loved it (their other restaurant with the same menu) and read all the positive reviews on Yelp for Hash House, so I was expecting it to blow me away. It didn't, but it wasn't bad either. William was an EXCELLENT server, extremely friendly, helpful and a great attitude. I'd recommend him to all patrons. 

I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the chicken was rather bland. They need to add some spices to the seasoning. Or how about just add any kind of seasoning at all? The waffles had bacon cooked inside of it which I wasn't expecting. I would have preferred normal waffles and bacon on the side. I found it strange the waffles didn't come with butter and I had to request it. I know, I made my chicken and waffles dish even healthier with the butter. I did enjoy the coffee and my mother's blueberry and pecan pancake was very good. Next time in Vegas I'll skip this place and try somewhere else. 

Tip: You can make a reservation if it isn't Saturday. It's a good idea to do so since they get very busy."
4053,Hash House A Go Go,1,"My family and I were there on Tuesday (December 30, 2014) and just wanted to let you know that the food was excellent and Yvette was an amazing server. We were a party of 12 and do understand that it might be difficult to accommodate at times. The hostess (I think her name is Dylan -- long blonde hair) was not the most pleasant. For someone who works the hostess desk, her attitude and demeanor are not the best first impression of your establishment. Sad to say, she was just plain rude. We understand that she can't sit our party right away until everyone got there, but she could have informed us that in a polite manner.  I work in healthcare and deal with people as well. From my experience, one unpleasant interaction impacts an individual's overall perception of that experience. I just want to say that it might be a good idea for Dylan to go through a customer service class to better her interactions with your clients. Thank you so much."
4054,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Dear Hash House A Go Go, please come to NY. If you're looking for a good deal for brunch, look no further. You may need to wait 20 min to be seated, but I promise it is worth it! Also be prepared to share food. The portions are huge but great to save and eat later (which is what we did, so good the second time too). We ordered a sweet and savory dish along with a cold brew coffee. Everything paired so nicely together. If you're unsure of what to order, ask the wait staff- they make great recommendations! Definitely come hungry!"
4055,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Checked this place out on the last day I was there in Vegas, its right inside the Quad hotel. You have go through the hotel take the escalators to get to the top and bam your there. Now I want to gripe a little bit about the arrangement of taking in guests. The first thing you see is a line to your left at a counter, thats where you put your name down right? WRONG thats where you can order a drink. 

I was so disappointed that I waited about an additional ten minutes than I needed to in a line I did not need to wait in. I saw a line that was getting larger at the counter I assumed this is where you put your name down but it wasn't it was just to order drinks if you wanted any during the wait. You have to pass up this counter to go to the front of the restaurant to put your name down. By the time I figured this out there were already about maybe ten or twenty names ahead of me so I had to wait a little bit longer. FIX THIS GUYS this was very frustrating for me and a few luckily for some guests I saved them by pointing them to the front, thank God I was there. 

Alright after about a twenty five minute wait I got myself a bloody mary just before getting called. The bloody Mary was beautiful with its  green olives and pickled chili and man oh man does it have a lot of pepper, you can almost not tolerate it at first but after yo suck down all the pepper that settled at the bottom, the drink gets easier to finish. 

Me and the wife got a booth and I have to say the industrial look was eeh dont really know how that connects to any theme but ok. There is like metal platform plates bolted everywhere and the tables are also covered in sheets of aluminum, very cold to rest your elbows on but ok lets get to the food. Me and my wife shared a chicken and waffles breakfast, trust me everything in this place is share-able because of the HUGE amount of food they heep onto your plate. 

The service was pretty good although because it was so busy here it was kind of hard to get the attention of our waiter. He eventually would come by and got us whatever we needed but you can't blame the guy the restaurant was at maximum capacity, I know he was trying to keep up as best as he could. 

When the chicken and waffles showed up it was a tower of fried chicken on top of bacon loaded waffles. It looked good but it didn't taste as good as it looked, the chicken and the waffles taste as if it was frozen bought and reheated. The only reason why anyone would forgive the taste is because you get so much food, seriously. My wife said it was good and then I asked her ok lets take away most of the food and give you one piece of chicken and one waffle would you still be happy and she said no and I asked why and she said because its not enough it doesnt taste that good that it can be on its own, and I said ah ha! see told you its really not that good. 

We also ordered extra biscuits with gravy which was also ok but it was gigantic enough to satisfy our questions for taste. Its really hard to say bad things about a restaurants in vegas because to be honest you have limited amount of choices, especially for breakfast. Would I come here again? well I dont know we'll see. The prices where not that bad to be honest. The only thing redeemable here was the bloody mary which again was just ok.

ps: also forgot to mention if you need to go to the restroom you need to go back downstairs to the hotels restrooms. They do not have any restrooms inside the restaurant, really sucks when you just need to wash your hands."
4056,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The staff was very friendly. Everyone I passed by would smile and say hello. I enjoyed the chicken and waffles with bacon! Huge plate that could feed 2 people. The chicken was crispy and juicy! My wife on the other hand just ""liked"" the pancakes. I tasted them and I thought they were good. She can be pretty picky."
4057,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions!  Had the fried chicken eggs benedict.  Eggs and fried chicken on top of biscuits, tomato and mashed potatoes with a chipotle cheese sauce covering.  It was so good!  Easily could have shared this, but I gave it a good effort and finished a bit over half.  Pancakes and waffles also looked great.  Make sure you go there very hungry!"
4058,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Food was great, service was great, until a roach came crawling out. And the manager said sorry there's nothing I can do .You have to dispute your charges with the pest control company  ...really???"
4059,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Go early! We were seated right away, but as we were leaving a very long line had formed! 

I ordered the French toast, hubby had corned beef hash, and lil one had a kid's pancake. 

Like others have mentioned, the portions are HUGE! My French toast was delicious. I really enjoyed the thick slices of bread, bananas, and nut crumble. Hubby seemed to enjoy his hash, the biscuits looked good. The kid's portion pancake was very large too.The fancy espresso options looked very indulgent, but I just went with a regular Mocha. It was just okay for the price, mostly tasted like cheap chocolate syrup. I would probably skip it for just a regular cup of Joe. Prices are pretty typical for Vegas, service was good. 

Solid breakfast joint, I would come again."
4060,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've wanted to try this place for the longest time. I didn't know it was a chain (founded in San Diego) until I was in Chicago and saw they had a Hash House there too. It's located at the Quad, formerly the Imperial Palace, and soon to be renamed the Linq. It was late at night, so when we arrived there was no wait. They are open 24/7.

I had the sage fried chicken (2 breasts) which sat atop 4 bacon waffles, with hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. The chicken breasts were crispy and juicy. The waffles were fluffy and had strips of bacon within the batter. Large portions- each entrÃ©e can easily feed 2. 

*Featured on Man v. Food"
4061,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was absolutely amazing, and I loved all my food. Although it was a bit loud, it didn't take away from the food. My waffle was very fluffy and not as heavy as usual american breakfast food. I also had a side of fruit which was very refreshing. Definitely recommend!"
4062,Hash House A Go Go,4,Took my boyfriend here for his Birthday after I read all the great reviews. No one lied! This place is delicious! We were piggies and went twice in one day! If you are a bacon lover you MUST get the BBBLT (bacon bacon bacon lettuce tomato)! Delicious!  If you are in vegas this place is a must!!!
4063,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We've visited this location many times in the past and never had an issue until our recent visit about a week ago. They took so long to seat us and they weren't even busy. Hostess said it'll be about a 10 min wait turned into 30 almost 40 minutes later. Meanwhile we noticed they continue to seat other guests who arrived after us. I had to get loud with her at one point when she told us for the second time they are clearing up a table for us when I can see plenty of empty tables. Thank goodness the food and portions made up for it, as usual! I gave them three stars for that. I'll visit again just hopefully the hostess does her job right."
4064,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This was a happening place for a Wednesday morning. Everything on the menu made my mouth water. I ended up with the red velvet waffle meal, and my husband the French toast meal. The French toast was great, my waffle was disappointing. The texture was like they'd just used Betty Crocker cake batter. The eggs and ham and bacon were mediocre, and although my husband did ok, my stomach immediately rejected breakfast as soon as I made it down the escalator. It ruined the rest of the day and made me regret every bite."
4065,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is so awesome. Andy's Sage chicken - represented in man vs food was amazing. The Bloody Mary's are the best I have ever had - spiced to perfection. Brie our server was a wealth of information above and beyond the restaurant and food selection. She was virtual tour guide for Vegas. She needs to start a blog.
4066,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Greeting- yes
Vibe- someones basement
Prices- good
Bathroom - downstairs in casino pass/ fail
Service- good
Biscuits were dry as a bone 
Crazy big portions. Sage chicken and waffles can feed two at $20
WIGB? Probably not
It's like the Cheesecake Factory on steroids but stuffy due to no windows"
4067,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and good service.  I got a chorizo hash and it was good, but very spicy.  I probably would try something different next time after seeing some of the other great dishes on other tables.  My wife got a Caesar salad and she enjoyed it."
4068,Hash House A Go Go,5,We were seated for a table of 10 without a reservation immediately. Food was great. The portions were enormous. I recommend sharing dishes between two people. A bit pricy but if you share it is normal.
4069,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I first known of this place from the show man vs food but since the Sahara location is always a bit far from where I normally stay I never really wanted to truck out there. Finally they opened one in Imperial Palace. The place is very modern. Steel walls, booths everywhere, colors are nice.  We had to wait to be seated since the host was never to be found.

The menu is basic but with a twist. They have all the fixins you would want in a breakfast menu. I recommend sticking with the breakfast items because THATS WHAT THEY ARE KNOW FOR!  They have everything from scrambles, to hashes, waffles, combo plates galore! What is nice is all the items come with skillet potatoes, fruit and a huge biscuit!

I ordered the corn beef hash. I have to admit the portion size was HUGE! I would have shared if Ive known they were that big! Everything was good. Potatoes were a bit dry egg was cold. During breakfast time you can only get scrambled eggs, which was WHACK! 

Our server was ok. Didnt really check up on us and he kinda took forever with everything. Would I come back? Perhaps but I would I would want to check out the Sahara location to compare the two."
4070,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Avoid this location of Hash House.  We love the Hash House, have been to the original in San Diego many times and always excellent, even the Sahara Ave one is decent. The HH in the Quad Hotel is a mess. The long wait is not the problem, you get that at HH on a weekend, it was the hour long wait for food after we ordered. Somebody messed up but our sever and 2 other servers who filled our coffee and the manager that came by all told us it was normal wait time. It's not normal, it's a shame this location of HH is managed that way."
4071,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Originally, my group wanted to grab some $7 steak and eggs. Good thing we decided it was too far because we ended up at Hash House A Go Go! No regrets! There is ALWAYS a line, so put your name down, get an approximate wait time, and then go gamble downstairs. Check back 15-20 minutes before your wait time is up because they can give you a better estimate then.

- Corned Beef Hash, red onions and swiss cheese: I don't normally like corned beef because it's too salty, but this dish was awesome!
- Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin with market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped with scrambled eggs: This was probably my favorite dish out of them all. The pork was crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside. The eggs and mashed potatoes complemented the meat quite well.
- Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit: This was also very bomb! That fried chicken-egg-bacon combo is awesome.
- Sage fried chicken with bacon-waffles: Bacon. Waffles. That was such a pleasant surprise! This dish came out last when we were completely full, but my group still devoured it like hungry kids who haven't eaten in a week.

Huge portions of food that satisfied my taste buds and my belly. After dining here, you'll be asking yourself, ""What Vegas body?"" Don't worry, it's totally worth it."
4072,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My husband and I, after looking at what everyone around us ordered, decided to share an entree.  We ordered the Man vs. Food.  It is a benedict with the following layers:  biscuit, mashed potatoes, bacon, tomato, grilled mozzarella and sage fried chicken - topped with chipotle gravy! We ate about 80% of the food.  It was delicious and filling.....a perfect way to start a day walking the strip!"
4073,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Who doesn't love food that taste like its home cooked? Hash house has never disappointed. Their food is always delicious and it can't easily feed two people who want to share. If you get your own food, you will end up taking your food in a to go box. The price is fairly cheap for the amount of food you get.
The only reasons they get 4 out of 5 stars is because they don't have the same menu as the hash house a go go in San Diego. If you are ever in the area you def have to go to the one in San Diego and get the turkey hash. You will not be disappointed!"
4074,Hash House A Go Go,5,Every time I come I forget to post a review but nothing changes good price and a lot of good food keep up the good work
4075,Hash House A Go Go,5,If you are going to Las Vegas in the near future you must go to this place and try the good out! One word amazing
4076,Hash House A Go Go,1,"They focus way too much of food creativity, than taste and service! I ordered the chicken salad. After researching the menu for an hour. Our waiter failed to mention that only 1/2 the menu was available before 5p. I wish I had known earlier! My service was terrible. Food was terrible and my beer was hot! If you go, make sure it's after 5pm!"
4077,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great value, tasty food! We ended up eating dinner here 2 of the 3 nights we were in Vegas. It's conveniently located at the Linq hotel and open 24 hours a day. There is no wait at 9:00 pm, and the portions for dinner are huge. 

The first night we got two appetizers - the ribs with a corn on the cob and crab cakes with pasta. We'd definitely order the ribs again! The corn on the cob was also so deliciously sweet and juicy. We also split a homemade pumpkin cheesecake - it was so huge - and a bit too soft and gloopy for my cheesecake tastebuds. 

The second night we split the Sunday rotisserie chicken plate with mashed potatoes and a corn on the cob! Wow so tasty, all of the three items. One plate left us both satisfied with enough room to get dessert (lots of options right outside the Linq) later in the night."
4078,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is ridiculous. The pancake was huuuuuge and pretty good. Don't order one unless you have someone to share it with. Even if you take it with you, you will not want another pancake for a very long time.  We ended up giving the rest of the pancake to a bum who asked for it outside. 

Service was alright- our server really tried to get us out quickly even though half the restaurant was empty.  

In the end, it's a greasy Denny's on steroids. Probably closer to a 3.5 star review (I'd give their food a 3) but there's something just so outrageous about taking something like chain diner food and making it exponentially more gluttonous. If you have a hangover and can make it down the strip. this place is for you."
4079,Hash House A Go Go,3,"When I arrived there was a long line, assumed it would be pretty awesome food. Luckily we were sat in about 20 minutes, which isn't bad at all. 

Had friendly staff but the food left something to be desired. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were awful, personally LaQuinta has the best waffles â. The chicken was delicious though. Very crispy, very juicy, a lot of flavor. 

Overall was just disappointed because I would've just gotten more chicken had I known how terrible the waffles would be. Even with the bacon infused in the waffle, it was just not good. Probably would not come back here."
4080,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go is my favorite restaurant in the world to eat breakfast. I spent 5 days in Las Vegas last week and I ate there twice, even with a rule that I wouldn't eat at the same place more than once. There are way too many great things I can say about this establishment, so I'll stick to my favorites:

-- The obscure, one-of-a-kind menu: They don't just do chicken and waffles, they do Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. They don't just do a hash or a scramble, they put together a work of art with fried chicken, bacon, hash browns, cheese, eggs, lettuce and tomato on a plate with the most delicious gravy sauce you'd ever taste on a big ole plate.
-- The service: Every waiter and waitress is trained to LOVE what they do. Either that, or they literally cherish their craft. They are psyched to be your waiter and to get you your food as fast as possible.
-- No heat lamps: When food is finished, it's brought out to your table immediately. They don't wait for everyone's food to be prepared and then bring it out and 1 or 2 dishes are cooler. It should be done this way at every restaurant.
-- Artwork: Across the restaurant, celebrities has signed menus and given them feedback about how perfect their menu is. And those celebrities are right.

This is a restaurant in which the food speaks for itself. Man Vs. Food's Adam Richman recently visited and showed how perfect this institution is. It's almost unbelievable how food can have this much flavor. My girlfriend's pancake was as big as a large pizza and tasted like it was injected with flavor. Just the best.

If you're in Vegas, get into Hash House A Go Go immediately and thank me later."
4081,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is popular for good reason! Although it was a bit of a wait, my friends and I entertained ourselves by playing at the casino at the lower level. Once we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter, whom was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu. Wait time for our food to arrive wasn't bad at all! Maybe about 20 minutes. The portions are HUGE! Everything on the menu seemed to be signature, which makes this restaurant unique and one of a kind. If you're on a diet, I offer two suggestions: either you ditch the diet, or just don't go, because this place makes sure you do not leave hungry! My friend ordered the Big Ole Sage Chicken and Waffle Tower. It seriously was enough for two people. I ordered the meatloaf hash. It was SOOOOO good! I ate the leftovers for the rest of that day! When I return to Vegas, I will definitely make my way back to Hash! =)"
4082,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Delicious. Just don't try to eat one by yourself. If you can consume the whole thing w/o any help, you may have an eating disorder."
4083,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was fortunate enough to have come to Hash House when the wait was only 20 minutes for a group of 4. Thank goodness! After reading all the Yelp reviews, I was reconsidering going since many mentioned how long it takes to get seated.

Upon getting seated, we had already decided on splitting 2 dishes since the portions were huge. We ordered the famous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and Salmon Hash House. After seeing a table with a order of waffles, we felt like it was necessary to go all out and overindulge by ordering the granola waffles.

Can I just say this place was beyond good? Perfect food to soak up a hangover...or compliment your already drunk self. I decided to ignore my vegetarian ways and stuff my face with all kinds of meat. My girls and I definitely inhaled all the food.

The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken definitely lived up to the hype. It came topped on split, fresh biscuits with tomato, mozzarella, spinach, chipotle cream, spinach...(so many things on it!). The chipotle cream was delicious with it and the whole entree came with savory mashed potatoes. 

 The Salmon Hash came with scrambled eggs, fresh biscuit, and house potatoes. The salmon was a bit dry, but nothing a little Tabasco and ketchup couldn't fix. Then we topped our meal off with finishing up the granola waffle. The waffles were so moist and tasted amazing. Who would've though about granola waffles? Loved it! If you're a waffle fan, or even if you aren't, you must order the waffles. I'm not even big on waffles, but loved it and would highly recommend ordering it!

All in all, it was an amazing experience! However, the food does take quite a while to come out and never comes out around the same time. So keep this in mind! But hey the portions are huge so no wonder it takes forever."
4084,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is a must when you are visiting Vegas! Yummy huge portions. Perfect after a night out on the town ;)
Sage fried chicken is LEGIT"
4085,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy cow Hash House delivered. The food was excellent, reasonably priced, and the portions were huge! A ""baby burger"" (single patty) with blue cheese and fries hit the spot after a day walking on the strip!"
4086,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We most definitely had to stop here this morning after a night of partying. The food here is amazing,  very large portion, quick service and did I say the drinks are fresh too. This is our go to place every time we're in Vegas.  Glad could get our Bachelorette party here finally!"
4087,Hash House A Go Go,5,The wait is horrific but so worth it. We waitied an hour and a half and still loved it.
4088,Hash House A Go Go,5,Brilliant portions... Great food.. Good prices ...
4089,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Good experience but overall the plates were dry. For example, fried chicken, mash potatoes, biscuit and scrambled eggs. All are great in theory but together are very dry. Possibly a gravy would solve this. The same deal with the Pacers Hash. Possibly a salsa would have helped."
4090,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Red Velvet Pancakes, the greatest bacon ever, and great service earned 5 stars. There was a long wait so sat at the bar and the two servers there were great. 

My wife and I make sure to eat at Hash House every time we visit, great tradition and all of the locations so far met or exceeded our expectations."
4091,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Their portions are HUGE! You can definitely share with someone...... OR get your own and save for later! That is what I did! I got the sage chicken and waffles, my boyfriend got the chicken Benedict, and my family got a whole bunch of other stuff! We came with a BIG party of 13, and they accommodated us so well. We had ONE waiter that did not seem rushed or like she couldn't handle a big party. The food came out fast and tasted so delicious! The flavors in each dish were GREAT! I did think that the chicken Benedict had TOO much going on in one plate, but it was still pretty good. This place is open 24 hours too!"
4092,Hash House A Go Go,2,Terrible terrible service. Busy and bad attitude is what you should expect. Thought to come here because we like the one is SD. But can't get past the nasty attitude of the staff. Complaining about customers. I can't feel bad for them when customerservice is their job!
4093,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Looking for a big breakfast?  Craving coffee and eggs and potatoes and traditional American comfort foods piled in a giant mountain on your plate?

Then Hash House A GO Go is the place for you.

Located on the second floor of a recently renovated casino, they are very popular and often have quite a wait to get inside.

Prices are a little more than diners on the outside, but for right on the Strip, it's a good option, and way cheaper than any of the casino buffets.

You already know if you like this kind of restaurant  If hash and eggs sounds good, then check it out."
4094,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is two months late. First if you tell anyone you are taking them here (and they have never been) you get a bizarre look from them. Doesn't sound like a food place does it? Maybe a gentleman's club? No it is great food. We went in November during the SEMA/AAPEX shows. This one is located inside the LINQ hotel. Go to the back of the hotel and up the escalator and voila - Hash House a Go Go.   - Food on top of food on top of food. It is impossible to leave hungry. It's also impossible to finish your plate so your mom won't be happy with you. :) Everything is huge and over the top. The chicken and waffles is large enough for two very hungry people maybe three. The stuffed burgers are over the top. You probably can't eat your side if you figure out how to finish the burger. Open faced roast beef sandwich...good luck. You salad for dinner people- you aren't finishing either. The wait staff is always a little slow but that doesn't stop me from coming back and it doesn't stop me from bringing clients here for breakfast or dinner. So you start out wide eyed at the huge pile of food in front of you. You muster all the strength you have and try and pick it up - where is my knife and fork, or you dive into it only to find you just ordered enough for 3-4 people. Now you are sitting at the table, catching your breath, sitting up straighter, opening a belt notch and you wonder....what happens to this insane amount of extra food on my plate? Then you look at the other plates on the table and wonder...and theirs. Now you look around at every other table. It hits you - what a terrible waste of food. Maybe we can send it to a staving nation. No. As it turns out they have a pig farm outside of town and all these wonderful leftovers go there. Back to happy again. Seriously you need to go here. Great food and a very interesting experience."
4095,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love the Restaurant.com 80% off deals! $25 gift certificate for $2? Minimum purchase was $35. It was easily done with 2 people. 

My friend and I came here on early Sunday afternoon and it was crazy packed! We put our name down with a wait time of about 30mins. We stood around and started looking around the place and reading the restaurant.com gift certificate. I asked my friend if she read the exclusions prior to coming and she said yes and that everything should be fine. I looked at it and saw ""dinner, dine in only."" We then decided to leave and come back for dinner. I am actually glad we did because when we did, there were no lines! We got a table immediately. We ordered the famous Andy's Sage fried chicken and waffles $18.95 for dinner compared to the $15.95 for breakfast/lunch.

We were given 2 complimentary biscuits which was really filling. I couldn't help but to finish it because our main course took forever! When our chicken and waffles finally came, we then knew we should've shared instead of ordering our own. It came with 2 pieces of chicken stacked with 4 bacon waffles. It was topped with sprigs of rosemary, crispy fried leeks and drizzled with maple syrup. The syrup was really light and not too sweet. The bacon waffles were cooked perfectly. It retained its crispiness even with maple syrup drizzled over it. I love how the bacon was inside the waffle. It was tasty! I am regretting that I didn't even get to finish ONE waffle! I was too full from the chicken :/ next time, I'll bring my husband so he can devour his & MINE. 

For 2 ppl = $21 with restaurant.com gift certificate. Can i get a Hell Yeah!!?"
4096,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Blueberry Pecan flapjacks, that is all!

Of course it wasn't named Hash House for its flapjacks, so I guess I'm gonna recommend trying the hash as well. Portions are huge, enough to share. Service was good. Our server, Mark, was very attentive although I didn't like how he brought the bill over when we weren't even halfway through our meal.

Go right after it opens at 8am, it gets pretty busy even for a weekday.
You can get Total Rewards points for eating here."
4097,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The hotel is a complete dump but don't let that fool you.  The food & service is as good as any 5-star place in Vegas.  The portions are huge & yes - it's a little over the top.  But that's what they do.

Word to the wise who are waiting - there's a bar inside the restaurant & we sat right down & skipped the 30 minute wait.

Also - if you're coming & going via cab...you can get there via Koval Street so you don't have to mess with the traffic on the strip."
4098,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The service wasn't too bad especially based on how busy it was, however I wasn't impressed with the food. We asked our waiter if we could modify an order and he said he couldn't do that, which I felt was strange unless everything was already pre made, which is definitely not true. It was something as simple as switching out the type of lettuce on a salad. The prices weren't bad for Vegas, but it was the best breakfast food I've had."
4099,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Even though I read all the yelp reviews over and over, I guess I forgot about the part where the portions are HUGE! I felt like I barely put a dent in my food. My fiance and I probably should have just shared a dish. The food presentation is awesome. The bloody mary had a nice spicy kick. I couldn't finish it all but the server gave me a to-go cup. We went on a Saturday morning at around 8am and there wasn't a line at all, but by the time we finished eating, there was a pretty long wait."
4100,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My girlfriends and I went in today for brunch...I've always wanted to come here because of that ""Man vs. Food"" episode. I was really looking forward to coming here and I was not disappointed.  The food and the service were both STELLAR.

First: Our server.
He was being trained and his name was PJ.  Though he was a ""trainee"", he served us like a seasoned pro.  This guy recommended our tangerine mimosas and they were awesome!  PJ made sure that we were really taken care of, and I was really happy about the fact that I never had to flag him for a coffee refill.  He was on top of it. Very attentive!  If you're ever here, look for this guy to be your waiter.  You won't miss him: very charming with a nice smile.  Great job!

Now, the FOOD! Per PJ's recommendation (thanks again!) we had the fried chicken benedict along with the chicken and waffles.We ended up sharing because it was SOOOOOO goood!!!!!!!

I highly recommend this place.  I will definitely return.  GREAT service (PJ!) and EXCELLENT food!!!!"
4101,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Was sent her by a friend for breakfast.  I will likely never eat breakfast anywhere else in Vegas.  Their menu, service, atmosphere, presentation, portions and the FOOD were amazing.  All this for half the price of other restaurants on the strip. 
Walking through Harrah's and the Imperial Palace to get there is like a trip back to the 70s as well."
4102,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great portions and tastes. I bought breakfast here and had enough to take leftovers and had lunch too. Saved money for the win! I think I got the The Tractor Driver Combo with the Waffle upgrade.
4103,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here at night after a long day/night out and the wait was very short. I have to say that finding the place wasn't easy, because phone navigation doesn't say that it's located inside a casino. We made the choice of going into the casino as a short cut and ran into the restaurant by mistake (even tho it was our intended location). 

The food was amazing, it tastes exactly as expected and the size portions are HUGE. I would recommend sharing a plate with someone. 

We got the hot chocolate and it was too big, I wouldn't suggest getting it. It tastes fine, but it was too much to drink and while still having to eat all the food. I would stick to the water. We ordered the chicken waffles plate, the Benedict chicken plate, sweet potato fries, and the banana flapjack pancakes. I just saw that they have a location in Chicago and I will definitely be back!"
4104,Hash House A Go Go,1,"People reviewing this place are drunk.  The one thing that can be said is that the portions are big.  That's it.  Service  is terrible and is VERY slow.  The signature dish of chicken and waffles was TERRIBLE.  The chicken is so dry and bland that you literally have to drink water just to wash it down.  It was honestly one of the worst breakfasts that I have ever paid for.  Breakfast is one of the most difficult meals to screw up, but these guys managed to do it."
4105,Hash House A Go Go,4,Disgusting giant portions of food. We had the chicken and waffles and rancheros dish. The chicken and waffles could've been plenty for two.  Service was okay. Ended up giving half my meal to a homeless person.
4106,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Not great.  Not bad.  Not sure if I would say good.  Gigantic portions.  Weird, awkward ambience.  Wouldn't go back.  If I had it to do over again, wouldn't go in the first place."
4107,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Plates are huge!!! Just share.... also, bring a sweater. They have it set on Ice Age. Since it was 107 degrees outside,  we were wearing shorts and tank tops. We were a bit uncomfortable as we couldn't stop shivering."
4108,Hash House A Go Go,4,Portion size is so much you can share your meal with someone else. The pancakes are like 3 normal pancakes in thickness and a small pizza ratio. It's good for hangovers and hits the spot! Flavorful and everything is cooked to order. They're open 24hrs and if you bring your receipt during a certain time you get 10% off! Wait isn't long either. An affordable worth while experience!!!
4109,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went for brunch and went for we are drunk at 3am and need food. Both  were great we were staying at the hotel so convenient for us. Portions are HUGE so prices reflect that so they are definitely not over priced. And the food is amazing. Random stuff together? They some how make it work. And if you sit at the bar bug RJ aka RON JEREMY but I have dubbed him Andre 3000 either way great food, fun staff!"
4110,Hash House A Go Go,5,Omg! Talk about gigantic plates! I love this place and its my go to place late at night when um craving some food. Everyone must try this place. It's worth it!
4111,Hash House A Go Go,2,"There is a lot of food on the plate, but it is really just average. The Bloody Mary was fabulous, but nothing about the food would make me want to come back again."
4112,Hash House A Go Go,3,"later at night while craving breakfast food we discovered this place down the strip. whats good was the immediate seating, the fast service, and huge portions! the server was nice and made sure he kept checking up on us too. 

all of our portions were huge so we all took half of our entrees home. the only negative though, was later when i got to the hotel and wanted to eat the other half- i discovered one strip of bacon only half-cooked."
4113,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG!!!!!  This place is the best!  It was three of us (girls) and we ordered the #15 burger, the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and chicken and waffles. It was amazing!!  EVERYTHING was delicious!  We couldn't eat it all.  Prices aren't bad either they were around $15-18. Service was also great!  I would definitely recommend going here at least once while in Vegas when your really hungry!!!"
4114,Hash House A Go Go,3,The portions were huge but overall the quality was just okay. It could have been this particular location because I remember my last visit at the Sahara location was amazing. Our server meant well and was very friendly but the service was a bit sluggish. We waited quite a bit for our wine once we ordered & a cobb salad and flat bread took almost 50min to come out. It was a mellow Tuesday night. The food tasted pretty good but I probably wouldn't choose to eat here again.
4115,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A must visit while in town. BEWARE The portions are huge! Make a reservation! We order andys chicken and it was more food then the two of us could eat. There was so much food and it was so good. I wish i ate there everyday. Ps the pancakes are massive, falling off the plate huge."
4116,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here for breakfast twice while staying in Las Vegas. Good food, good prices and good service. You do have to try and avoid the rush or the wait will be quite long at times. We ate very well here and after eating their breakfast (both of us had a scramble on the first day we ate there at about 8:30 AM) it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon by the time we were hungry again, and we were walking the strip all day. Definitely worth a visit and if we ever return to Las Vegas that will be our first port of call for breakfast.
Thank you."
4117,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love having brunch at this place in San Diego so of course when I'm in Vegas, it's no different for me. Some things to take note of this place:
-They believe in the farm to table concept (Love it!)
-The portions are huge
-There's always a wait
-Their world famous chicken and waffles needs to be shared
-Most of their food can't be finished by one person so come prepared to share or for leftovers. 

We waited 35 minutes, got seated and ordered our fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee. Their coffee is insane, there's a whole page on their coffee alone. Try their nitro coffee, it's well worth it. 

I split my chicken and waffles and got a side of eggs, still couldn't finish my waffles, I was just too full.

This place is worth checking out. Unpretentious. Good food. Large portions. Open 24/7."
4118,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Visited this location as it was on the Strip.  A bit difficult to find in the Imperial Palace, but it was worth the slight inconvenience.

I thought about the Sage Chicken Benedict, but I saw another customer receive one and it looked like way too much food for me.

Had the Corned beef hash instead and ate every last bite.  Good quality corned beef and the potatoes were nicely seasoned and had nice crust to them."
4119,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Overhyped. Overhyped. Overhyped. The food doesn't taste good and it comes out in huge portions. A big plate of non yummy food. I feel like breakfast made at home taste way better than this. Save your money. Do it yourself. 

Mushroom burger - meat was kind of dry, big burger. Also pricey but not tasty. Whyyyyy. 

Basic - ham, over medium egg, crispy potatoes. This is a super basic dish and I picked this because everything else looked really intense and they still managed to serve me something that I can make better myself. 

Sage fried chicken - dried chicken, it also tasted kind of sweet. Gross. 

Original hash Benedict - loads of food but also meh. The bacon tasted like pork rinds. 

Banana pancake - this thing is huge! I would say this is the best tasting out of everything we ordered but they also forgot to put this in and it took forever to come out. We finished our food, paid for the bill, and waited an extra 15mins for this pancake. 

I won't be back."
4120,Hash House A Go Go,2,"High expectations but doesn't really deliver.  

Pros: The portions are HUGE.  

Cons:
Drinks: The coffee is pretty weak.  The fresh squeezed orange juice is sour.  

Food: 
Sage Fried Chicken - This dish starts out okay.  I really liked the fried scallions but in the end, the breading didn't have enough ""maple infusion"" so that it lacked flavor.  The meat was also pretty dry.  

Roasted Chicken Hash - Giant pieces of chicken breast cooked with various vegetables and potatoes.  Sounds like it had potential but the pieces of chicken are so dry and tasteless as to almost be inedible.  The scrambled eggs were okay but the biscuit was blah.  

I really wanted to like this place after reading all the reviews and all the hype but it's definitely not my favorite place for brunch.  I doubt it'll be yours after you try this place either."
4121,Hash House A Go Go,2,"PLEASE go somewhere else. I've been here multiple times (not by choice), and each time, I regret agreeing to go! Here's the experience every time:

- extremely long wait time, barely any seating, large parties, and no windows. you feel like you're a steer in a cattle call. they don't give pagers, so venture out into the casino at your own risk of missing your reservation. 

- portions are ridiculous and filled with carbs. my eggs benedict had ONE fried egg on top of two biscuits and a pile of mashed potatoes. The sauce was nothing special. same goes with the breakfast quesadilla - a giant flour tortilla stuffed with mashed potatoes and about two scrambled eggs. the ratio of carbs to actual food is ridiculous.  don't go for breakfast if you plan on having a pool day -  you won't want to put on a bathing suit after eating here for sure. 

- bloody mary was weak, watery, and not spicy at all. 

the only redeeming qualities: the servers are always very nice, it's open 24 hours, and my husband loves their specialty pancakes, which i admit, are good."
4122,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. The waiting list to get seating was over 45 minutes but we figured that the food had to be good if this many people were trying to get in. Once we were seated we were greeted by our server rather quickly. We got our drinks quickly but it took almost another 45 minutes to get our food. We saw people that came in after us get some of the dishes we had ordered before us. We came to the conclusion and the frustrated and apologetic server agreed that other servers were taking his food orders so we had to wait for our food to be recooked. My food was great, i ordered a brown sugar banana pancake with bacon, eggs and potatoes. Of course I couldn't eat all of it, the portions were humongous. If you think everything is big in Texas, think again, Las Vegas has some hearty plates of food! My husband ordered he chicken and waffles. The presentation was more appealing than the food itself. My husband's waffles were doughy probably because the server was rushing the cook to remake our original order that another server stole. We probably should have complained to the manager but seeing that we didn't want to waste time being negative and we came to Vegas to have fun we let it slide. Paid for the food and went on our way. The coolest bing about this restaurant was my souvenir class for my mimosas. Much to my surprise it was a leg with a fishnet stocking and a black stiletto heel. I loved it and I didn't mind the $20 it costs!"
4123,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great view..! Very nice place to eat, loved the menu. I chose the Chicken & Waffles, and they did not disappoint. Service was great. Will return and highly recommend."
4124,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Mega size servings is what you'll get at this place.

I had the chicken benedict thingy and it was great!  I've had better waffles though...would never order that again.  It was dense, dry, and soooo NOT fluffy.  It must've weighed at least 2lbs.  

We got there right when they opened on a Sunday so we didn't have to wait long.  I understand the wait can be super long most of the time...you've been warned.  All in all it was a great dining experience."
4125,Hash House A Go Go,1,"EPIC FAILURE! 

Made a special trip here from the Hilton and they were out of Corned Beef! WTH! Hash - Corned Beef - HellooOOOooo! 

In any case I couldn't waste the trip so I ordered the Meatloaf Hash and eggs over medium and the Tangerine juice. The eggs were done correctly but were cold, the biscuit was dense and flavorless, and the hash was just not good. The chunks of meatloaf and potatoes were HUGE and the meatloaf was cold. With the pieces are so large I couldn't get multiple ingredients in my mouth at the same time and I am Japanese! (Ever eat sushi?) The tangerine juice was good and the service and decor was all right. 

All in all a waste of my time and $30 (food, tip, and transportation) and to top it off it didn't set well with me at all. Hash House A GOGO if you know what I mean."
4126,Hash House A Go Go,4,My goodness! Talk about Portions that can feed a village! One plate can be shared between at least 2 people. Their clear winner is the chicken waffles.
4127,Hash House A Go Go,4,Amazing food. We went for lunch on Monday and had to wait about 45 minutes. Once seated the atmosphere was really fun. Retro farmhouse . Our waitress was nice and gave great service. I highly recommend sharing an entree because they are enormous portions . We got a burger with mashed potatoes and bacon in the middle of 2 1/4 lb patties. The burger had excellent flavor and the fries were super crispy . We also got a side of fried chicken which was a filleted chicken breast and the breaking had excellent flavor and was done to perfection .
4128,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Legit good food. Fried chicken and waffles where on point!! Just way too much two people could share it. 

Decently priced too."
4129,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First, I must say besides the wait they so deserve 5 stars everytime.  This place was packed and I figured out why as soon as my food was placed in front of me.  They give you so much food you have to share it with someone else.  I ordered the banana maple & brown sugar pancake, at first I was was hesitant because i didn't want to pay $7.00 for one pancake, but man when I tell you one pancake is the size of a medium pizza, I am not kidding!!!!  It was soooooooo delicious, I wish there was one of these spots in Atlanta, I would definitely be a regular customer, even though i would also have to keep a gym memerbship if I ate here on a regular basis.  This is a must visit restaurant on every trip to Vegas for sure!!!!"
4130,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Sadly, the hash house used to be so much better, but I guess there's no way to crank out so many meals and maintain high quality.

But you would hope that when your name is Hash House, you'd make the best hash around. Instead, they just deep fry potatoes and call it hash.

It's still a fun atmosphere, but more like a theme park than a really good diner."
4131,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had waAaaaaayyyyyy too much food for one sitting. Made it lunch and dinner! Was still awesome l! However, everything was tasty and the pancake was bigger then my hand!"
4132,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After reading reviews we decided to go to this place for brunch.

When we arrived there was a long line but thankfully they served delicious bloody Mary's. Definitely worth getting one.

When we sat down we ordered two entrees to share between 3 people. It was more than enough. We ordered an omelet and an eggs Benedict. It was better than another brunch place in Vegas but not the best I've had. I would come back but I can't give it 5 stars. Coffee wasn't good by the way."
4133,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here late night (as in 5 in the morning). 

They didn't have their full menu at this time but you still get the feel that this place doesn't joke around with portions. 

This particular HHAGG is difficult to find but I will say that the employees here in this restaurant as well as the casino were EXTREMELY FRIENDLY. 

All in all, it's a safe place to go for a group of hungry people who are perhaps a bit intoxicated."
4134,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place came highly recommended and I see precisely why.  We went for brunch for my best friend's birthday and it was ah-mazing!  There was a short wait to be seated but once we were, it was smooth sailing from there.  The menu had a lot of options, which made it hard to decide but I finally settled on the roasted chicken house hash.  It had garlic, onions, asparagus, rosemary, crispy potatoes topped with two eggs (I got them sunny side up), fresh fruit, and a biscuit.  It also came with fresh strawberry preserves that were out of this world.  My eating companions got the chicken pot pie, the sage fried chicken and waffles, and the sage fried fried farm benedict.  All the portions were huge!  I literally had to eat my in 3 different sittings.  Everyone one of us had a carry out!  The taste, presentation, service and portion sizes were all wonderful.  Our waiter, Nathan, was also awesome!  My best friend accidentally dropped her carryout on the floor and it spilled out before we could even make it out the door.  Nathan was nice enough to get her some fried chicken and biscuits to go free of charge.  Now that's top of the line service!  The mixed drinks were also tasty and pretty.  If you're even in Vegas, you must make a trip to Hash House A Go Go, you will not regret it!"
4135,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Went here late night going for some good eats, but was very disappointed to find out that they only have 1/4 of their menu available. Everything was super unhealthy but my fiance and I ordered the 2 healthiest items we could find. Unfortunately, the salad was horrible, poor quality lettuce, excessive cheese, funky tasting turkey. My boyfriend ordered their basic breakfast with egg whites, which was good but how could you mess that up!?... needless to say, I won't be going back.

Giving them 2 stars for having a delicious biscuit and good service."
4136,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is sooo awesome! Love coming here and bringing my family from out of town to try this place. Chicken and Waffles is sooo delicious. The flavors all together is like a party in your mouth. Definitely worth the money and the portions are HUGE! You can either share your plate or take the rest to eat for later.
I ordered my son a banana pancake off the kids menu, Lord! That thing was bigger than his head! You can probably feed 4 kids with that portion lol.
I will always come back here, check it out!"
4137,Hash House A Go Go,4,Just visited 2 days ago while in Vegas and I highly recommend this place. I had the Tractor Driver Plate and could not finish it all. I would go again and again!
4138,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions were huge. You could definitely make three meals with the stuffed burger entree. Is this luxury dining? No. If you want a higher quality better tasting version of Applebee's, then I would highly recommend. I would skip an appetizer and the big dinner roll (wasn't very good) they give you at the beginning of the meal to save room for your entree. The service is also very quick and friendly."
4139,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The only reason I gave it a 3/5 was the location at the shitbox that is Imperial Palace. I despise that hotel. It stinks, and you can easily get lost trying to find the restuarant.  Aside from that, prepared to come early cause after the popularity of Man vs Food this spot has become known. Portions are huge. I had the fried chicken eggs benedict and brown sugar banana pancakes. Let's say after I devoured it, I probably should've napped for hours. It was very delicious and pretty affordable compared to a Vegas buffet or something. Would like to try the location a little off the strip from Man vs. Food episode."
4140,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We heard a couple people talk about this place just in passing and my husband, FIL and BIL are all obsessed with hash so we had to try it. Because we had our little one, they slid us in earlier so they wouldn't have a crying baby on their hands (smart) and our waiter was awesome. He was witty, funny, fast and accommodating. The mimosa in the leg was so funny, we had to get that, and my eggs benedict with fried chicken was amazing!!! If this was in our home town we would be in trouble."
4141,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious, delicious, delicious!
Make sure to try the green fried tomatoes.
Deaneli our server did an amazing job!
Make sure to share a meal if you're not that hungry, they're portions a huggggge"
4142,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go is definitely a new favorite of mine. We stopped by for dinner before our evening outings. The place was only at 50% capacity,  but for some reason as a table of 7 we were forced to wait 15 minutes. 

Our server was very cheery and helpful but service overall was quite slow. He would linger for too long when we didn't need him, yet completely disappear when we required something. Very annoying. 
Service: D+ (-1 star for that)

I ordered the Tractor Driver combo: two eggs + sausage accompanied by one gigantic pancake. Opted for the brown sugar banana flappy for an extra $1. Eggs and sausage were nothing special, but that pancake was absolutely insane. 1.5 feet in diameter with at-least two bananas inside! Tasty but overall too sweet, and too much of it; like trying to eat bananas foster alone for dinner. I barely ate half of the pancake. 

Thankfully the girlfriend's [chicken] breast was the perfect savory item to balance my sweets. Delicious with yet again very generous portions. I'd be tempted to order this next time. 

Others ordered the chicken pot pie and meat loaf: only good things to say about them. Even the kid's cheeseburger looked decent and large enough to satisfy the average adult. Everything was reasonable priced as well. Most items were $12-$20. Very impressed. 
Food: A-

**Tips
-Don't be the fool that fills up on those delectable honey biscuits. 
-If your name isn't Takeru Kobayashi, you're not going to finish your food. Don't try to be a hero, son. 
-Not in the mood to devour a small animal? You better split something. 

Definitely A Go Go for me!"
4143,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was pretty okay. We had the corned beef hash, kiwi watermelon lemonade, and half tea/half lemonade.

Service: Our waitress disappeared for an extremely long time and didn't come back so we had to ask someone else for help.

Corned beef hash: It was okay. I was expecting hashbrowns, but it was actually made with potatoes.

Both lemonades were a bit bland so I was expecting more.

Decent food and terrible service when it wasn't even at a busy time."
4144,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Just okay food, the portions are huge so it is a god value. The bluberry pecan pancakes was my favorite, The meatloaf hash was lacking in flavor . Will find a new breakfast spot next time im in Vegas, but it was worth trying though."
4145,Hash House A Go Go,5,"SOOOOOO GOOD! I couldn't have asked for any better food! The s'mores mocha was amazing and delicious! We also ordered eggs, potatoes, French toast, and pancakes. Wow!!!

All three of us were blown away and we have recommended this place over and over! Will absolutely go back!"
4146,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great place to eat. We had the eggs Benedict man vs food. Very different very rich the wife and I shared it and had a hard time eating it all.
4147,Hash House A Go Go,4,Love love this place! Came here for a friends birthday and we couldn't have been any happier. The staff was a little rude but not too bad. We came here on a Sunday and had to wait a little over an hour to be seated but so worth the wait. I recommend anyone who is visiting Vegas to come and give this place a try! Generous amount of food and a fun environment. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the customer service aside from that I had a fabulous experience.
4148,Hash House A Go Go,5,Had the salmon scramble . Flavor explosion in my mouth. The potatoes are crispy to a perfection. Love the Rosemary touch . Portion sizes are gimmicky like claim jumper but the quality of the giant pancake is fantastic.
4149,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was so excited to try the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles but it just did not meet my expectations. Also, I didn't even realize my meal was off until the end but I was too disappointed to bother bringing it up to our waiter. The idea of Sage Fried Chicken sounds amazing but mine just wasn't all that great. The batter was bland. The chicken was soo dry that after every bite I felt the need to down mouthfuls of water just to get it all down without choking. I got only one piece of chicken rather than two with the four bacon waffles. So essentially, I paid $18.50 for one piece of super dry fried chicken and four mediocre waffles. I thought I wad trippin that I somehow forgot that I ate the chicken or bf ate it when I wasnt looking but I confirmed my suspicions with the picture I took.

I like that the dish is beautifully garnished but I dont like that they pour the syrup on the waffles prior to bringing it out. I normally don't like too much syrup on my waffles so that was disappointing and it came out soggy because it had been sitting.
The only thing I absolutely liked was the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade. It tasted refreshing after an exhausting day on the strip. The server was nice and kept our glasses full but the food wasnt all that great. On that note, I may be back to try another dish but the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles was just wayy too disappointing and definitely not worth the money for just that one piece. :("
4150,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're looking for a good meal that is farm fresh come here.  This is not your traditional coffee, eggs, and toast farm fresh meal it is  much more.  The portions are huge also, I recommend splitting a meal with someone.  Be prepared to wait though as this is a really popular place both times I have been here I had to wait about 30 minutes.  Once I got inside it only took about 20 minutes to get my food once I was seated.  They have really good Bloody Mary's lemonades and chocolate milk.  I recommend getting Andy's sage fried chicken - spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs."
4151,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This place is so gross. I went with a group of 8 and we each got different things. And no one enjoyed their food. Each plate was full of food but had ZERO flavor. Also, the service was not the greatest. Had to wait about 10 minutes just for our drinks to come and the place was not even crowded. The waiters were seriously lacking. 10/10 would NOT recommend."
4152,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Highly recommended by our Son we decided to try it. Party of 4 and each ordered different menu choices. Everything was delicious .. and HUGE! Thank you for great service too, Billy"
4153,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I ordered a Burger with avocado, bacon and cheese. The bacon tasted a little funny to me so I took it out but the crispy fries were delicious. The portions are HUGE I only hate half my burger and half my fries. But for the price it's cheap for the amount of food you get. I got the blue lemonade drink and it was good, not to sweet!"
4154,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This was my third time here, and it's questionable if it will be my last. 

The main reason to come here would be if you are hungry, don't feel like paying for a buffet, and want a comfort food experience. The price works out to be about the same as you would pay at Wicked Spoon or other breakfast/lunch buffet. Keep that in mind as you read the rest of this review. 

Food Quality:
It's definitely ""comfort food,"" they do not mislead you there. But is it high quality? No. Taste? Flavorful. Sure, the sage fried chicken and waffles was more flavorful than your average chicken. I'll give them innovation points there. Also, the chicken pot pie crust + cream sauce filling was well-seasoned, using thyme and rosemary to add some unique flavor. 

Food Quantity: 
Huge portions. Come hungry. But the food is rich, so it's hard to put down a whole large skillet full, especially if you plan to be a functioning Vegas-goer the rest of the day. 

Service:
Terrible service. The wait is long to get into the restaurant. Every time I have been here they manage to skip my name, claiming they ""called me twice."" Our waitress this last time literally talked my boyfriend out of ordering what he wanted and made him feel super awkward. 

Ambiance:
Nightmarish. Very loud. Seating arrangement is to cram as many people in as possible, so you're literally facing people and their plates. It's hard not to stare at what your neighbor ordered because the portions are huge. 

Price:
Ok, so you're getting a LOT of food. But does that justify the $17.99 price tag? I think that's the question I am struggling with. 

So, it really comes down this: Does the flavor and comforting gimmick of the food outweigh the long wait and hefty bill? Questionable. I'm really torn about whether I will be back, but I know that there are much better places to eat in Vegas."
4155,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My first time in Vegas, residents suggested Hash House A Go Go! The food was awesome and large portions. My friends and I brought back leftovers to our hotel for the next morning. I wouldn't suggest you do the same. The food wasn't that great the next morning lol!"
4156,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Dude. The servings here are HUGEEEEEEE. 
Came here was a party of 5 on a Sunday night, the wait was about 15mins even though you can clearly see that they had a lot of open tables, but whatever they were probably understaffed or something....

Me and 2 other friends decided to spilt an order of the crispy pork tenderloin, and we couldn't finish it. This dish is big enough to probably feed 4-5 little asian (semi hungover) girls. No lie. AND the food was good.The pork tasted like chicken, the mushroom and sauce was good. Everyone also got a honey glazed biscuit, which were also hugeeee (surprise surprise!) but it wasn't my favorite since it was really dry.

Overall, I would recommend this place. Great place if you want to get stuffed and not pay the price of a Vegas buffet."
4157,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Such a good place to visit while we were in Vegas! We came back here again and again because the food, service, atmosphere was perfect. Every time a waitress or waiter would walk by with a plate of food everyone would stare and ask the person who received it what they ordered. Every time something came out everyone was amazed! You know you're doing something right when everybody is surprised and  delighted every time. It's a must go if you're in Vegas!"
4158,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What can I say that Hasn't already been said about the most amazing breakfast spot in all of San Diego. It's not just the enormous portions that are awesome. All the different flavors and recipes are second to none. Who doesn't love a gourmet pancake the size of a truck tire? The only complaint if you could call it that is the ridiculous lines on the weekends. I have waited well over an hour even for a small party to get in there so you must be disciplined and get out of bed and over to the restaurant at or before 9 AM in order to secure your spot for this delicious delight. The atmosphere and ambiance is great, it's not considered rude or obnoxious to ogle over the plates of other people's food to window shop and figure out what you want to order for your breakfast feast. Enjoy this tasty treat!!!"
4159,Hash House A Go Go,5,Expect a wait to get in but the food is worth every minute. We got some French toast and the ham and spinach scramble. Portions are huge so plan on sharing. Coffee was nice and strong. Would definitely come back.
4160,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Very obvious why the line is always out the door and you would not regret waiting whatever time is requested that you wait. I really wish I remembered her name, she wears a solid braid down her back, super cool and attentive waitress was also a factor in how good this place is. Unfortunately with places this busy you usually meet people that are busy and frustrated to be working in a place that has that much turnover but she was cool, calm and collected. Not one of us had a bad meal, from the corned beef SOOOOO GOOD to the chicken and waffles... nothing disappointed."
4161,Hash House A Go Go,5,I think anything with the sage fried chicken is going to be amazing! It smells awesome! I was speechless when the waiter came to check on us. All i could say was O.M.G! The serving size is huge. Fit for 2.
4162,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place is like food for giants, not unlike many places in Vegas.  The portions are huge and if you finish it, you are not any average person.  The menu was also huge.  My friend and my boyfriend had a hard time deciding, but we had plenty of time because the place was packed.

I would've rated this higher if I didn't have such a bad experience with what I had.  I had one of the house hashes, which I was not familiar with until it was served to me.  Roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary house hash turned out to be that with some crispy potatoes and some fruit and biscuit.  The chicken was amazingly dry and flavorless.  I took the rest home, but I don't know why because I knew I wasn't going to eat it.  I couldn't even salvage it with some seasonings because it was so dry.

My boyfriend's sage fried chicken eggs benedict was good, but still not enough for me to go back for it.  My friend's quesadilla was like a high pancake folded in half, it was pretty hilarious.  He liked his plate too...so I guess I was the only one.  Next time, if I ever go again, maybe I'll ask the regulars what they enjoy eating.  Still, I'd rather be able to try out the menu and not be afraid it'll either taste great or disgusting."
4163,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait for a Sunday brunch was average but well worth the wait. The food was yummy, the portion sizes are huge, the prices are great. Definitely get a biscuit with their in house made strawberry jam. It's delicious!!!"
4164,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is perfect breakfast to recover from an amazing night! They serve large portions of food and I was stuffed after finishing my meal. I highly recommend this place. I'd definitely come here next time I come to Vegas!
4165,Hash House A Go Go,5,"LETS GET THIS STRAIGHT...anyone who gives this place less than FIVE STARS had an anomaly of an experience or is a miserable human who is never happy or satisfied with anything. My wife and I are in Vegas for a 48 hours for work and got stuck at the Flamingo. The only redeeming thing to staying there is the close proximity to the Linq which houses Hash House. 

We went there last night and this morning and tried 3 different entrees which were ALL outstanding. First the portions are HUGE and easily can be shared. If you are going for breakfast get two items and they will last you the day! We have been to Hash House before so as much as we like the Chicken and Waffles we got the staple fried chicken benedict and then ventured out and tried the brown sugar banana pancakes and meatloaf hash! 

For being as large and crowded as the restaurant was the food came out much faster than anticipated! All of the ingredients are fresh and fused with other home style staples. For instance who would order meatloaf for breakfast!?!? It was outstanding with the eggs cooked to order and the vegetables from the farm to the table. The pancake was the size of a golf cart wheel and was candied with the cinnamon and brown sugar baked into the pancake and banana slices spread throughout. Amazing and I have no idea how to tell you which one of the four meals I've had is the best...impossible to choose.

For this Vegas visit though, it was the barback service that was second to none and ran like a well oiled machine! RJ was our incredible charismatic server but the other bar backs were accommodating and treated us as their own customers! Lots of choices in Vegas to eat but believe the hype, be patient, and then be satisfied and beyond glad you are here!"
4166,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went at noon on a Friday and it was packed. Had a bit of a wait for a table but that is to be expected. Once seated, a great dining experience. Those waiters and busboys more than earn their tips. For how busy it was, we were served pretty quickly. I have been to a HHAGG before but it was my husbands first time and he enjoyed it as much as I did. We split a brown sugar banana pancake and still had way too much left over. It is a very loud place so if that isn't your thing, wouldn't recommend it during busy hours."
4167,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Not sure if we came on an off day, but we were all utterly dissapointed with our first time at Hash House a Go Go. 

Was really looking forward to trying this place on our last day. I thought our party of 5 would have to wait forever on Sunday at noon, but surprisingly, we were seated in less than 15 minutes. First off, it was like a sauna at the ""Quad"" and upstairs at Hash House a Go Go. Not a good experience to start off with, and the hostess was a bit rude, saying EVERYONE must be present to be seated. Understood.

We were seated in a cozy booth towards the back, and luckily, it wasn't as hot back there. Our waiter took our drink orders, and 2 of us ordered their famous kiwi watermelon lemonade. One ordered a coffee, and he brought a total of 2 waters for 5 of us, even though others wanted water. The fruity lemonade was refreshing and not overly sweet. They serve it with boba straws!

My friend and I decided to share the famous fried chicken benedict. As a benny fan, I was really excited to try this Man Vs. Food staple. Another ordered the salmon benedict, a salmon hash, and the fried chicken and waffles.

Food came out pretty quickly, and the portions are HUMONGOUS! I was so glad someone agreed to share with me. Overall, the dish was okay, nothing out of this world. The best part was the biscuit.

Friend's smoked salmon benedict was actually cooked, some overly cooked and dry. When she mentioned to the waiter that it wasn't smoked salmon as it said, he got really defensive and said it is smoked, but when they cook it as a benedict, it cooks that way. Friends hash had very badly burnt potatoes, and he agreed that the biscuit was the best part.

Felt bad for the friend that got the fried chicken and waffles. He said the chicken had no flavor and very dry. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the middle, but I think it would be tastier if they crumbled the bacon and put in the batter.

Overall, I would try again, but maybe a different location. I"
4168,Hash House A Go Go,5,Very delicious + huge portion + nice food display. I was WOW WOW WOW when the waitress brought me the food. Friendly service too. Highly recommend for big party and if you are ready to gain 5 lbs after the meal :-)
4169,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hands down AMAZING! Great service! We did have to wait but it was worth the wait. Make sure to eat slow!!! So yummy!
4170,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm a big fan of his place. Very creative and high quality breakfast options. Portions are gigantic. Everything is very fresh and tasty. A ton of things to try but they obviously specialize in various ""hashes"" as well as benedicts, scrambles, and pancakes/waffles. They are known for their fried chicken which I haven't been able to get myself to commit to for breakfast but I'm sure it is excellent. Our server was super friendly and attentive. He even gave us to-go cups for coffee and juice. It gets crowded so go early or be prepared to wait. Lunch and dinner options also looked tasty but I've only been for breakfast...twice on my recent Vegas trip."
4171,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just returned from a great trip to Las Vegas.  We won enough money to cover all of our expenses and some purchases.  Regardless of how good our luck was, the part I cannot stop thinking about was Hash House a Go Go.  

We are returning to Las Vegas in October and will for sure be eating here again, at least one time.  On our trip my wife has the Biscuits & Gravy while I had the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles.  Both of these were fantastic, as well as our server (she may have been the bartender?) Kye.  

Couple things to know:

-You may not get your food at the same time at the table (they do not have heat lamps).  Our server told us this up front, we couldn't care less.

-The portions were ridiculously huge.  I can take down a TON of food, and i could not finish my waffles (probably could have had I not ate a bunch of my wife's food).

-The drinks, (in comparison to other specialty drinks in LV) were fairly priced - $8 for 20oz.  I had the Champagne Supernova with my breakfast and thought it was wonderful.

We have been to probably 30+ restaurants on the strip ranging from uber expensive to very cheap.  Overall this is the most pleased I have been at any restaurant in LV, and I cannot wait to go back.  I was referred by my brother (much more of a foodie than I) as he thought t was awesome, and I have heard from other friends (after the fact) that they loved this place too."
4172,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Pretty large portion size for a reasonable price. May want to share with someone. The food is your typical brunch foods like chicken and waffles, pancakes, sanwiches, biscuit gravy type of deal. The wait can be long. Also there is no phone reception so if you are waiting and are trying to reach the rest of your party that is gambling good luck with that because they won't seat you until your whole party is present.  Overall this place is ok, there are so many more grand options in vegas for brunch why limit yourself eating here?!"
4173,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went about 8am on a Monday. There was a wait, but I think we waited maybe 10 min. Our server was very fast & efficient & the food was DELICIOUS!!!! I got the hashes w/ the veggies...artichoke, mushroom, spinach & sundried tomatoes. It was better than I expected & the homemade biscuits are to die for! My husband ordered the blueberry pancakes & was very impressed. The coffee is amazing too. Would definitely recommend & go back!"
4174,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The fried chicken and waffles at this place has to be the best I have ever eaten. It's huge enough to feed two or by yourself if you are extremely hungry. One plate comes with two pieces of chicken and four waffles. It appears to be an image of a pineapple with the green garment acting as the leaf. You actually have to hold the garment and the plate at the same time so the chicken won't topple over. The chicken was crispy, not greasy, flavorful and all white meat. The waffles had bacon in them! It was fluffy, juicy and delicious.

The wait was about 45 minutes to get a table but well worth it. The service was good where our waiter was attentive to all our needs."
4175,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Thought it was all hype. 

Staff is very friendly. Food came quite fast. 
I'm from SoCal where ""roscoes chicken and waffles"" is OVERLY hyped. 

I sweatergod this place crushes roscoes. Chicken is perfectly breaded with corn flakes. The waffles have bacon stuffed in them. I'm not a huge person so I only managed to eat 2 waffles and one chicken breast. I highly recommend you share it with whoever you come with. That actually goes for all their portions."
4176,Hash House A Go Go,5,Had their sage fried chicken and waffle tower. It was delicious!! The portion was quite large for one person. The chicken was very crispy and flavorful. The waffles are crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Very tasty.
4177,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was pretty much the highlight of my Vegas trip after staying in a dirty room at Harrah's for three days.  I luckily was able to talk my in-laws into going to this place on our last day after this place was featured on a Travel Channel documentary.  Everything was as I imagined it and more.  The food was amazing and my in-laws actually loved it too.  The portions are HUGE.  Three people could easily share 1 buttermilk pancake and be full.  You really could eat here and be done for the rest of the day.  The food is very fresh and as a beer fan, I loved that one of the items on the menu was a cheap tall can in a brown paper bag. Classy!  The restaurant was very clean and I loved the farmhouse decor.  It was like eating in a clean, hip barn.  Everything we ordered for breakfast was great, and I am guessing lunch and dinner are just as good.  It only lost a star because the waiters and our waitress had some 'tude.  Our waitress did not come check on us once we were given our food and I never saw her again to ask for a drink refill until she was bringing the check.  Maybe they are always like that or maybe our waitress was having a personal issue day (it seemed like it), but the less than chipper attitude does not discourage me from coming back the next time I come to Las Vegas.  Definitly check this place out or their other location also in Las Vegas and one in San Diego."
4178,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We were there last Friday am. The wait for a table was not bad.  As we were seated, the waiter told us that the kitchen was a bit behind.  Coffee came quickly, but was not hot enough nor great coffee. The party next to us finally got their food and one of the gentlemen remarked ""wow, I feel like I've been here for a week"".  We also waited a long time for our food to arrive - over a half hour and our meals did not arrive at the same time. When the food came, the portion of potatoes was huge, but with not much flavor.  The scrambled egg portion was not huge and was also very bland. . The biscuit was very good and the waiter made a point to tell us that the jam was homemade with no preservatives.  It also did not have a lot of flavor.  The food also was not hot enough when it arrived. Anyway, portions are huge, in fact, too huge for most people.  I am sure a lot gets thrown out as none of us finished our meal. The food is very bland. They need to work on their quality, not their quantity.We didn't complain, but there are so many choices in Vegas - we won't be back."
4179,Hash House A Go Go,4,The portion sizes and taste of the food was good. The service and wait can be a little long so just be prepared. I had the banana French toast and the adobo hash with eggs both worth trying.
4180,Hash House A Go Go,5,Bit of a wait to get in but worth it.  If the possibility allows request that your sever is Gabby. She is phenomenal!  She had multiple tables on the rodeo weekend and did not miss a beat.  She is aware and extends the best customer service.
4181,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great portions, great food. Fun place!Portions are so big that you should consider sharing. One pancake will overfill your plate and is almost an 1"" thick. We also had the ham and spinach scrabble. Big chunks of ham. Came with a huge biscuit that my wife said was the best she's ever had."
4182,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place! The portions are CRAZY big and the bacon is fantastic. Oh and let's chat a minute about the French fries! Amazing! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are amazing!!!
4183,Hash House A Go Go,4,"How have I not known, until now, that this hidden gem existed??!! Located on the 2nd floor of the newly opened Quad Hotel Hash House A Go Go has been here for 6+ years back in the Imperial Palace hotel days... 
We showed up on a late Saturday morning and while the wait was long (about 40 minutes) the food and service was well worth every minute! Hash House has an extensive menu but we opted for two house favorites: Sage-fried chicken and waffles with fried leeks and upside down chicken pot pie. And talk about portions?! They are HUGE!!! It was quite entertaining to watch table after table be served their meals and to see the camera flash bulbs going off with people wanting to capture the artistry on their plate- me included. 
The sage-fried chicken and waffles with fried leeks was truly heaven on a plate! I have always wanted to try chicken and waffles and this was definitely the right place to be sucked into that world. The fried chicken was flavorful and juicy and the fried leeks?? Yes, I was skeptical about fried leeks but they were simply divine. They weren't overpowering and complimented the sage flavoring of the chicken breading well. 
The chicken pot pie was a marvel in its own right. Served with the crust on the side versus on the top/bottom allows you to enjoy every aspect of a chicken pot pie from the first bite to the last. 
Hash House is definitely a place to seek out and savor!"
4184,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The reality is the food here is pretty good. Solid Flavor. Generous portions. Creative plating and presentation.  The problem lies in the service here is not good.  Its a common theme in these reviews yet management doesnt seem to make changes.  

The Hostess isnt qualified to work at denny's.  The server was dry as hell. you have to walk down escalator to use washroom.  And they are slow.  We went at nite late when it was virtually dead.  Id say its safe to say coming heere for a weekend breakfast would be rolling the dice.

The concept here is good, the execution of management isnt.  Plus, walking into the Imperial Palace is depressing"
4185,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was very good, but the service was flat out horrible.  40 minutes to get our food and the beer that i ordered when i sat down.  The place wasnt all that busy either."
4186,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Large portions of equally large and tasty taste sensations.   Pancakes that are larger than the plate and thick and fluffy.  Chorizo hash with crispy potatoes was spicy, filling and delicious.  Blood Mary was a knock out!  Service was friendly and efficient but the kitchen seemed backed up.  Not the place for a quick bite.  But who wants to hurry through a meal this good!"
4187,Hash House A Go Go,4,"You can read all you want about the huge portion sizes but until you step foot inside the place you won't quite grasp it. 
I'm a big guy, and can scarf down a good size myself. Me and my table mate shared one plate and could barely finish it all. The table next to us each ordered separate items (one had pancake) and when they got up to leave it looked like an entire meal for two was still left.

The problem with many places like this is the size is their gimmick and the quality suffers. I will say the food quality could be better, but it was really about par or above par at what you'd find elsewhere on the strip (and considering the portion sizes, a lot more reasonable). A little dry here, a little bland there, but for the most part good stuff. 
The only real downer is the wait time. The food isn't quick to come out and so if you have to be somewhere, don't expect to walk right up get seated and out in an hour. It's not slow, just not fast food. For us this was fine, as we probably needed a break from gambling anyway. 

The staff is solid. They are busy so they might not always seem overly friendly. But they do answer questions thoroughly and check on you during the meal. 
Next trip in town I'll e back."
4188,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Diverse menu, friendly staff and busy atmosphere.

Go early, if party of two, sit at the bar - lots of good small talk and action going on. As well as delicious bloody mary's (they make their own mix and it shows).

Get the sage-fried chicken and whatever, this is the best, most moist chicken. Food portions are large and overeating is easy to achieve here.

It's crowded because it's an affordable and delicious breakfast spot. Get a bloody mary while you wait!"
4189,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food is really good.  I had a problem with the management.  I GET that it was New Year's Day and busy--totally understand.  However, we were put on the list at 2:10 pm with a quoted wait time of 30 minutes.  30 minutes go by so I go up to check on our status; just want to make sure we didn't miss our name being called. Hostess looks and has me come around to the ""que"" area. We proceed to stand in this area for another 30 minutes, listening for our name.  I go up again and I'm told our name was already called and we were seated.  Um, NO, obviously we are still standing here!  The wait list is on paper and there's no verification or confirmation of what party they are taking back to a table.  What about a buzzer like most restaurants?  Or a number like at a deli?  Or using software on an iPad?!  I assume the restaurant makes enough to afford an iPad or two.  What about the hostess being completely oblivious to the fact that the SAME 4 people have been standing there for quite some time--isn't that weird?  Why not inquire?   ""Hey, what's the name of your party again?""  It's not hard.  Lack of people skills and awareness at your job had me very disappointed and annoyed.  The solution is so simple."
4190,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Started off with a 25-30 minute wait which seemed normal, after we got seated the server greeted and took our drink order. Even though, the restaurant was super busy, I noticed the servers hustling. When we got our food, I asked my wife if the portions usually this big? And she stated yes, the portions are generous here. The atmosphere is great, they had sports playing on their TV's and the food is awesome. Will definitely come back when I come back to visit."
4191,Hash House A Go Go,5,Worth the wait. Plates are huge and so delicious. I recommend the biscuits and gravy egg meal. Big enough for two.
4192,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm going to save you some heartache here and tell you to visit with someone who likes to eat the same stuff as you, because you are asking for it if you order an entire entree to yourself. The portions here are made for the fat American tourist. 

Go for the chicken and waffles, or the chicken bendict. The bloody mary and mimosa are perfect for getting soaked up in all that food. Man, I really wish this place would wind up in Atlanta so I could stop saving the pennies from the couch cushions to get airfare back to Vegas for some Hash House."
4193,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Tried the sage chicken benedict, NOT AMAZING not even good.  Chicken bland, mash bland, biscuit dry, quantity with no quality.

Tried the meatloaf skillet, pretty good but potatoes were fried to shit.

also the $2.50 per extra plate does not make sense at all, why would you charge to grab a plate from the kitchen and bring it to the table.  I understand if you charge me to split my plate which requires work to split everything in half, but this is just an empty plate.  WACK!

OH ONE LAST THING, HASH HOUSE DOES NOT HAVE HASH BROWNS HAHAHA WACK!!"
4194,Hash House A Go Go,5,"They give you sooooo much food. The wait staff was excellent. Food tasted good. Not cheap,but worth it."
4195,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent service. Great food, good cup of coffee and the best damn Bloody Mary in Las Vegas!

I enjoy eating here every time I'm in Vegas. My husband loves the Fried Chicken and Waffle breakfast and my favorite is the Chorizo Hash and the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits.  Be warned: these PORTIONS ARE HUGE! You could easily share a meal, and because they have so many tasty options on the menu you could order several and share them so you can try a few dishes at a time. 

The fried chicken dinner and waffle meal comes with large, crispy, juicy chicken breasts and a hot belgian style waffle. The hash is served with home fries, eggs your way and chorizo-spicy but so good.  

The bloody mary is a perfect combination of all ingredients-not to tomatoey, with just enough citrus and heat to give your taste buds a kick and vodka to get 'cha mind right for a long, fun day in Vegas, lol.

The atmosphere is casual and fun, especially since they relocated from the M Resort to The Linq. It seems bigger, has a larger waiting area and bar inside, tvs all around in case there's a game on and they also have a great Bloody Mary bar at the entrance which I especially love. 

This is definitely someplace you should go eat if you're visiting Las Vegas at least once.  Im sure it'll become one of your favorites"
4196,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The epitome of a hearty meal.  Thick, smokey, and chunky, each satisfying bite takes you out of Vegas and back into your favorite diner... which for me is now Hash House.

Located next to the monorail entrance of Harrah's (up an escalator), and open 24 hours, there is no excuse not to pig out."
4197,Hash House A Go Go,5,We come here everytime we visit Las Vegas. Worth the wait everytime! My favorite is the corn beef hash but we've never had a bad meal. A place my whole family loves even the kids look forward to it!!!
4198,Hash House A Go Go,3,"PROS - LARGE portions, quick & friendly service ONCE SEATED, and LOVED the option to order mimosa's & bloody marys while you wait in the RIDICULOUSLY LONG line (BLOODY MARYS WERE TO DIE FOR!)

CONS - were told it would be a half hour wait - after waiting over an hour we discovered that their computer system went down & they had no idea when it would be up & running & they would not be seating anyone until it came back up. We left. Returned the next day because the hype was INSANE about this place. Got in after asn hour wait. Food was HUGE and yummy. Would I go again? Probably not - just because of the first days incident with the computers. HOW LONG would they left us wait had we not approached the counter regarding the wait time ?!?!"
4199,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It's quite unfortunate that this place is located inside Imperial Palace because, let's be real, Imperial Palace is JANK and you didn't go all the way to Vegas to spend time in there. However, our group was craving some hearty brunch food, so we decided to go here. In the middle of the casino floor, there's an escalator that leads exclusively to this restaurant. At the top, there's a waiting area and, further in, the actual restaurant.

We went around lunchtime and were told that it would be about a 30 minute wait. But luckily, a couple tables freed up earlier, and the hostess took us in halfway through our wait. We had to split up into two adjacent tables to go in earlier, but we didn't mind if it meant getting seated earlier.

Because I was so hungry, everything sounded so good and I had a hard time deciding what to get. I ultimately decided to get the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles since it was one of their special dishes. I also got the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade.
- Yes, the portions are large. My dish was definitely big enough for two. I guess it's kind of a novelty, but they must waste a lot of food here. Most people probably get their own dish and aren't able to finish, which of course means it gets dumped into the trash. I feel like it would be more economical for both parties if they served smaller portions and charged a little less.
- The Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles were good, though. The sage flavor took the chicken up a notch from being your standard fried chicken. The waffles were cooked perfectly, and the pieces of bacon embedded in the waffles added a nice dimension to them without overwhelming with bacon flavor. If you're a fan of chicken and waffles, I think this dish is worth a try.
- Definitely get the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade! It was delicious! And it's so pretty when it first comes out. :)

Something funny about this place... They stick a sprig (or a few) of rosemary into everything. Just look around. Everything has a long sprig of rosemary sticking out of it. They must have a big basket of them in the kitchen that every dish passes by...

Despite the food being pretty good, I didn't leave this place feeling particularly great. I think it was a combination of being OVERLY full and this place being inside Imperial Palace..."
4200,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love Hash House! It is by far the best breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas! The servers are outstanding- shout out to Gabby and Gary for the great service. Be prepared to wait but grab a Bloody Mary or tangerine mimosa and enjoy the people watching!
4201,Hash House A Go Go,3,Decent pancakes and food for the price.  More hype than I thought with the higher yelp ratings.  Nice people and service.  There is a line so go early....we got lucky and ate at the bar.
4202,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I don't normally give five stars unless everything was PERFECT, but I truly couldn't find a single thing to complain about! Service was great, burgers were huge and one of the best I've ever had! $14.95 for a gigantic burger and fries in LV is very affordable! To start, they brought out a big ol' biscuit with honey butter sauce on top that was incredible!! Not long after, our burgers came out. Water was always full, we sat down right away, and it was air conditioned!! Definitely recommend!!"
4203,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Enough has been said here, but seriously I don't even like bloody marys but I certainly did here.  Compared to anything else on the strip this place is several steps above for an amazing hangover cure be it food or otherwise."
4204,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is funky, divey, and loud. I picture people wanting to come here after a long night of indiscretions, drinks, and embarassment from making a fool of themselves the night(s) before. I was lucky because I was alone and walked right up to the bar and had a menu. I knew I would have terrible service for myriad reasons. I was alone, wasn't drinking alcohol, and am young. God forbid expectations for a high tipper being under 30. 

I ordered  the Sun dried tomato, basil, and goat cheese scrambler, the griddled potatoes (I still don't know exactly what they are besides delicious and not fried) with fruit. I wanted double fruit, but of course being alone, I wouldn't get any special request!

The food was fantasic, the service awful, and the crazy atmosphere was just what the doctor ordered. Why is a doctor ordering food?"
4205,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great staff!! It's seems like there's always at least a 30 min wait to be seated but the staff gets people in quickly (long lines=good food).

Our waitress was very helpful. She explained the menu and gave us recommendation on some of the more popular dishes and her personal favorites. 

The portions are very big so you will not be leaving hungry or unsatisfied. Everything is prepared fresh, starting with the freshly squeezed orange juice all the way down to the jam to put on your biscuits."
4206,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I specifically chose this location over the one inside Rio because of their 4 star reviews over 3 stars at Rio... Unfortunately, I'm only giving this place 3 stars because the service was pretty bad. 3 stars for their great menu with unique offerings (lots of breakfast items), huge portions, and ample seating. 

Value: since their portions are hugenormous, you can understand why they charge so much. However, $5.99 for hot chocolate, it's a bit overpriced. 

Taste: I only ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender meat inside- great! The taste- well, it's just ok. It can have a bit more flavor. The waffle is bacon infused. And since bacon makes everything better, I had no complaints there. The chicken is a bit over battered for my liking... Leaving fried batter all over the plate so on top of the thick bacon waffles, you have all this breading from the chicken--- carbs anyone???

Service: here's why i deducted 2 points... The bf ordered espresso... Accidentally, upon setting the cup on the table, the server spilled the espresso on the table, my seat, pants, and sleeves. We all know how small an espresso is so with half of it gone, he barely had any. You would think he would offer to replace it, nope! Fine. We realized our server clearly do not care about beverage because we already had our food and the water never came. Tending to our hydration needs seemed such an abhorrent task for him. The server gave no apologies, no f*ck, nor two sh!ts 

Finale: this place is overrated. Their food presentation is impressive however the taste does not match its aesthetics. What can I say, I'm a professional complainer and an emotional eater. Eating is an experience for me. To me, this was not a good one."
4207,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Breakfast drunchies? Yes please. HUGE HUGE portions. The Fried chicken is amazing but wow the portion could feed 3. Don't be bashful and just order 1 plate to split amongst 3 people.

The chorizo hash is amazing and not on the late night menu, but you might be able to request it anyway."
4208,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Very disappointed. Perhaps going to the original location would have fared better. We had the chicken and waffles. Waffles were not crispy yet the syrup was only at the top most layer. Chicken was bland in taste as well.  I also tasted a scramble. For a restaurant that prides itself on large portions, the scramble was a small plate half the plate was potatoes. The biscuits were easily the best part of the meal."
4209,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We rode the bus from Tropicana to the Quad to go there, and it was worth it!

The prices are very reasonable for a breakfast in Vegas, especially considering the portions. If, as some reviewers mentioned, you don't like getting so much food or it's too much of a carb-bomb for you, then don't eat all of it! The last thing I'd complain about on the verge of a hangover on the expensive Vegas strip is that they gave me too much food. 

I got the sage chicken biscuits and gravy. It was enormous and really tasty. The best thing about it was the creamy sauce that I suppose was meant to be the gravy. The big biscuits are nice and fluffy inside. They were best with the homemade strawberry jam. 

The service was friendly but a little slow. Quite forgivable, since their s'mores mocha takes the server maybe 12 steps to make and seems to involve an acetylene torch.

(FYI, it's a bit of a maze to get there from the street, especially with construction going on in the hotel. )

This place has a quirky, fun character. I'm really glad I found it. It will definitely be part of my regular Vegas routine."
4210,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First things first... portions are HUGE.  No really.. huge-er than huge.   Find a friend at your table and share or pick something you might want to eat again for the next two days. 

Yummy comfort food, casual setting and decent service gives this place high marks for me.  Our party of 8 was hungry and more than ready for dinner... we were seated pretty quickly and our waitress was quick to greet us.  They offered a good HH deal on wine and the menu offers so many choices - healthy eaters and indulgers will both enjoy.  On our way to the table we spotted the entrees and that quickly made our decision to share meals!  Table favorites were sage fried chicken & waffles (PS two hungry boys shared this and were completely satisfied and full!), the burgers and the kokokmo sandwich. I especially like the fries - hot, salty and crispy. Not sure I would rush back next time I am in Vegas but definitely a good spot to grab dinner (or brunch I hear), especially if you are looking to soak up some of the Vegas alcohol.  They were great with our large party and with no reservation - bonus!"
4211,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I came here for brunch on my last day in Vegas. My friend and I shared the house hash with chorizo, jalapenos, cheddar cheese & fresh tomato. We also shared ONE Snickers flapjack with two other girls.

The hash was delicious! Very well flavored and huge portion size (definitely enough for two people!). But speaking of portion size, the Snickers flapjack was RIDICULOUS! It was about the size of a large pizza... among the 4 of us, we managed to eat maybe 2/3rds of it. Definitely unique! :)

One thing I do have to comment on is that the waiter service was incredibly slow... maybe they were just having a really busy day, but our server almost never came around.

-L."
4212,Hash House A Go Go,1,"OK...are all of these reviews fake or what??? This has got to be some of the nastiest food I have ever had in my entire life!! This place is beyond overrated and the service simply sucked (almost had to knock a waitress out) . My hubby and I were here over Labor Day weekend and the wait was not that bad only 10 minutes or so. While we were waiting the hostess called the name ""Tasha"" several times looking at me as if that were my name. I guess she must have thought all black girls go by the name of Tasha. That should have been a sign of what was to come. Once they called my husbands name (Scott not Tasha) we go and get seated. Some dumb pierced up airhead was our waitress. I asked her what was the best thing on the menu she suggested the chicken and waffles and then she goes into describing to me what a waffle is. Like.. OK. I noticed how big the portions were by looking at the patron's plates and I told her that my husband and I would like to share the entree. She then goes into telling me about the split fee. Which I didn't mind paying but she thought that was a big deal. After she gave us the split fee speech she went away. About 10-15 minutes later she brings my guy some mango iced tea which tasted like toilet water. While trying to flag down the waitress the bartender noticed that we had been flagging our waitress down for several minutes. The bartender then comes to our table and apologizes and brings my guy out a Sprite. About 10 minutes later some dude comes out with our plate of food. Which by appearence looked really tasty. Let me tell u this looks are very, very deceiving. The chicken was like cardboard dry and the waffles were even drier than the chicken. I tried to flag down the waitress again for a side of butter and syrup just so I could try to flavor this food up. She never came but the bartender came to her rescue and brought out some butter. The waitress then came by the table and I asked her for a side of syrup which she never brought out. After trying again to eat the cardboard disguised as food we realized that it wasn't even worth waiting for the syrup we tried flagging down the waitress again. This time she comes by the table with a major attitude. Since I could sense her attitude I asked her politely if we could order something else because our meal was not edible. She then throws a menu at me and states""what do you want"". I was like taken back by her attitude and told her to ""take this $hit"" (the nasty food). I then tell my husband that I can't deal with this ghetto a$$ place anymore and I leave. My husband stays upstairs and is forced to pay for cardboard food that we didn't even eat. Unless you are used to eating cardboard and drinking toilet water, I would not suggest u to EVER go to this hell hole. Hash House A Go Go needs to go Hash House a Bye Bye!! EPIC FAIL!!!!"
4213,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It's a pretty decent place to eat.

I wasn't a huge fan with the food I order (I actually forget the name of it!), but that doesn't mean anything else was on par with that. I was with a large group of people who all seemed to enjoy their food, so maybe I just made the wrong choice!

The service is great, even though it was so busy! Our server was very polite and patient, and we had a rather... ahem, difficult customer to please in our group."
4214,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I had no choice but to try Hash House A Go Go.  My co-worker highly recommended this place and it had pretty good reviews from my Yelp friends.  The family and I arrived at noontime on a Saturday where we were met by a long wait. We waited along with the masses in the front of the restaurant listening to the woman call out garbled sounding numbers over their PA system until it seemed close to our turn.  When it seemed close to our turn, I had to go up to the front to ask her what number she just called.  Tired of seeing my face, they finally called out my number and sat the family and I in the back corner of the restaurant.

We sat there perusing the menu.  Google Hangout messages were sent by my friends who told me that I needed order their Corned Beef Hash and their Chicken and waffles.  We were all ready to order.  Missing was our waiter.  We kept looking at the wait staff, but, none of them stopped at our table.  We didn't know if we had a waiter or a waitress.  Then I saw a nicely dressed man getting drinks for a table that was close to ours, and I heard the table behind me grumbling about the waiter not being there to deliver their check so that they could leave.  We were already seated for 20 minutes.  We needed to go home, back to Los Angeles.  So, I flagged down the nicely dressed man and asked him about our nonexistent waiter.  After a little bit of chit chat, we gave the nicely dressed man our order.  It wasn't until half an hour later that our waiter finally showed up and introduced himself.  Too late...your manager had already taken our order.  

The food was good.  The portions were big and could have been easily shared by two people.  The Corned Beef Hash came on a skillet with lots of cheese, corned beef on top of potatoes, an egg, and a biscuit.  It was good.  Even my daughter who doesn't like to eat meat liked it.  The Chicken and waffles was impressive.  The fried chicken came in a tower held in place by a knife. The chicken was flavorful and moist.  It was a winner.

The nicely dressed man, the manager came back to check on us.  Like the tables around us, he gave us a 25% discount.  The waiter finally showed up at the end, perhaps he was expecting some kind of tip.  Good food, but, nonexistent waiter.  I might've given them more stars if the waiter showed up."
4215,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was very good, the service super friendly. The portions, however, are embarrassingly large. My husband and I split the chicken and waffles (so frickin' delish) and an order of French toast and ate barely 25% of it. Plan accordingly so you don't waste so much food or money."
4216,Hash House A Go Go,4,Yummy yummy lol food was good! I had the French toast and it was good with bacon and eggs only thing I didn't care for was the banana peel on top. I would be back. Try something different. Portions are huge enough to share between two people.
4217,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great service by Mae.    She was so polite and friendly with quick accurate service.   Great food too!!
4218,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hash house a go go is the place to eat after a night out on the strip. Bloody Mary's are home made from scratch and the chicken and waffles is to die for
4219,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is AMAZINGGGG! Everything is huge and delicious. It was so good I ate here twice in one weekend. 

My boyfriend and I had the fried chicken Benedict and the brown sugar & banana pancake. The Benedict was a mountain of scrumptious chicken, mashed potatoes, eggs and sauce. It was waaaaay to much food for two people but we couldn't stop eating it. The pancake (also huge) was recommended to us by our server and I am so glad we listened. It was perfectly sweet and caramelized. The banana was not over powering at all, perfectly complemented by the syrup. 

Overall, this place is amazing and delicious. If you're super hungry and looking for delicious food, this is the way to go!"
4220,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Really good when you feel like splurging and gorging yourself. Lol. The biggest servings of crazy concoctions, don't ask about calories or fat content. Better suited for those with a gall bladder."
4221,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I did a search on Yelp last week about the best breakfast in Vegas and this place came up. Since it was located next door to my hotel we were eager to try it. 

Thursday morning - line out the door, so we skipped it
Saturday morning - line down the stairs, so we skipped it
Monday morning - line out the door, but decided to stay.  The line moved surprisingly quick. 

There were 4 of us at the table and the server was really great. I asked her what she recommended and she went through some things and gave great input. She even suggested that each couple could split a meal and there would be plenty of food to spare. 

But being the gluttons we are, we wanted to try many things so we each ordered something different. What ensued was maybe the best breakfast I've ever had. Everybody loved everything and there was indeed too much food, but it was worth it. 

I also feel it's one of the finer values on the Strip as far as cost. ~$15pp for the best breakfast you're likely to ever have is a bargain"
4222,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The name fooled us at first. Thought this place was a Las Vegas Hookah bar. Then we met a local who highly recommended this place so we went there for Chicken and waffles.  Bacon in the waffles. Yum!  Best ever!  Happy hour only applies to the bar seats and you can't walk up and order at the bar to get that special either.  Still, the one platter of food is enough for two. Service was not speedy but didn't deter a great time."
4223,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'm not sure I 100% get the hype surrounding this place, but I do think that this place is quite a bit of fun.

Even though the greeter was this super sullen looking woman (maybe this is just how it is, living in Las Vegas), most of the staff seemed pretty cheerful working here. We were here probably by about 7:00 am in the morning, and by the time we left this place was almost full, so you may want to consider coming here at an off hour. This place seems to be popular mainly because they are open 24 hours for the hardcore gamblers of this city.

My friend opted for the sage chicken, and I got the bacon waffle. Both orders were super large, but the sage chicken was kind of in a league of its own. It cost about $18, but the order probably lasted my friend for 3 meals-ish, since he wound up taking leftovers to go and didn't finish it off until the next day. It's a combination of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, some fruit, and a whole concoction of other weird things. Frankly, it didn't look all that great to me, but it was really a huge amount of food for a reasonable price.

My order, the bacon waffle, was pretty good. I don't typically have much success at home when I try to cook bacon into pancakes or waffles, so I was impressed by how well they manage to combine the bacon into my waffle. The order, while not as humongous as the sage chicken, was quite large, and I wasn't able to finish the thing in one sitting. It was paired with reasonably high quality syrup and butter, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I think they hash house is more of a gimmick restaurant rather than an actual destination spot, but it's definitely worth it to go at least once. Again, the 24 hour aspect is a great feature. 

It's worth it to note that the temperature in this dining space is SUPER cold. I would strongly recommend bringing a sweater or something, since they keep this restaurant extremely chilly. I don't get the logic for this."
4224,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Two stars, only because the Manager was absolutely awesome accommodating my 5 person party despite a mishap. Otherwise, I would have given one star...the minimum needed to leave a review! The food was absolutely HORRIBLE! You know the expression, ""I wouldn't feed this to my dog?"" Yeah well, I wouldn't! And if I did, I wouldn't expect a lesser punishment than being convicted of animal cruelty! They even tried to compensate for the bad food by putting enough on your plate to feed animals in the Jurassic Era! I'm going to put that two spoon bite experience in the recesses of my mind and hope it never surfaces as a severe stroke, seizure or psychotic break! This place is GARBAGE!"
4225,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Lovee this place!!! I had the Chicken Hash and Eggs Benedict, yuuuumy!! I couldn't get enough I went two days in a row and got the same thing. Large portions! My husband and I couldn't even finish it together. Great customer service!"
4226,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I was in Las Vegas for a company function and had heard and read about the reviews for this place. I was eagerly anticipating my visit and even had spoken with my colleagues about going. We were staying at the Flamingo so the location was ideal for us to visit for breakfast. There were 12 of us that went in and when told it was a 40 minute wait 8 decided to go elsewhere. The remaining 4 decided we would wait; you only get to Vegas so often; right? We waited for 40 minutes and we were finally seated. Everything is okay so far. The menu looked fantastic and I had already made up my mind I was having the chicken and waffles. I could not wait!! We ordered coffees and water and then our meals. The menu states clearly ""please be patient, everything is made from scratch and can take time to prepare""; I am more than okay with this. I am willing to wait for fabulous, fresh food. This is where things began to deteriorate rapidly. Our waitress while bubbly was inattentive or inefficient at her occupation or both. We asked for refills on coffee; after waiting for 10 mins for her to notice we needed more. She said that she had some brewing. Okay, no problem. Two seconds later my wife notices other servers pouring coffee for their customers. After another 5 mins we wave her down again and ask for more coffee. She says ""sure!"" as if the previous request never happened. Several minutes later the coffee finally came. Water glasses were never refilled without having to track someone down and ask. Same with the coffee. This went on for 40-45 mins while waiting for food. The food finally started to come out. First was my wife's pancake. A couple of minutes later the french toast came out for one of us and then a few minutes later the BLT that was ordered; sans the fries. Then a few minutes after that my chicken and waffles came out. Now as I stated I am cool with the 40 minute wait for fresh food; but in that time frame you should be able to get an entire table of four all served at the same time. So, we all start to dig in. My wife's pancake is huge and looks great. They gave her a thimble full of syrup for a pancake that is the size of Texas. No problem; just ask for more. We had to ask again after it never came. My dining companions were enjoying the french toast and the BLT. Still no fries. I was taking on the chicken and waffles. They did not come with any syrup. They did come with a ""maple reduction sauce"" unfortunately it was reduced to nothing. The waffles were good and had bacon in the middle but they were dry without the necessary syrup to get them down. Asked for syrup again. Waited. It finally came. My friend was done with the BLT. No fries...asked for them and they finally came out. Asked for more coffee and water. Waited. Finally got it. So as you can imagine our table discussion this entire time has been how disappointed we all have been with our experience. My friend Mark finally asked for the manager and voiced his concerns with our experience. The manager apologized and left. A few minutes later Mark caught him again and asked for his business card and said ""I'm a letter writer"". The manager gave him the card and then came back to the table and took his BLT and the drinks off of the bill. Smart move. Took a little prodding but it was a smart move. We could not wait to pay and get out. I would not make the effort to go back. My new name for this place is ""Hash House A No Go"" and I will leave it at that. Good day now!"
4227,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing!!!  Food is fresh and delish.. Prices are very reasonable.. Staff was very friendly and prompt.. Couldn't ask for better service.
4228,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Wait wasn't bad, food wait wasn't terrible. What was terrible was the food. Bland, no flavor. The portions are well siZed, probably only reason this place gets any attention. There are far better options available"
4229,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Staff was great, chicken and waffles not to good, chicken has little flavor and waffles are average.  Great presentation, a classic fried chicken batter may add a lot to this."
4230,Hash House A Go Go,1,Waited 45min for a table with half the place empty and then when finally sat no one came to our table for 20 min plus....we had to get up and leave! Really if you are too busy and under staffed just say so and don't waste my time!
4231,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The location is right in the middle of the Lynq casino. So first impression was with the hoste. It was not the warmest greeting and it seem like it bothered him to take my name and number of party down. Asked for a menu to look at while we wait and again he seemed bothered. Don't know if he was having a bad day or what. 

The wait time was not long at all and greeted warm by the lady who sat us. 

Our waiter cane right away and explain all about the menu being that it was our first time. My date is vegan and the waiter was great at putting something together for her and to accommodate her meal. As for me I ordered the eggs benedict to see what the rage was about. Let me tell you it did. The plate was a mountain of food. I was not able to finish it and I have finished 32 pancakes at one sitting. The tasted great. The only thing was the chicken a little dry. Other than that I recommended it but get ready to share it. It is more a meal for two. 

Over all I enjoy my experience here other than the host I think you would like it."
4232,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I think this place may be a little overhyped b/c of the ginormous portion sizes and previous appearance on Man vs Food. The dining room is not very large and the tables/chairs are old and wobbly. The waitress wasn't bad, but not good either. I barely saw her at all. Once we were finally seated, it took what seemed liked forever to get our gigantic meals. I was almost embarrassed after ordering the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I mean it really is ridiculously large. There is no way the normal person is going to eat it all- and its unlikely that you will be taking home leftovers in Vegas if you're staying at a nice hotel. There is so much going on here, fried chicken, sage, salsa, mashed potatoes, biscuit, eggs, bacon, corn, sauce. Way too many flavors, way too salty and just not that great. By the time I decided I was going to explode, it didn't look like I had eaten anything...just made a toddler mess on my plate. LOL

My husband got the waffle which was also large, but extremely dry. Even a with a whole cup of syrup on it, you had to chew it a million times to help it slide down. Whew! 

Try it to say you tried it or save your money and go elsewhere."
4233,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great place! We went there for breakfast. The food is amazing and most of the dishes come in huge portions. We ordered 4 dishes for 8 of us and we still had leftovers. The food was delicious! Service was excellent.  Must try!
4234,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had brunch here last weekend at the request of one of my friends. All she wanted to do while in Vegas was come here and have the fried chicken & biscuit benedict. Thank goodness this place was on her to do. Our brunch was delicious. If you love comfort food as much as I do, then this place should be put on your Vegas restaurant list. Yes, it's in the Imperial Palace and I understand your hesitation but just close your eyes and run through the casino and you will arrive shortly and safely at Hash house.  The portions were huge and we probably shouldn't have ordered a plate each but everything sounded like it was a must eat. 
The prices are low considering the amount of food they give you. Their coffee was probably some of the best American coffee I have ever had. The griddled french toast with grilled bananas and cinnamon cream was absolutely perfect.. The fried chicken and bacon waffles I could've done without. And finally I am still dreaming of the  farm benedict. Their sage fried chicken w/ spinach, bacon, tomato, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs was the ultimate morning comfort food. 
I so wish we had this restaurant in Miami. Until I go back to Vegas I'll try to recreate it in Miami so I can kill my craving."
4235,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions are huge, great for a night after drinking with friends! Chicken and waffles will feed your whole family! The service was friendly and helpful!"
4236,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awsome place. Very good food. Everyone is nice and accomodating. Took a little while to sit as we had a bigger group but eric was very good server!!! Highly recommended!!
4237,Hash House A Go Go,1,Portions were so HUGE I felt myself getting fatter just watching to food go by. we shared a breakfast corned beef & hash and it was just ok. I am a quality over quantity kind of person but if you want to eat A LOT of food with mediocre flavor then go here!
4238,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Chicken and waffles... Always one of my favorite.  Granted it costs $23, but I usually have it for at least 2, sometimes even 3 meals, so it works out to be a pretty good deal, specially for the Strip.  Also, the 24 hours is clutch... Nothing like a wasted 4AM chicken and waffles to make you feel like crap in the morning :)"
4239,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Bring your appetite because you will definitely need it if you come here. I ordered a salad and the chicken and waffles. The salad was overly drenched in dressing. Ask for the dressing on the side if you don't like your lettuce soggy.

The biscuits were good. They were covered in honey butter and were the size of my fist. But....I'll admit they are nothing compared to the biscuits at Sweet Cheeks Q in Boston. 

By the the time I got through the salad and half of the biscuit the chicken and waffles was served. Holy... The waffles are made with bacon inside! Um, who was the genius who thought of that? This portion washuge and could definitely feed 2 people. 

Overall it was a decent meal and I had plenty of leftovers."
4240,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Not sure what people were expecting, based on some of these reviews, but we got exactly what we came for. Breakfast should be the biggest meal of the day, correct? Hash House did not disappoint. Okay, it's not easy to find, but if you ask someone in the casino, they'll stop you before you get Hash out of your mouth, and get you right there. Yes, the casino is smoky. Yes, that can drift up to the restaurant. And yeah, it's dark and loud. Is ambiance really why you're looking for at breakfast? Not me. 
The food... Delicious. I had the save chicken Benedict, and it was nothing short of breakfast heaven. Advice I received from our server, start from the top. Very wise move. The biscuit is THICK, and the potatoes are decadent. 
Somehow, the chicken stays crisp, even in that sauce, which by the way is perfect for the dish. Even the bacon stays crisp. 
I highly recommend. And if a classic, hearty if not excessive, breakfast is what you crave, this is the spot."
4241,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hits and misses for an all around decent dining experience on the strip. Tried the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Tractor Breakfast, and Steak & Eggs. From those three, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles was the winner. What brought down this rating was the customer service and the other two ordered items. Let me first start off with the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. This dish was solid and plenty big. Consider sharing it. The fried chicken was very moist and tender. The crust on the chicken was sweet and very crispy. The waffles were toasty and crispy. Add some syrup and you're good to go. They put a lot of thought into this dish, so consider checking this place out simply for this one dish. 

I ordered the Tractor Breakfast with one stack, two over-medium eggs, and bacon. The pancake stack was extremely large. Again, consider sharing this dish if you're a light eater. I found the pancake to be too thick and dense. It's okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again. The over-medium eggs were cooked appropriately and the bacon was a bit too dry for my liking. Size wins, but food taste was mediocre.

The Steak and Eggs was a loser. Low quality beef and lots of unnecessary garnishes like tomato, oranges, and rosemary. Who care about garnishes when you're ordering steak and eggs? I found the steak to be dry and quality that you find at a dive diner. 

Customer service was spotty. It took forever to get our server's attention. Plus, she wasn't very informative on explaining what we ordered. 

In sum, diner experience with strip prices."
4242,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Sweet baby Jeebus! Have you seen their portion sizes???????

I will say that again.

SWEET BABY JEEBUS! Portions! OMG! FRICKIN' HUGE!

Okay, I think that about covers it for this review. My work here is done. Moving on....

Oh, you want more? Okay, my brother-in-law saw this on Man Vs. Food and insisted that we try it. And we did. And there is no way on earth any mere mortal can finish a Hash House A Go Go portion. The Husband ate about a quarter (and that's being generous) of his chicken and waffles. I ate about an eighth of a meatloaf sandwich that would feed a small Bavarian village. I mean, I required a small crane to lift the thing. My jaw snapped trying to get an actual bite. 

The food is tasty comfort food, served large and proud. It's not haut cuisine, but they do enough inventive things with it to make it memorable for more than just size. I kept purloining The Husband's waffles and dipping them in whatever sauce they served it with. 

They will charge some kind of surcharge if you share a plate, but you probably shouldn't let that stop you if you think you can both settle on a dish to share. It might be best, because there is no other way you will have room for dessert there, and I did want to see if the dessert was as mammoth as everything else."
4243,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Solid 3 star review for the Hash House at the Linq.

Went over on a Sunday and place was packed, waited approximately 30-45 minutes to be  seated which is perfectly fine as it is a famous place (thanks Adam!) on the Strip. I should have googled more and found the other ones off the strip in order to be able to get a location with perhaps less people.

Anyway, after the long wait we were seated and waited 10-20 minutes for a server to show up. Ordered and was told the meal was going to take a while (which it did) but it would have been nice to at least get the Pepsi I ordered (never did) however it was charged.

Though the place was packed I expected a bit more attention from the server than just come take the order, drop off order, drop check, take check...yes, she came in and asked as usual if ""everything is ok?"" but it seemed like the attention was not there...perhaps too few servers in a crowded weekend.

As far as the food...it was good quality, and the value was there. Ran out of ketchup but server was not around to ask for more....and seriously, who charges for ranch?

Will I go there again? I guess if I need my fix but it's too much of a name that it will get full so if you are expecting to enjoy your meal without a rush, perhaps this isn't the place."
4244,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I frequent Vegas and I find that mid-strip there aren't many places to go for a brunch/breakfast. I have been to the standard places and there are the fast food joints, but I have always been a little stuck for brunch because I'm not a huge buffet person. 

Well, look no further, mid-strip patrons! I have found the answer. So, I have to say that I was a bit intimidated by the wait (there seemed to be 50+ people standing around) but they said 25 mins for 2, so we figured that's ok. My second turn off was the ""Pancake house"" loudspeaker system which they yell your name when your table is ready. I don't know. Just not my favorite thing. 

However, look past the crowd, and the loudspeaker and you will be pleasantly surprised by the food. The portions are huge. If you have a fridge in your room, bring them back for your 2am hunger. 

I ordered the Hash House Meatloaf, spinach, roasted peppers and smoked mozzarella hash. Amazing. The meatloaf was perfectly seasoned - not too sweet, not too salty, and good consistency, and the spinach, peppers and mozzarealla made it amazing. The portion - like I said, was huge. I would definitely get it again, but with the menu selection, there is so much to try that I might be tempted by something else as well. 

So overall, try it out! I will be back. It's worth the wait."
4245,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went on a Tuesday night after a concert, around 11:30 pm. It was super fast to get seated and get our foods. Our waitress was particularly friendly, and came back just enough time to keep our glasses full and make sure we were satisfied. I had the massive mushroom burger, 2 patties! It was delicious. The fries are seasoned, and they have a little kick to em. My friend had the avocado bacon burger and she loved it. The portions are huge, so we ended up taking half of it back to the hotel with us. Totally affordable, too, especially as a restaurant along the strip."
4246,Hash House A Go Go,4,HUGE portions and the wait was ridiculous but the foo dis made to order so you can't go wrong there. Had the Man vs Food plate & it was great!
4247,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Honest review.. this is based on me and my wife's experience.

Overall experience of the restaurant was nice. Employees were nice,  ambiance was great. The look and feel really makes it a hot tourist stop.

I ordered the spinach scamble with the pancake on the side. So when I ordered the pancake, I was skeptical about the pancake size. It is truly big, whole platter plate big. But that's it. It's just big. It's dense, dry, sinks in the middle and butter did nothing for the pancake. The pancake just keeps hype cuz of how big it is but it isn't tasty. Terrible batter. I can't say anymore negative about the pancake. The scramble tho, was hella good.. that save the meal for me.

My wife order the the combo that comes with the pancake. It's two eggs and choice of sausage or bacon. Her pancake was the same and the eggs didn't look like two. The eggs were so small, it shouldn't be there. Her sausage was greasy and small.  They just get by with the looks.  

Some other positive is that others at our table had the vanilla waffle , and that thing was amazing. Nice size, soft, just amazing. They should market this more than the pancake."
4248,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I think this restaurant was the first one I bookmarked for our trip to Vegas. Huge portions, crazy menu, sold. The fact that we didn't have to travel off the strip to eat at it, was even better.

We made the epic trip down the strip to find this location. There seemed to be a huge lineup of people waiting for tables but we were told around 40 minutes for a table of 4. You're given your little buzzer (that doesn't work down on the casino floor) and then you wait. They both scream out your name and collect your buzzer, and if you're not there when they do so, off the list you go. Our wait was around that time but when it's 2pm and this is your breakfast, that time seems like an eternity.

Service was quite sparse, though our waiter was very nice. We placed our order for drinks and two came out right away, and the other two (bar beverages) took about 15 minutes. 15 minutes for a bottled beer and a margarita. Then we waited for our food and it must have taken close to an hour. The menu says that it make take a little while but after the wait for the table, this was a lot.

I got a burger, stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, and a side salad. The burgers are huge and very messy to eat. Have lots of napkins! The meat isn't seasoned and so really it's just a very big average burger. The dressing on the salad was delicious and I think that was my favorite part of the meal.

The other meals at the table were fine but nothing was seasoned very well and it was all kinda meh. Portions are unnecessarily huge and they'll gladly box your leftovers up for you. Again, it took a long time for the bill to come and so by the time we left, it was after 4pm.

If you want to feed a family of 4 with one plate of food, this is your place. Prices are very reasonable but try to hit them at a slow time and be prepared to wait a long time for your food."
4249,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I don't know why I tortured myself with trying this place again. Service was polite and attentive but the food tasted like it had been precooked and thrown on the plate. 
The hot chocolate is big and tasty, certainly better than the food. We never come back, if rather drive to another hotel or go to ihop!"
4250,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've never been treated with such hospitality in Vegas! 

When we first arrived they told us it was an hour and twenty minute wait, no big deal! They offered us a bloody marry or if we'd like something else we could walk back to the bar and get it there. 

GO TO THE BAR!! I can't stress this enough! 

We walked up and the lady sitting next to where we were standing  said ""You should take a seat! It's first come first serve back here."" Both of us were feeling a little  thrown off since we'd just been told we had a little over an hour to wait but... sure enough the bar tender asked what she could get us to drink and took our names off the list! 

We had our food in twenty minutes:)

The food was delicious! We got the sage fried chicken and waffles, the sage friend chicken benedict, cinnamon late, and two bud lights.  The total only came to about $46.00 + a tip. 

In my opinion that's pretty cheap for Vegas and the amount of food they give you.

We will most definitely be back!"
4251,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House is famous for their comically large portions. We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was packed and the wait time was over an hour. 

Once we were seated, that was when the real wait began. We knew right away what we wanted, since we were staring at the big menu in the waiting area. We split the house smoked salmon benedict and the Snickers pancake, which also came with two eggs. 

Dining at this location is an exercise in patience. We witnessed several impatient parties around us. Our favorite was the hangry lady who complained about the pancake being so large that it was touched the table. The food took almost an hour to get to us. There was no secret why this happened. Scratch-made, slow food takes time and the restaurant was busting at the seams with diners. 

For the amount of volume they experienced that morning, there was no compromise on the quality or taste. Our snickers pancake drooped over the side and touched the table, which I was fully anticipating. My inner fat kid kicked my inner germaphobe in the gut, before going to town on the oversized hotcake. The cakes were fluffy enough to support the chunks of candy. The sugars from the chocolate and nougat caramelized and were ooey and gooey. The side of over easy eggs looked silly in comparison. Everything smelled delicious and we were making the other tables still waiting for their meals jealous. The salmon serving was generous. It was flaky and moist and doused in hollandaise. The biscuit was tender and flaky and absorbed all the flavors cascading from above. 

This was a great dining experience, but it was our first and last visit to this location since learning about the one a couple miles off-strip."
4252,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Large portions - come with an appetite or plan on sharing. Stopped in for breakfast around 8am on a weekday thus beating the wait. Atmosphere was cold, no windows. Server was pleasant- food was decent. Ordered the chorizo jalapeÃ±o hash, which had far more potatoes than meat. It would have been nice to have more meat to accompany the mounds of leftover potatoes. The hash meal was served in a cast iron skillet, but the restaurant did not use that to their advantage as the food was warm, but not hot. It would have been better to serving the food a hot cast iron skillet."
4253,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I love benedicts and I was craving a good been- I read some Yelp reviews and found Hash House A Go Go and decided that would be my breakfast place. I also looked online and the menu seemed delicious and I love fresh, organic and farm food. I ordered the HH Original benedict. I knew I would miss my hollandaise sauce but the roasted cream sauce sounded interesting. The service was great and the food comes out super fast. It was huge to my surprise. It was pretty bland to me and what makes it huge is the super enormous scoops of mashed potatoes and two fluffy biscuits. It's a total carbohydrate nightmare. I ate the sauce and the eggs and a few bites of potato with biscuit. But I still craved my traditional benedict that I originally had my heart set on. I should have ordered a scramble instead because there is a lack of protein in this dish. 
This is in the Quad Casino and there is a lot of construction going on in the casino so it can be hard to find - just follow the signs or ask someone. 
If you like carbs- then you will probably like Hash House A Go Go. This place will make you fat."
4254,Hash House A Go Go,5,OMG - this is a Vegas must.  We were overwhelmed by the menu options but quickly elected the chicken and waffles after seeing it delivered to our neighbors table.  Clearly an order is a meal filling for two and at 18.00 is well worth the cost.  There is an amazing and creative list of specialty drinks which were all worthy of trying.  It took us very long to opine the drink menu and decide on a mimosa.  The service was exceptional; out waitress made great recommendations and provided excellent follow up.  It's well worth the wait.  Out your name in enjoy a little casino time and wait for an amazing meal that will wow your taste buds.
4255,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really really big servings, so make sure you come hungry. 

Service can be a little slow, but maybe that's how they work up your appetite. 

I got the fried chicken salad (yup I'm an oxymoron), omg the fried chicken was the best I've ever had.  I'm usually not a fan of fried chicken breast, but man this place prepared it so tender and juicy I'm drooling just thinking about it again. 

The fiancÃ© got the grilled chicken hash which looked really good, but again, huge!

Other things ordered at my table were the sage chicken and waffle, the cornbread, a scramble, and a hash with sausage and asparagus... Everyone left happy :)"
4256,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My wife and I came here with some friends on a Saturday morning and the place was full. We waited 45 minutes to get a table. While we waited we looked at the menu so by the time we got to our table we new what to order, this helped speed things up LOL! When we got our food we couldn't believe the size of the portions and how everything looked different but tasty. My wife got the famous chicken and waffles, I got the roasted red pepper & griddled smoked mozzarella burger. They were both bomb!! After taking the first bite it makes you forget the long wait and it makes it all worth it. 

Believe the hype, this is definitely a must try!"
4257,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place for the first time. We decided to split the chicken and waffles plate since the portions are soo large and let me tell you the. Chicken was sooo tender and the bacon waffles were so tasty too.There was lots of people waiting to get seated but it went really fast and the service was quick and friendly.We also tried the watermelon lemonade and its was very tasty and not too sweet!
I highly recommend this place and cant wait to go back."
4258,Hash House A Go Go,4,Some people take the farm to table concept more seriously than others. This is one of those places. You generously are given a full sprig of Rosemary with every dish! And the portions are huge so share a single entree!
4259,Hash House A Go Go,5,Their Sage Chicken and Waffle is an absolute try. Feels like the owner of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffle went through the most elite culinary training and re-made that staple into something amazing. The quality and taste are spectacular. The orange juice is freshly squeezed from oranges as well.
4260,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I took my mom here for brunch when she was visiting from out of town.  We had a good experience, the service was great and our waiter was very friendly! Our waiter warned us that the portion sizes were huge, so my Mom and I ordered a scramble and pancakes and I opted to make the biscuit that came with into a biscuit and gravy...  we were able to try a variety of items and still have food left over.  Overall definitely enjoyed the experience and the food was great and we had fun!"
4261,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Just to clarify, we asked for the chair to be moved to the COUNTER where the person in our party was ALLOWED to STAND, ORDER and EAT his meal. It was NOT an emergency exit.  However, had it been an emergency exit the reply from management would've been totally understandable."
4262,Hash House A Go Go,4,Came here on a Sunday around 11:30am with my mom. They quoted us about 45 minutes to an hour for a table but we got in in about 30 minutes. While you're waiting you can always go downstairs and check out the [smaller sized] casino. We split the chicken and waffles and it was huge. I ate 1 waffle and half of one chicken breast and was done. The couple next to use had the pork/ham benedict and it was ginormous. The chicken could have been seasoned a little bit differently but it was still good.
4263,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Chicken strips were soggy. Hash was flavorless cubes of potatoes. Eggs over medium was served over easy. Service was less than average.

I hardly write (negative) reviews. I really don't like this place."
4264,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is a must if you are a breakfast lover.  Wait was about 40 min. on a Sunday at 1.  We knew what we wanted so we ordered right away and our food came out in like 5 minutes.  I ordered what they're known for: the chicken & waffles and kiwi watermelon lemonade.  So good, but I could only finish about 1/3 of it and I was stuffed!  Not too pricey either; I would definitely come back!"
4265,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We were so excited to try this Iconic Indiana Eatery.  Located at the back of the Quad Resort  Casino a escalator plops you right in front of the eatery.

We tried the signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, a HH ginormous blue berry pancake and a pistachio ice mocha.  Okay first off, the portions are huge!  One pancake is probably enough for at least three people.  My benedict was gigantic as well but consisting of: mashed potatoes, biscuits, tomatoes, mozzarella, scrambled eggs, fried chicken and a pink country gravy the flavor combination was a little too muddled for my liking.  I can easily see the Sage Chicken and Waffle stack as being much better.  The pancake itself was tasty but it was so huge it was on the dry side also they need to serve this thing with a pitcher of syrup and lots of butter instead of the single scoop and tiny cup it came with.

My pistachio ice mocha was very good and even better after I stirred up the whipped cream to add some additional sweetness to the drink.  I could definately taste pistachio!

Over all I think we need to come back here and try the chicken waffle stack and maybe a stuffed burger to give a fair review, but for now I rate this as 3 stars."
4266,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Place is great had to wait on a Friday morning but worth the wait!!! The sizes are extreme, had to share with my friend and still took left overs back to the hotel! Definitely not a place if you are on a diet or even don't eat much!"
4267,Hash House A Go Go,1,I will never go here again.  I get it...its late...people are rude and drunk.  It's hard for servers.  But when we ask about an egg allergy and we are laughed at and the manager also doesnt care...that sucks.  We have been here MANY times and they have always accommodated us.  This time they were so rude and unprofessional that we will never visit again.  DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF FOOD ALLERGY.
4268,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hmm what can I say? Wait is ridiculous, services is average and food is ok... not worth the hype however it's not s terrible place... p.s use the restroom/wash your hands before you get there... they don't have a restroom â"
4269,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We came here for my husband's 30th birthday with a group of 13 and I don't think anyone left hungry or disappointed. The portions are HUGE and super delicious! Highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles and the Fried Green Tomatoes! So good. If you're in Vegas, this place is a must!"
4270,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Best value sit down restaurant on the Strip.  Portions are HUGE!!!  Its a good idea to share your meal because it will most likely go to waste if you order your own plate.

My wife and I shared a breakfast platter and there was more than enough for both of us.  There had to have been at least 4 eggs in the scramble that we got.  The biscuit was huge  and there was ample home fries. 

We got a side salad to share also as we have not been eating our fruits and veggies but the cucumber ranch dressing with the cheesy pollenta croutons was phenomenal!  The croutons were so good that we got a side order of them.  They were cheesy, soft in the middle but had a nice crunch to it.

Our waitress was super friendly and consistently filled our beverages.  We got our meal with in 10 minutes of ordering."
4271,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Holy helpings!!!! If you're looking for only one meal when in Vegas, this the place for you!! 

The serving sizes are ginormous and enough to share with at least 2-3 of your friends!!

If you go during breakfast/brunch time, please be prepared to wait up to 1 hour to be seated. If you're with a group, make sure everyone is there otherwise you won't be sat at your table.

Once you're sat, get ready for amazing service!!! Our server was quick and made sure we were taken care of the entire time! We never had to ask for water refills, she always kept our table clean, and made sure our food was delivered in a timely fashion. All food is cooked when you order it so be ready to wait longer than 10 minutes because they scratch cook everything!!! So worth it!

I ordered the crab cake Benedict and didn't share it with anyone which was a bad idea...I was only able to eat about 1/3 of it...so like I said, if you can share, do it!!!

Get ready to eat when you come here!!!"
4272,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What an amazing place. Came here twice in 3 days. Gargantuan portions so think about sharing a plate if you're not totally starving.  $6 bloody marys which were to die for. Afforfable, great fast service, kick ass cheap drinks, what's not too love? Oh yeah, dishes are so creative looking and delicious!"
4273,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My wife and I just went to Vegas for a quick getaway.  We were staying at The Quad (formerly Imperial Palace), and we went here four times during our stay.  The first time, we went for brunch and both ordered a meal.  The blueberry pancake was the size of a steering wheel!  My wife got the chicken and waffles.  The portions are enormous, but worth it.  The prices are great for the portions that you get.  The next time we ordered sandwiches thinking we could eat half of it and save it for later, which worked.  The next two times, we split a starter and a meal.  It worked out real well.  Especially since my wife is an employee of The Quad's parent company, so she gets a discount!  I would highly recommend anyone that is going to Vegas, regardless of where you're staying, to check out this restaurant.  Well worth the time and money.  Great service by all the servers we had.  Julien, Al, and Rochelle were fantastic!  Thank you for making our stay at The Quad much more enjoyable!"
4274,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions here are massive! My husband and I split the sage fried chicken and waffles, and we still couldn't finish it. The chicken and waffles were a little above average, but nothing outstanding. The price was fantastic for that much food. We would come back again for a big breakfast after a night out in Vegas."
4275,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of the most delicious places in Vegas. I had the opportunity to visit this place during my sister's bachelorette. Yes the wait was about 30mins to an hour but it was so worth it. At first we were worried if they would be able to accommodate 13 girls, but they found a way. The food portion was huge and mouth watering. The drinks were perfectly executed. This restaurant is definitely a place to try! Can't wait to go back to Vegas!"
4276,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This Hash House a Go Go is just ok. I have been to one other in the M resort and hotel and had a better experience there. This location is an older looking one. The smell of smoke from the downstairs area also creeps up. I ordered a pancake/eggs/sausage meal. The pancake was very, very large. The sausage and eggs were bland and below average. The price is seems to be a bit much just for a giant pancake and subpar eggs and sausage."
4277,Hash House A Go Go,4,Good food. Large portions. Two adults could not share one plate but we did not finish the egg plate and the very large pancake.
4278,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food has been amazing on the two occasions we've visited.  There is always a wait but the food is worth it.  They definitely don't skimp and the portions are more than generous.  Literally 2-3 people could share a plate.  Now, the 
3-star rating? The service is poor.  Once they seat you, it's like they have one waiter per 10 tables and they are very overwhelmed leaving them not being able to tend to all in a timely manner."
4279,Hash House A Go Go,2,I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of service my friend and I received as well as the food. It wasn't as good as I've heard it to be. I had the andy sage fried chicken with potatoes and my friend had the kokomo burger/sandwich. I had so much leftover that I took it to-go and gave it to a homeless person because I didn't want to waste the food... pretty disappointed.
4280,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I never mind waiting for great food! But.... I do mind waiting for average food, average service and a restaurant that has quite a few empty tables and booths. 

I don't understand why no one walks around with coffee at the place. Should be a full time position. I had to wait to get my first cup, begged for a second cup, and never got a third. 

My eggs were not over medium but over easy and very loose. I did not eat them and my waiter never came by to ask about our meal. That bothered me. 

Too many other places to go in Vegas. Won't be back."
4281,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow! This place has huge serving. We came here for lunch on a Saturday where there's a lot of people but only waited about 20mins. So I ordered the Caramel Overload Iced Coffee I think it was called, which was THE BOMB! If you love iced sweet coffee then you'll love this. Then I ordered the Chicken & Waffle which costs about $18 and I was surprised how huge it was! It's an art on a plate and at the same time, it was really good! The chicken was the bomb but the waffles are just okay. The serving was actually for two people. I got tired didn't even finish half of it so took it to-go then ate it later on. Lol. My boyfriend got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which I think was featured on the Man Vs Food show. He loved it but it's the first time in his lifetime that he wasn't able to finish his food not because it wasnt good but because its a HUGE serving. He's a big eater & a big guy so just imagine how big it was. Lol

The service was really good, staff are very friendly and nice. Place looks pretty cool, neat, casual, nothing fancy. Will definitely come back when we visit Vegas again!"
4282,Hash House A Go Go,3,I've been here twice now and service is a bit slow. Their sausage biscuits and gravy dish is not so good. There is no sausage to be seen in the plate! I asked the sever and she said that there's some in the gravy. I wish they offered sausage links on the side or something. Dish was very underwhelming and not worth getting. Tried some of the fried chicken Benedict and it was actually good. I wish the food would come out hotter too.
4283,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The restaurant is inside Linq Hotel. Very dark, loud, and messy. We order the sage fried chicken with waffles. There were a lot of flour and grease on the fried chicken. Not a lot of meat, just dough. There were bacon pieces of bacon inside but bad waffle batter. Do not recommend"
4284,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Atmosphere: Modern/stainless steel meets rustic charm (i.e. stainless steel tables with little wheat flower arrangements and rustic looking pictures).

Dress: Seemed like a variety of people. I would say snappy casual, though I don't think they care either way.

Food: wow! One plate filled both of us - we had the sage chicken penne pasta - it was great. There were two breasts, more than enough for two and it wasn't half bad either. Huge portions.

Service: Server was nice, asked if we wanted anything - the wait time for the food was pretty long though.

Room service: not that great. still big portions, but not impressed. was wondering if the quality goes down because you order in. Also, $3 convenience charge. Didn't like the breakfast hash at all. Our friends had the flapjack which was the size of the entire plate and very thick - fed three girls - it looked really good."
4285,Hash House A Go Go,1,This place did not even come close to living up to the hype. My husband and I are both chefs and this was highly recommend. The prices were decent but everything was very dry and needed more flavor and seasoning. Fried cardboard would have been better than the pathetic dry chicken I got. Not to mention the lack of any attentive servers. It took my husband until our meal was over to get 1 refill on a soda. What a waste of time and money.
4286,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Stopped here for a 1am dinner/breakfast! The red pepper and mozzarella burger was delicious, and so was the cucumber ranch dressing on my house salad. The portions are huge! 
My sister had the French toast and it was also very yummy. Definitely returning on my next trip to Vegas!"
4287,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Was really looking forward to this restaurant after reading good reviews, and it was pretty hyped as the go to breakfast spot on the strip. The meal left my wife and I really disappointed. Service was good and we were seated pretty quickly. We got there about 10am, but when we left at 11am the wait looked insane. I think this place is more about portion size and being visually fun than actual taste and quality. Totally fine if you want a huge portion, but for me I'd rather have quality over quantity. I got the sausage gravy with biscuits and egg. It honestly looked like vomit on a plate to me. The biscuits were really dry and sitting on a bed of mashed potatoes, was way too heavy. My wife got the sage chicken eggs Benedict and had about 5 bites before giving up. It was falling apart and just seemed like a ton of random lackluster ingredients throw on top of each other. For the money I'd rather eat elsewhere. Not our type of place, but might be to others."
4288,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Great food, open 24/7!  No wait - large dining area!  
Lots of great items on the menu - 
We had the pancakes bananas foster- large enough to share for 2....

My only wish is, that this place was accesible from the street; it took a while to get there through the casino... 
but well worth the journey!"
4289,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Large portions and good service Yes! Spongy waffle, semi warm food, no bathroom in the venue and lack of natural light (windows) NO!"
4290,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow....good food and a lot of it!   Share your meal with a friend.   The spot is very  much worth going to and is a great value  for the Las Vegas Stripe.  The only negative we saw was the  hostess on arrival...everything else is A#1.
4291,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Long wait for late breakfast/early lunch, close to an hour. Once seated, service was a bit slow (they were packed) and wait time for our orders was sluggish as well. Tried the made-famous Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles (thanks Adam Richman). Didn't really live up to the hype. Some nice flavor combinations, but the whole thing seemed a bit dry. All in all, Hash House was good but a bit over-hyped, over-priced, and probably not worth the wait next time we visit."
4292,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food was so so. They are known for their very large portions. So I just got the tenderloin pork Benedict. I was sharing it and still had almost half of it to finish. It reminded me of a pork Katsu just with gravy, eggs, spinach, tomatoes, and a biscuit. I would probably go here again if I was really hungry. 

Other than that they staff was nice. Although I had to wait 25 minutes to get in. When I got in they told me it would take another 45 minutes for the food to be ready. I am willing to wait for good food but this is not a place I would wait for again."
4293,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome customer service. We were seated pretty quickly. Food was seasoned and fresh. Coffee was strong and hot. Would definitely return
4294,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This restaurant was once on ""Man vs Food""! 90% of the food is big and most people are unable to finish their course. I had the BBQ Chicken Sandwich and I was able to finish the whole plate easily (I am 5'11 185lbs with an athletic build and a stomach that has a bottomless pit). The place is famous and the wait was approximately 30 minutes in length which isn't bad. Definitely a must try."
4295,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We tried out this place due to all the hype off of man vs food. First, this location purely sucks! it was hard finding it, it was random where it is at, ghetto feeling casino that felt dingy dirty etc..

interior decor of the restaurant was lack luster.... the hostess came across unprofessional regarding her demeanor. 

Food wise: we ordered the sage chicken and split it due to its size. Hands down this was a unique dish with a wonderful array of flavors. However, i didnt expect overcooked chicken, hard biscuits etc... 

I would try another location but not this one..."
4296,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The service was excellent. Our bartender/servers name was will and he was awesome. The only reason why I rated it 3 stars is because our fries were cold, and the sandwich didn't really have alot of flavor."
4297,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Tried the food here with two other friends, based on an absent friend's testimony, and the store's appearance on Man vs. Food. Although there was no nearly wait time when we arrived around 11:30am, what one would think is near peak hours for a restaurant, the food that arrived was pretty terrible. 

Ordering the tractor combo, $12.95, I got a fairly large blueberry pecan pancake (flour, eggs, buttermilk cheap carbs) with two eggs and two slices of bacon. One of my friends later pointed out that the pancake alone was $7.95. Ripoff combo? I think so. The quality of the pancake was on par with any IHOP or instant mix and the blueberries were undoubtedly frozen and few and far in between along with the pecans.

My other friends ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, $15.95, and a Burger, $13.95. The Sage Fried Chicken being the restaurant's signature dish seemed like it should be the best dish. However, all that arrived was a heaping mound of mash potatoes (very cheap carbohydrates once again) covered by greens and a pair of biscuits with a fried chicken breast steak. The chicken breast was so dry that the fibers were distinctly frazzled after a bite and tough enough to compete with jerky. The burger that came was clearly overcooked and consisted of low-quality ground beef and over-sized buns. 

Incessant praise for large portions at this restaurant seem misguiding in that only the cheapest components of each dish are liberally given while the main components (the protein and pricier ingredients) are sparse and low quality. Too many people are wowed by cheap filler and blind to the poor quality of the cooking here. Would definitely not come back. Just go to KFC or IHOP. I'm not fans of either but both are leagues ahead of this joint."
4298,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here yesterday for Thanksgiving brunch. We put our name down because we were told it was a 45 min to an hour wait. We walked around the new hotel LINQ and then went back after half hour. We were seated shortly after. Service was excellent!!!  The food was awesome, my son and I got the fried chicken with bacon waffles.  It was SO GOOD!  Hubby had a BBB sandwich which was good too but our dish was awesome!   The chicken was juicy and hsd a great sage flavor. The waffles had a long slice of bacon in each waffles. I can't wait to come back!  Just be prepared to wait."
4299,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'm going to give this place a E for effort. We had a very short wait. Almost seated immediately. We decided to try this place twice in Vegas because we had heard good things. We didn't want to try the chicken and waffles because we had heard other good things about hash a go go. 
This place was ""meh"". It's true. You get extremely large portions for your money. But bigger doesn't always mean better. Their food is bland and ""weird."" Although I don't know if that's the appropriate word. 
Hubby had the meatloaf. I had the fried chicken Alfredo. 
Our food came out in GIGANTIC portions. I mean like Jack and the Beanstalk big. 
The fried chicken was bland and the sauce for the chicken Alfredo was extremely bland. It was a mushroom sauce. What was weird about my Alfredo was that it has a half of apple at the bottom of it. Yup you read right. A half of a green apple. Yup weird right? I know. 
Hubby stuffed meatloaf was on top of fried mozzarella stuffed with mashed potatoes and greens. It left much be desired. Still bland yup. 
So we decided to give this place another try for breakfast. Hubby had he apple cinnamon pancake. The pancake was extremely thick with apple slices cooked inside the pancake. Hubby ate about a third of the pancake before he said he didn't want anymore because of the thickness of the pancake. He expresses the thickness of the pancakes took away from the flavor. 
I had French toast. It was dipped in banana cream batt r. To top it off. It had a sliced fried banana on top that was still in the peel. I didn't eat that. 
Their sausage and bacon were great. 
We had a total of 4 different meals from there. All weren't worth a returning visit. 
I definitely won't be visiting if I'm ever in Vegas again."
4300,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Tip: Order one entree and share! The portions here are so huge they are almost comical. It's no surprise since this place was featured on Man vs Food.

Came here around 12 AM after a late cirque du soleil show and was surprised to find that it was open 24/7. 

We tried the famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict because well, who wouldn't want to eat fried chicken and breakfast food at midnight? Especially when there's a large steak knife impaling your tower of food?

Price: Cost was about 19 dollars but it's enough food for two

Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - It's like egg's benedict, but with juicy buttermilk fried chicken breast with a nice herb seasoning. You'll find bacon, a bed of garlic mashed potatoes, scrambled cheesy eggs, an english muffin, some dried pasta sticks? and a stick of rosemary garnish all smothered in gravy. This stuff is your cardiologists' worst nightmare but tastes great.

Saw some other people order the pancakes here and I couldn't help but laugh at how large the flapjacks were.

Service: Staff looked like zombies at 12 AM and service was somewhat slow but not terrible.

Overall: 

Monstrous portions, heavy breakfast food 24/7, located in the Linq Casino."
4301,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh My Great Food Coma!  

Huge fan of huge portions of great food.
On this trip to Vegas for the Bodybuilding convention and was on the hunt for brunch.  After a Epic fail at another eating establishment......we were excited to come here.  We got the 411 from some local friends in the area.   A little hard to find, but worth every bite.  

The food is so flavorful, satisfying and leaves you wanting more. Have no fear, take it home and eat some for lunch!  

Huge portions.....no seriously they're huge.  Bodybuilders even said it was huge but finished everything and were still hungry about 3 hours later. This place is right up there with the Griddle Cafe in LA.  This will be a place I come visit more often.  

- Cara"
4302,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We had a favorable experience here. It was later in the night when we went and all my friends were drunk and obnoxious, so kudos to the staff at HHAGG to put up with drunken patrons night after night.

I got their well know chicken and waffles. Its $15 -18 I think (can't remember) but its ginormous. They chicken was delicious but their waffle was a bit soft for my liking, but I have a preference for crispier waffles. The bacon inside the waffle was a nice surprise and I must say, was definitely the bonus in the meal. It is definitely a shareable plate and I would love to come back here again for it.

If you haven't been, you must try."
4303,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I'm going to make this simple and sweet.  

I'D RATHER EAT AT KFC'S THAN EAT YOUR CHICKEN THAT COMES ALONG YOUR CHICKEN AND WAFFLES -- AND THAT'S SAY'N SUMTIN!  (Chicken just tastes like batter.  Where's the seasoning?)

Feel free to tell me why their Chicken and Waffles is so amazing.  Just try.  

They serve you so much, I bet whatever gets thrown away is enough to fatten every malnourished child in Africa.  I propose we start a Hash House A Go Go food drive and donate all your leftovers at the door.  

YAY FOR ENDING WORLD HUNGER!!!"
4304,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is great and there was SOOOOO MUCH of it!!  The Chicken and Waffles were so great I wish I could have eaten it all.  Next time I will share the meal with a friend.  Our waiter was great and kept the drinks filled.  When it came time to leave I asked if he could fill my metal water bottle with iced water and he had no problem doing that for me.  Thank you for a memorable meal in Vegas!
4305,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent food, gigantic portion sizes. I'd recommend skipping dinner the night before if you plan on finishing off a full plate. The chicken and waffles was a ridiculous stack of awesomeness, and the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict definitely lived up to its Man VS Food favorite (although it was a tad spicy)"
4306,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was really excited to try this place and everything was fine until I got home and realized they charged me twice on my card. The credit card machines were not working properly when we were there so I understand the mistake. But it's been a week and every time I call to try and get it fixed the phone just rings and rings and eventually just hangs up. I can't get ahold of anyone at the restaurant and when I tried calling the hotel to get some help, a very rude lady named Crystal answered and told me she couldn't do anything and I could call my bank and figure it out myself. I asked her if we could speak to a manager and she said there wasn't one available and that she was disconnecting the call and then hung up. Highly disappointed in the service at the restaurant and hotel. Will not be going back, especially if they are willing to take my money but not provide customer service when there is a problem."
4307,Hash House A Go Go,4,"psst... In the mood for some food the size of a freakin adult head!?!? Then you found the right place! better yet u better throw-up whatever you ate before to make room in your tum tum for these gigantic deeelishioius portions! ;) 

Hash house takes farm fresh food to a whole other level. otherwise known as ""twisted farm food"" this place has been entertaining all sorts of people young and old with their humungous portion sized food! 

I came here because Man vs Food did an episode here and they featured my favorite ""The Sage fried chicken and waffles"" (look in profile pictures) The taste was amazing and the chicken was so tender and juicy! waffle was homemade with BACON inside you get 4 big ones!! are you kidding me!??! i just wish i had a bigger stomach, i just couldn't finish it.. 

Another great dish you gotta try is Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs!  ""yall ain't ready for this!"" there's so much food on this plate you need 4 people just to finish this s$#t!! YUM! :D 

Seriously, your gonna have a hard time even deciding what to order when or if you come down here! just come really HUNGRY!  i swear i got 20 pounds heavier after this damn vacation!!!! 

Damn you Vegas!.... Damn you..."
4308,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband and I went here on New Year's Day, and I expected it to be a little hectic given it's amazing reviews and hangover-friendly fare.  We arrived at about 10:30 AM, and the wait was surprisingly only about 30 minutes. Score!  A huge plus was the bloody Mary bar at the hostess stand that was serving the Farmer's Bloody Mary (I think that's what it was called).  It was perfectly spicy with a yummy pickled green bean, which I'm pretty sure was my husband's favorite part.  Luckily for me, he's easy to please.

We were seated very quickly after our name was called, right as we were finishing up our drinks.  Our server's name was Gabby, and she was extremely attentive, helpful with menu suggestions and had an overall great personality.

We ordered another bloody Mary to split: the BLT in a large souvenir glass.  The bacon was really good, but the toast and lettuce were obviously just for show.  We didn't care, we ate them anyway.  Honestly, the toast was kind of like a crouton in that the crunch factor was super strong, so it was pretty good dipped in the Mary.  But maybe it's because we were still halfway buzzed. Anyway, the Mary was big enough to split and really good, but the Farmer is definitely where it's at. I ordered the meatloaf hash for my meal with over-medium eggs, and my husband ordered the chicken and waffles.  They both got destroyed. I'm going to say there was at least a half of a very well seasoned crispy-fried chicken on his plate, along with 4 fluffy Belgian waffles with bacon cooked right into them. I'm glad he went to the restroom halfway through the meal, because I was able to stealthily snag at least 5 giant bites without him even noticing. It was that huge of a serving.  He was even nice enough to let me have some of his fried leeks, which were delicious on their own and mixed in with my hash.  The meatloaf is damn good, especially mixed all together with perfectly cooked over-medium eggs, melty cheese, country style potatoes, peppers, onions (and those addictive crunchy little fried leeks).  I sprinkled some pepper sauce on top and went to town, finishing pretty much all of it except some extra potatoes that didn't make it onto my fork.  It also came with a big, fat buttermilk biscuit which I took a few bites of, but would have been even better with butter and some homemade jam.  I didn't ask for it, because I already felt fat enough.

We waddled out of the restaurant all smiles, completely full, but not feeling weighed down and gross like you just ate a bunch of junk.  This is some top-notch home-cooked stuff-your-face-like-you-don't-give-a-what food. If you don't eat here the next time you visit Vegas, you will have missed out on experiencing one of the most orgasmic, overindulgent culinary experiences you will ever have in your life."
4309,Hash House A Go Go,5,"For the ladies out there who maybe aren't interested in dominating the enormous portions offered here, try the Fried Green Tomato Stack...it's UH-MAZING! This smaller and lighter dish offers slices of fried green tomatoes sandwiched between chicken salad and everything has great flavor! I highly recommend this dish!"
4310,Hash House A Go Go,5,The Sage chicken and waffles are AMAZING. Jose one of the managers was very helpful and hospitable. I will definitely be back soon!
4311,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best food! Must go to for breakfast or lunch! Left here pretty happy with tummy full
4312,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Let down by poor service, very bad first impression from the greeter. I had the Chorizo hash sitting at the bar, solo, good food, generous portions. 

Shame about the service, also very dark. Lots of building going on in the hotel so maybe excuses the darkness."
4313,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We arrived at the Quad pretty late and were starving.. Luckily, Hash House A Go Go is open 24/7 now!! 

My friend and I shared the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It was huge!! We both couldn't finish it. It was pretty delicious though. It was like a big dinner all mashed into one plate and topped with cheese. UGH I want more. All the different ingredients blended well together and the chicken was crispy on the outside but tender inside. 

Service was pretty good, our server checked on us often and gave us suggestions.
Will definitely want to go back to try some of the other things on their menu next time!"
4314,Hash House A Go Go,4,If you're one for large portions this is the spot for breakfast lunch or dinner in Vegas.
4315,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food and plenty of it. Fried chicken and waffles was great. Upon seeing the size of the portions, 4 of us ordered 2 dinners and left food behind. Highly recommended."
4316,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is crazy busy at breakfast time. It's located upstairs in the Linq casino and the waiting area was bursting at the seams. One downfall here is that they only use a PA system to call you to your table so you are stuck waiting in all that chaos. I think our wait was well over an hour. They have a Bloody Mary bar set up in the waiting area which would have been great if it was properly staffed. Service was super slow. 

Once we were seated things moved along pretty quickly. I ordered the BLT Bloody Mary but when they brought it there was no bacon. The server ended up bringing me a piece of bacon wrapped in a napkin. Sort of took away from the whole experience. On top of everything It was not the best Bloody Mary I have had. 

The food was really good. The portions were huge! We had to try the signature sage chicken Benedict. It was very unique and tasted great. I really loved the mashed potatoes. I would return but I would try to come at a less popular time or try the off strip location."
4317,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions. The chicken and waffles is totally legit, we didn't even finish the order and 2 of us were working on it. Corned beef and hash was great, as well, with thick slices of beef and plenty of potatoes. We ended up with a ton of takeout boxes. Definitely plan on sharing your meal with someone if you don't want to end up doing the same.

Service was good, even though the restaurant was super busy. Restaurant can be a little tough to find if you don't know exactly where to go in the Linq."
4318,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Jessica was our server and she was a ray of light. She was fast, got our order, and was super charming. We'll be back to see her."
4319,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're looking for a big breakfast in Las Vegas, this is your spot!!! If not you can share it's plenty to go around. The wait was a tad bit long but other than that it was excellent from the waiter to the food"
4320,Hash House A Go Go,1,Ugh. Not good. Food was nothing special and overpriced. Bananas in the fruit cup were so bitter and under ripe they were inedible.  There are a lot of places to get a better breakfast. The only plus is that the restaurant is big so the wait is reasonable and it's open 24 hours.
4321,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hungry? You better be if going to the Hash House! Stayed at Imperial Palace for a recent convention and ate at the HH each of the three mornings. Tried to give another place a shot but it was as if a giant pork covered magnet was pulling me in.

Their coffee rivals any Starbucks/coffee house. Seriously. It's hot, it's dark and it's good stuff. No need for sugar or cream, just man up and drink it like it was meant to be drunk.

My first breakfast was a chorizo, jalepeno, tomato, cheesy hash and it was fantastic. Potatoes in the hash are perfectly crisp. Over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and served with a fluffy biscuit and fruit. Wonderful, homemade jam sits at every table.

Second day I went with The Basic which is 2 eggs, potatoes, fruit and a biscuit. I added bacon for an extra $2.50. I probably should have left the bacon off as it was a little disappointing. I know, I know. Bacon? Disappointing? Not sure how those two words could ever be uttered in the same breath but my two strips were melded together and a little overdone. Reminded me of the bacon in the cafeteria of the hospital I work in. Pre-cooked and piled into a metal pan and heated on the grill for each order.

Last morning was a Saturday morning and the place was slammed so I sat at the bar. I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy breakfast which comes with two eggs, fruit and mashed potatoes. I really wanted to order according to menu and try the mashed potatoes but those crispy potatoes are sooooo good that I made the substitution for the mashed. Tasty gravy with nice big chunks of sausage!

All the dishes are nicely arranged and garnished. Each morning my biscuit came with a sprig of rosemary sticking out of it. Nice touch.

The atmosphere is pleasant with good music being piped in. Wait staff is friendly and service is fast. On the morning I sat at the bar for breakfast, the bartender asked if I drank and I replied to the affirmative. (Hello!?  Is this not Vegas??!!) Next thing I knew there was a gratis mimosa sitting next to my coffee. 

Yep, I'm a fan!"
4322,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ate here twice in one week!  Yeah, we may need our heart monitored for a couple months but SO worth it!    Huge portions- but who cares about portion if the food isn't up to par?? -Don't worry, they've got that covered!  Everything we had here was so tasty and perfectly cooked.  Even the butter for those Goliath biscuits they give you at dinner was amazing.  Hangover food?  Certainly.  ""I'm in Vegas and want to eat like a stoned Elvis"" food?  Absolutely.  I'm writing this and tears of joy are swelling up in my eyes from the memories.  5 stars all the way. And thank you kind waitress that suggested the meatloaf - I love you."
4323,Hash House A Go Go,5,Omg so bomb! You really only need to get one dish bc the portions are so big and you can just share it. Got the fried chicken on a biscuit with eggs Benedict and chipotle sauce...I don't even like chipotle sauce but this thing was so good! Took a nap in the car for about an hour afterwards !
4324,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have been to Hash House A Go Go twice this year and it has been a fairly good experience each time. I've tried the burgers, pot pie, chicken & waffles, and the chicken pasta. The food is good for the price and the portions are huge. The customer service is never a problem as well."
4325,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Everytime we visit Vegas we eat at Hash House A Go Go....and everytime it's fuckn good. Their recipes are consistent.  Today we had fried chicken & mashed potatoes with a side of biscuits and gravy. We learned some time ago to share plates because of the huge serving of food. Not to mention the service was great and a tight atmosphere. Good music too...only downside is waiting 40 minutes to be seated but then again, it's Vegas!!!"
4326,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I came here yesterday after a great weekend celebrating a friend's bachelor party. With 4 of us left, it only took about 20 mins to get a table.

The portions here are huge and the prices to match. If you don't want to leave in a stretcher or get a doggie bag, I would recommend sharing a plate. Two of my friends go the chicken and waffles, which were 2 giant chicken breasts with 4 bacon waffles. and we're not talking fluffy light waffles, we're talking batter dense waffles. I got the Chicken, potatoes, eggs, and bacon with a biscuit.  that was also very good.  the chicken has a great seasoning on it and lots of moisture, especially for the breast meat. potatoes had (I think) grilled mozzerella in them, which was cool.  The biscuit was surprisingly a little on the dry chalky side, but they had some nice jam and butter to help that.

If the portions were smaller and prices lower to match, it would definitely be 5 stars, but the portions and prices were just a little to ridiculous for me. But I guess that's Vegas? or maybe the expanding waistline of America."
4327,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place! Been here twice and it hasn't disappointed me. The food is delicious and the portions are huge, so make sure you come in with an appetite. I recently had the bone in rib-eye and it came with some really delicious pumpkin mashed potatoes along with some vegetables. Had the chicken and waffles before that and I could barely eat half the plate... And I do enjoy eating food, so you know there's a problem there. Lol"
4328,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Loved, loved, loved it. We did wait probably 45 minutes (granted it was noon Friday before the mayweather/pacquiao fight). The food is Fantastic (I got the vanilla waffle which covered 3/4 of a big plate) and great price - much cheaper than most places on the strip - and food was some of the best we had. Atmosphere was great - and anyplace I can get breakfast after 11 am is good in my book. Definitely will visit again and one is recommend is a must eat (for breakfast food at least)"
4329,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is a great place to eat in Vegas. The food is delicious and they serve a variety of fun drinks to add to your Vegas experience.  I would not say the food is for the incredibly health conscious. The portion are humongous so we shared one meal for two people. I am glad we went here.
4330,Hash House A Go Go,4,"PREPARE TO SHARE!  They weren't kidding when they said the portions were huge.  I should have planned better after food cruising on the way to my seat and seeing the size of the plates. They are enormous!  That aside, they are creative!  I posted a pic of the menu. There were at least 5 things in the running for my breakfast. I landed on the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and my bf had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  When they arrived we were blown away (see pics).  

My chicken was cooked very well. The batter was crispy and not too heavy. The waffles were packed with bacon IN them. But the best were the strips of fried leeks that graced the top and the drizzle of syrup. My only complaint is that I wanted more syrup which could have easily been addressed had I asked my super friendly waiter. 

The Benny was also huge and very well presented. The biscuits were warm and wonderful. They were dense and biscuit experts may say they weren't flakey enough, but then they were covered with a hollandaise sauce that had a little kick. The fresh, red mashed potatoes were home-style (nicely lumpy) and an odd but tasty addition to a breakfast dish. 

We can't leave without mentioning the awesome tangerine house mimosa.  The cranberry was ok, but the tangerine blew it away. The food was great but not 5 star outstanding (I rarely give 5 stars anywhere). But I can't recommend this place highly enough. Come hungry, leave happy with a doggie bag."
4331,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ok, so I've heard so many things about Hash House A Go Go, my expectations were high, but you kinda disappointed me... The wait was crazy, yes, I get that, it's Vegas, St. Pattys Day/March Madness weekend, but we got there at 11:30 and didn't get to eat until about 1:45. Really? The reason we stuck around was because we heard good things about the food. So we get seated and place our orders and I got the Salmon Benedict (mind you, it's not the traditional Hollandaise sauce, it was a red chili cream which was yum); but I was all stoked because it was supposed to come with basted eggs. Imagine my disappointment when it came with scrambled eggs (yes, I know wahhhh). I was going to send it back, but after waiting that long, I didn't dare chance it. It was still yum...Our waitress was super sweet, I'm knocking off 2 stars for the wait and the hosts, because they actually forgot about us and finally sat us when someone in my party went up and said, hey, what the French Toast? :) Perhaps I need to go to San Diego and see how it's really done."
4332,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Okay, tons of food and at a reasonable price. Presentation is great, the wait is usually long; but worth it. Leave with a full tummy and a big smile!"
4333,Hash House A Go Go,4,"great food, awesome portion size.  seemed like we were neglected as we sat for awhile before being seated and others were getting right in.  once we sat down we barely saw our waitress. overall though I highly recommend"
4334,Hash House A Go Go,4,Decent prices for Vegas.  Food is good and Portions  are huge.  They are open 24/7 so be warned of drunk and obnoxious patrons in the wee hours.
4335,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food!! Ginormous portions! Flavorful and creative! For a busy spot on the Las Vegas strip, they had great service and a fun atmosphere. Our server, Travis, was new and he was the best service we had had in Vegas this past weekend! He was thorough and attentive!! The kids LOVED his Mohawk too!!"
4336,Hash House A Go Go,4,Log wait! BUT! You pretty much have to wait to be seated at any place with good brunch so it wasn't too bad. The portions are huge. We ordered two for the table and all shared. It took forever for them to come out but they were good when they arrived. Texas Bloody Mary was good! The sausage and biscuits were great and the ranchero eggs were great as well. We really enjoyed this place!
4337,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Because I'm such a fan of Tractor Room and Great Maple, I can admit that my expectations of HHAGG were VERY VERY HIGH. Although I think the San Diego location is better, the Vegas location did deliver.

The wait was a little under an hour to get seated, but the time between ordering and receiving your food was insane. We literally waited an hour to eat after ordering. Granted it was Saturday morning, but arriving at 10 we were certain we were going to beat the brunch rush. Apparently everyone else had the same idea.

The other bummer for me was that EXACT DAY they debuted the new menu which no longer features the breakfast pot pie. To say my heart was shattered would be an understatement. 

Although devastated, I pulled myself together and ordered the bacon, avocado scramble with egg whites and light cheese. The meal was delicious but not anything spectacular that seemed like a HH signature."
4338,Hash House A Go Go,5,It's a Vegas staple for me now.  Food is incredible and the prices are more than fair for the volume you get.  I'll hit here every time I can.
4339,Hash House A Go Go,3,I would have given them a 5 with my order alone. But my husband whom was willing kind and patient to wait 40 mins to be seated after quoted 30 and willing to wait another 30 mins for breakfast that became lunch hated his oatmeal and still had to pay for it after he left a plate full. Terrible turn out. Not charging him or giving him a discount for next time would've made it a 5! Las Vegas needs customer satisfaction training. We have this restaurant next to us in Celebration FL which he used to frequent often. This could've been top eating experience in Vegas for us.
4340,Hash House A Go Go,5,"VERY VERY GOOD!
Huge portions so plan to take home, be hungry, or share your plate.
Everything is homemade so it takes awhile to get to your table but it is well worth the wait. 
I had the cornbeef hash. I've never had it like this before (REAL meat). The biscuit it came with was so buttery, fluffy on the inside, and the right amount of crispy on the outside.
They also have different flavored mimosas (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, apple, tangerine...) I had the pineapple and tangerine. Tangerine wasn't any different than a regular mimosa, but the pineapple was delicious.
Staff is very friendly and helpful. The wait is long, but you can order drinks while you wait! :)"
4341,Hash House A Go Go,5,"By far the best Breakfast place on the Las Vegas Strip!  If you have a Total Rewards Diamond or Platinum card, take advantage of it's benefits.  Walk by everyone seated in line and head to the left side of the hostess stand.  Show them your TR card and ID for the next available table.  A tip here to the hostess would be good karma since you just bypassed a hour long wait.  Once seated and your food is ordered, it will take a bout 20 minutes for your food to arrive.  It is worth the wait.  Everything on the menu is HUGE and meals can almost be shared.  Enjoy your food and expect to be in a food coma afterwards."
4342,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I dont usually give 5 stars but this place was AMAZING!!! I went my birthday weekend with my boyfriend and initially they sai our wait would be an hour but after about 5 minutes a woman came out and said we could sit at the bar and still order food so we did and it was soooo good! 
I got the Farm Scramble with Bacon, Onion and Swiss sans the avacado (I'm not a avacado for breakfast kinda girl) and my boyfriend got the brown sugar banana flapjack sans the banana ( he's allergic) with a side of bacon and crispy potatoes. The only small issue was that the crispy potatoes were a little dark but compared to the overall experience it was minor. The flapjack was AMAZING in fact so good I hate half of it! I highly recommend this place and would definitely come again,
 Customer service was also excellent and our bar tender (Kai I believe) was super funny and helpful. They deserve these 5 stars."
4343,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Share your meal with someone! The portions are huge!! Only 4 stars because I'm not sure if I'm in Vegas again I'd make a trip back to hash a go go. 

Everything is fresh. The biscuit i could do without. It's super dense, you could probably hurt someone if you threw it across the room. 

Our waitress was helpful, not extremely happy or eager but would ask if we had any questions. They play good music here! Better than the clubs! haha

2 friends shared the BBBLT soooo much bacon!! 
I shared the Hash with artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and spinach comes with 2 eggs and fruit. (we didn't even finish and could have easily shared with another person)  
2 other friends shared the chicken salad sandwich. 

Everyone said they enjoyed their food. 

HINT: make sure everyone in your party is present or else they won't seat you or give you a pager!"
4344,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food, finding the place took forever.
The wait to sit on a Sunday wasn't bad, we did however wait a LIL long for the food.
Our waitress was nice, and the prices weren't so bad"
4345,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Bring an appetite......leave broke.  That about sums up Hash House.

Yes, the portions at Hash are huge and really too much for one person to conceivably consume in one setting but I thing that is part of the draw to Hash....you know you're going to get a lot of food.

What Hash makes up in quantity, it lacks in quality.  It is overpriced for the type of food that is being served for being basically just a diner.

You need to get there early because mid morning, the wait is about an hour + to get a table.  I think there were more people waiting in line than there we in the Imperial Palace total.

Staff is friendly and once seated, service is good.

If you've never been, I would definitely make it a stop while in Vegas but having been there, done that, I probably won't return since we have a Hash in my hometown of SD."
4346,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food was great! The plates are big but ask the waiter which one are the smallest !! The sage fried chicken is to share amazing chicken and waffle !!! 
The scramble eggs are big but is nice for one person !
The coffee is very good! It's like Colombian coffee !! I love this place is a most go!"
4347,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Dined here multiple times. Both at the bar and in the dining room. Last time we were a party of ten. The servers were great, food was awesome and there was plenty to share! Overall, prices are fair and many different tastes can be accommodated.."
4348,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Twisted farm food is a great descriptor for this place.  Ended up splitting Andy's sage fried chicken benedict style with a friend because the portions are ridiculous.  Normally, restaurants serve you a ton of food to make up for poor quality, but Hash House just serves up crazy amounts of crazy good food.  Great place, the wait was a little much but that's why you're they're housed inside a casino right?"
4349,Hash House A Go Go,4,Huge portions. amazing comfort food. The Bloody Mary is something to behold. Definitely worth the wait.
4350,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very good! Portions big. Long lines, wait but popular place because it's so good. Wait staff excellent. It's a must, to eat. Very unique menu."
4351,Hash House A Go Go,4,"On the 2nd floor of the LINQ hotel/casino, Hash House a Go Go is a HUGE restaurant with intimidatingly huge plates. After a long wait, the single pancake I got with blackberries and granola, which was quite good, was literally too large for me to finish. I also liked the fresh tangerine juice."
4352,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Out of all the places I visited at Vegas, THIS is the one that I can't WAIT to come back to. 

We were greeted warmly and waited for a half an hour for a spot. To be expected as this place was buzzing with hype. We marveled at the hostesses yelling voice as she called for party after party after party. 

We sat and the server was fun and spunky and had a slight twang. Loved it.

We shares three plates for five grown ass men. We walked out full. 

The Benedict is to die for. I will be eating this every time I come back to Vegas. The other two dishes were great as well but just weren't as memorable as that Benedict. Something about that conglomeration of great foods with that chipotle sauce...

Walked out extremely satisfied. I will definitely be back."
4353,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I want to begin by saying how pleased I was with the service, both with the hostess and our waitress. The hostess was fighting a losing battle with the hordes of rude and disgruntled Vegas throng, yet the smile and enthusiasm never left her. That was very impressive to me. Our waitress was also very friendly, professional and helpful, especially considering how packed it gets. They should both be commended for that, as well as management. 

Now, on to the constructive criticism: The food. I have to say, when the food came, I was very happy with the presentation, as it looked gorgeous and was very pretty. I have included a picture of our meals to illustrate this point. The disappointment came when I took my first bite and the taste did not match the presentation. I found a meal incredibly bland and flavorless... although I have to give credit where credit is due and say that the biscuit was wonderful. But in a full large meal, it's unfortunate that the biscuit was the best part. I feel that with Vegas being so competitive as far as restaurants, they need to re-assess their offerings, although maybe it was just my specific meal... I don't know. 

Overall, it was not a bad experience, it's just that I was incredibly underwhelmed by the food, especially based off of the great service and presentation that the restaurant gives."
4354,Hash House A Go Go,5,I ALWAYS hit up Hash House in San Diego (the original) AND Orlando... Vegas.... Chicago... Reno... Plano.... SEEK IT OUT!!! Corey and Gary are the BOMB and will hook u UP!!!! Nomnomnomnom!!!!! WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!
4355,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I ordered the Man Vs. Food Fried Chicken and Eggs Benedict... Wow! The chicken was tender and the eggs were not over cooked. The mashed potatoes were flavorful and the biscuit soft and crumbly.  I even enjoyed the chipotle sauce that was poured over the entire thing. It wasn't too creamy and it had a nice kick. And of course, the meal was ginormous!  (Perfect for sharing.)  Even though it was HUGE, this didn't take away from its quality.  All the ingredients were still fresh! This seems pretty true about all other meals served there.  You get quantity and quality."
4356,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Damn the food was amazing and OMG server Nancy was the best server I had in years (and that's not putting any extras on it) she made my experience good and was great help with the menu and letting me know that the stuff was gonna be big so I might wanna share...but I don't lol, so I hope the bump Nancy up in the company because she deserve it...sweet, patient and knows the menu well....I'll be back prolly for dinner again before I head back LA California. Jus hope the food taste great like last night and I get the same server"
4357,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food waa good but the service sucked! First time at this location but not first time at restaurant chain. The wait was shorter than expected but the wait for our drinks of soda, food, check were longgggggg. A server whose name I believe was Josh was just so disorganized I felt like he went in circles just to get to each table and he only have 5! I only have it 3 stars because of the food."
4358,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When we arrived there was a 30-49 minute wait, but the line and seating moved quickly so we were seated within 30 minutes. 
The best part about this meal was definitely the portion size. We ended up only getting 3 meals between the 4 of us, and we still had leftovers! We ordered the classic 2 egg breakfast, the chicken fried steak and the sage chicken and waffles. 
The chicken fried steak was huge, and really well cooked and seasoned. The sausage gravy on the top was a highlight of the meal! 
In my opinion though the winner of best dish goes to the chicken and waffles! The breading on the chicken was very tasty and so crispy! The chicken breasts were tender and very juicy, but slightly underseasoned without the breading. The bacon waffles were the perfect complement to the chicken.
The price I feel is pretty accurate for the amount of food, and the location. If this restaurant had been somewhere other than in Vegas, it might have been overpriced, but in Vegas it's pretty par for the course. The 4 star rating is based on the need for seasoning on just about everything, it just needed a little more salt, overall."
4359,Hash House A Go Go,5,Some of the best food I've ever had in my entire life. Ginormous food portions. Amazing drinks. Food so good... worse making yourself sick from eating too much! YUM.
4360,Hash House A Go Go,2,I had been hearing great things about Hash House A Go Go .....my food was pretty good buuuut the customer service sucked and it seemed like all the tables around us had a complaint about their food. We had to wait over 20 minutes to get our check after having to ask for it. Since my food was pretty good i will more than likely eat at Hash House again but definitely NOT this location.
4361,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Overall everything was good.   We had the chicken and waffles, brown sugar flapjack and a basic breakfast.   Chicken and waffles were on point.   Flapjack was ok. The bananas tasted like they were still green and pretty firm.  Would have been a 4-5 star but the flapjack turned us off."
4362,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best hangover food in Vegas ever! Share your meal, expect a wait, order drinks and enjoy!"
4363,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Here's another awesome restaurant in the middle of the Vegas strip. From our initial table request to paying the final bill, the experience was exceptional. The portions are HUGE so I split a breakfast meal with my sister. My husband and brother-in-law both enjoyed an awesome Bloody Mary and breakfast meals. I would definitely recommend, would return on another visit, and give this overall dining experience the highest review."
4364,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is a really cheap place to have really filling food. You will wait an hour at least but its worth it since there are not a lot of places in Vegas where you can have a decent breakfast. It is located inside the Linq hotel, the only downside to this place is that it's located above a casino and the entire wait I the lobby and the entire time you eat all you smell is smoke. It's kind of hard to enjoy your breakfast when you're inhaling smoke in between each bite. My advice would be for the owners to invest in a better air filtration system for the dining areas so patrons don't have to inhale tobacco while downing a bacon filled waffle."
4365,Hash House A Go Go,4,Thought this was going to be a typical restaurant especially since it was in the IP. Was really impressed with the decor- it had a great feel. Our waiter was SO nice and really loved his job. I was really overwhelmed with menu options since it was non-traditional. I ended up getting a skillet with bacon and avocado and it was really good.
4366,Hash House A Go Go,4,Amazing food! I can with two other friends. I ordered the chicken and waffles and one of my friends ordered biscuits and gravy. The chicken waffles were amazing the friend chicken was very crispy and the waffles had bacon in it. Great combination with the fried leeks. I tried my friends biscuits and gravy and they were really good as well. It had mash potatoes underneath and those are one of the best mash potatoes I have had. This place is pretty busy but not a long wait. Service a little slow but understandable for how busy it is.
4367,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My friends and I came on a friday morning and the wait was only 15 minutes or so. Really not bad at all, seeing as how when I tried to come back on saturday with a different group of friends it was a hour and a half wait.

The food was good but not worth that type of wait. I ordered the chicken and waffles, which were on all the advertisements of this place. The serving size is the real star of the whole dish: four large waffles and two huge pieces of chicken skewered together by a steak knife. The chicken was fried well but tasted bland, nothing to really write home about. The waffles were interesting in that the had two pieces of bacon inside of them. Again the waffles were good also but nothing spectacular. I prefer quality over quantity but this dish really exemplifies quantity.

The atmosphere of the place is what would be expected of a diner with a rock flair to it. It was fun to see all the celebrities that have come through this place though. They have autographed pictures on the wall in the waiting area.

Our waiter was friendly when he was around but that was few and far between. It seemed like it was too busy for him to provide the service that you would expect. I don't think anyone at my table got a refill on any of our drinks.

Overall, I'm glad I at least tried this place once and I would eat at it again...but I wouldn't wait  any longer than 15 minutes. Vegas has plenty of places that serve better food albeit smaller or normal sized portions."
4368,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is worth the good reviews!  We had the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend and I LOVED it.  One dish was actually big enough for the two of us and I will definitely be back! The chicken was warm and crispy and flavored well. Our waffles actually had bacon in it also. superb!
4369,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had the crab benedict the portions are huge, hot, and pulled sky high!! Don't plan on finishing the entire meal. You're gonna definitely have something to take with you. Our server was named Courtney she was amazing. The food arrived to our table so quickly we were shocked. I would definitely return."
4370,Hash House A Go Go,3,I don't really understand the hype of this place. The food isn't anything special and is pretty bland. We went after a show one night since we were staying nearby.  The biscuits for my biscuits and gravy were on the hard side. My husband's pancake was the best part of our experience. It had a nice vanilla flavor to it and the perfect texture. My Bloody Mary was underwhelming and I've had way better closer to home. It doesn't matter that they serve huge portions since the food isn't that good.
4371,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Service is incredibly slow and the food isn't spectacular enough to make up for the wait. That being said, the food was decent and the drinks were pretty good. Keep in mind, I came on Sunday during the brunch rush."
4372,Hash House A Go Go,4,As I waited for my food to be delivered I couldn't help but to drool over all that was coming out the kitchen. Everything is such big portions and has succulent presentation. My friend and I shared a salad and the 18oz steak cooked medium. Price is great for the quality! I don't eat steak often but this was the best one yet! The veggies on the plate complimented the meal greatly. I requested the garlic potatoes instead of the pumpkin but was not fulfilled. My waiter brought out my desired side immediately and that was good. At one point of my meal I ran out of water and had to ask for my glass to be refilled. I didn't fuss too much about it. The atmosphere was very nice! I noticed the bar and the televisions displaying sports. I highly recommend and ill definitely be returning! Woohoo go farm food! Lol
4373,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I came here hungry with a friend who said this place was great. It was supposed to have huge portions and it was right on. I was starving and left completely stuffed, and I didn't even finish my meal. I had the signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. The chicken breast was juicy and crispy, with a sage and garlic batter, extremely tasty. They served two of them along with 4 waffles, with chunks of apple wood bacon cooked inside. I thought this was going to taste great, but it was a bit plain and doughy. It was served with reduced maple syrup for extra flavor. I couldn't even finish 2 waffles. I enjoyed it, but needed to walk off all that food, which took a while. I would go back to try their stuffed burgers next time. I saw someone eating one and it looked very tasty."
4374,Hash House A Go Go,4,A lot of food for the money! The chicken and waffles are really good and perfect to share. The pancakes are huge and delicious! Only issue was the service was very slow.
4375,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It's now in The Quad! Not imperial palace!

This was pretty bomb. Most chicken and waffles to me are just bleh... because its literally just chicken... and waffles, neither of which were particularly made special.

Beware, their portions are HUGE! Sharing is caring!

-[[ Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles]]-

The chicken as so juicy and seasoned well!!! I think this is one of the things that make their chicken and waffles so different from others. I've had Roscoes... and its just MEH compared to HHAGG. Their waffles are OMG BOMB!!! It had bacon running through it!! Genius if you ask me!!! The waffles were crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. 

-[[ Farm Scrambled ]]-

The eggs were cooked to perfection and the potatoes were irresistible! 

-------

This is a great place for an early breakfast or a late night snack after partying a little too hardy.... =) Great comfort food! 

-{{ Overall tastiness experience }}-

I give it 5 stars for the best chicken and waffles I've ever had."
4376,Hash House A Go Go,5,My favorite brunch spot in Vegas!  Make sure to make a reservation days in advance though! Country fried steak and eggs is HUGE!
4377,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I refuse to vist Las Vegas with out having to stop by. I use to visit NV every 6 months but as i grew older my body can no longer keep up with the played out hype. One of my must haves/do's when i visit is HASH HOUSE A GO GO! Word of advice cancel any dinner plans you have that evening for you will be leaving with left overs. My girls and i have a ritual where we eat there for breakfast and take our heaping loads of left overs back to the hotel and eat the remainder for dinner while we soak our screaming feet from all the walking on the strip in our jacuzzi in our room. 
My sister had the CHICKEN POT PIE, and my jaw dropped when i saw it. That thing was bigger than my head and trust me thats pretty big! I couldn't help myself i took a bite and the crust of the pie was delicious.  You can tell they don't short you on butter because the crust was so crispy and buttery.. I need to move on or i may never stop talking about it.
I decided to try the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES since their menus put soo much emphasis on it. I would be lying if i said i totally loved it. It came with reduction syrup that i wasn't too much of a fan of for i felt it compromised the flavor a bit. Don't get me wrong the dish was good i guess i just played it up too big in my head. 
My girls each had a meal from their HASH selection and they loved what they got i just can't remember which ones they chose. 
Be prepared for it can take an hour to be seated especially if you go there during breakfast peak hours. But i can assure you  the wait is worth it!"
4378,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yummy food, portions are gynormous. Service is somewhat slow but if you have never been it's worth trying at least once."
4379,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is my first stop when I'm in Vegas for any meal. The portions are so big and yes its a bit pricey but well worth the money. I've ordered the Chicken and waffles and I've also had the pancake which happens to be the size of the plate. The service is great and fast. You might have to wait for a table depending on what time you get there but over all this place rocks.

You must try their bloody Mary super spicy and a huge glass of delight."
4380,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is awesome! really good comfort food but believe me when I say extremely large portions. I've learned to share entrees here unless I want a second meal to take home because there's no way you can finish a dish by yourself. I've had the bacon avocado burger before and the corned beef hash and I've never been disappointed with the food. This time I had the grilled cheese which they spruce up with bacon and tomato. Perfect! Definitely the best place to go for drunk food or hangover food. It is a little heavy though if you're looking for something lighter. 

Service is ok nothing spectacular but not bad. The linq location is usually busier than some of the others so expect less interaction with your server. This time the server dropped the bill right when we got the food so it seemed kind of rushed. When I went to pay for my $16 check I left a $20 and asked for change back. She forgot to bring it and when I said it's ok take your time she only heard it's ok and thought I meant keep the change which is fine but I feel like she forced me to tip her extra for average service. Not a huge deal I let her keep it. Just a little uncomfortable 

Definitely try this place. It's a cool food experience"
4381,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Amazing place, but seriously, the portions are huge!  Make sure you come with friends so you can share the meals."
4382,Hash House A Go Go,4,"What is the opposite of Tapas?  This place!  I went for the Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. I could only eat a 1/4 of it sans the carbs.  It was really interesting that I could taste each of the items and could mix and match.  I thought the chicken was good even though I took most of the batter on it.  You have to try it and go with more people and share.  Trust me people = small village because that entre could feed a small village.  Enjoy it's Las Vegas"
4383,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you have a huge appetite, this is definitely the place to go!

I came here on new years eve for lunch.  There was a pretty long wait to be seated but it was well worth it!  As I was waiting to be seated, I looked at the menu and knew that I wanted to order the Sage fried chicken benedict... This dish did not disappoint!  It was a unique combination of amazing-ness all on one gigantic plate. A layer of mashed potatoes was topped with two big biscuits with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and spinach.  Then, the friend chicken sat on top of the biscuits.  The chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Chipotle sauce was poured on top, which covered the entire plate.  There is no way one person could finish this plate on their own (although they would want to).

I wish they had one of these restaurants in the Bay Area!"
4384,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Seriously, this place is heaven on earth... DO NOT LEAVE after you see the wait... it is WORTH IT! Wait the 45 min to an hour, you will not be disappointed. 

Definitely ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles... The waffles have bacon in them. Let me repeat myself...the WAFFLES have BACON in them.  It was seriously amazing.  My dad got the same thing as me, my mom had the Chicken Benedict... also phenomenal, and HUGE.  My sister isn't as much of an ""eater"" that we are, an d she opted for oatmeal with fruit... Well this was the biggest bowl of oatmeal I had EVER seen, and she was extremely satisfied. 

Don't plan on finishing your food here, because it would just be near impossible, but don't split your food, its part of the experience.  The drinks are awesome as well.  Do plan on having your camera, trust you are going to want to remember the moment you ate the largest plate of chicken and waffles you have ever seen! :)"
4385,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars. Took away a half star for the long, long wait.wait forever to get a table and then everything is cooked to order so...another long wait and we were starving. A bit hard to find, but loved the food. Atmosphere leaves a bit  to be desired and the wait staff tries really, really hard but even charm school probably wouldn't make a difference. Portions are outta control but plate lickin' good grub."
4386,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is amazing!!! So unique and delicious!

I was told about this place by a friend who couldn't stop raving about this place and they were right!! 

My husband had the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream scrambled eggs. The dish on Man vs Food. It was so good. The fried chicken was so crispy even through it's covered with this really yumm sauce. The bacon and cheese on top of that rich creamy sauce, it was so good. Best fried chicken I ever had.

I was trying to be a bit healthier than my husband so I got the Roasted Chicken, fresh corn, roasted pepper & mozzarella scrambles. It was so good, I think the corn was the best part, but overall it was the combination of the ingredients.

Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade is amazing!! Love the kiwi part :)

Also a warning - The Hash House A Go Go in San Diego is the original, but it not nearly as good. The ones in Vegas is much better!!!"
4387,Hash House A Go Go,2,"All hype.  Badly executed food.  Coffee is weak.  Food was all cold.  The potatoes were just like the ones they used to deep fry at my grade school cafeteria, were underseasoned and tasted even worse cold.  Hash, which if it's in the place's name you'd think would be good, was big but tasted so boring I almost went back to sleep.  The spongy vanilla waffle was exactly like eating a twinkie without the cream filling.  I hate twinkies and think their only redeeming quality is the cream filling.   Oddly enough, the bacon was just plain old thin sliced bacon...cold.

Service was good, noise level was insane, wait wasn't bad at 20 minutes."
4388,Hash House A Go Go,3,Came here during our visit to Vegas this past weekend. The flavor was ok but the portion is huge. Each entree is big enough to share for 2-3 people. Don't over order like we did. I like the chicken fried steak the most out of all the entrÃ©es we ordered. If you like coffee you should try the nitro coffee which was recommended to us by our server
4389,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food was very good (I had biscuits and gravy). The portions are quite large. The service was friendly. Prices are typical for The Strip. 

However, there were two problems. A minor one was that when they called iur names to be seated, we waited 10 minutes for someone to show up with menus and seats is. 

The second problem was the 45-minute wait for our food. Basic breakfast stuff like eggs, etc.

I'd give it a second chance. But I was not happy."
4390,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was floored by the presentation!  Truly amazing staff, friendly and on the ball. Stores do differ in quality though.  Sad but true, if you have had a bad experience at one, definitely try another location!"
4391,Hash House A Go Go,4,"HUGE portions! This food is super greasy, sweet, and mega calorie bombs. It's a good morning after drinking breakfast/brunch. I believe they're open 24/7. I got the snickers flapjack and fried chicken benedict to share with my sister. It was pretty good especially for the sizes given! I probably should have just ordered one item to split with another person but I was feeling greedy. I'm not sure I'd go back since it was just an outrageous amount of food but I think everyone should give it a shot especially after drinking."
4392,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I give it 4 stars because the air conditioning wasn't working, it was super hot!!!

I had the avocado, onion and pepper egg scramble.  Very tasty, reminded me of guacamole and eggs!

Crispy potatoes had great flavor, and were even better with a little cholula.

Biscuit was dense but good, as was the sausage gravy!!!!

Would definitely recommend."
4393,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food here was surprisingly better then the Hash House on Sahara. I figured it would be the other way around but the food was actually alot better here.  Service on the other hand was not as good as the one on Sahara so i guess thats the trade off... lol
4394,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great experience here.  We took our family from out of country and wanted to have them try some American comfort foods.  

Food isn't amazing or the best by any means.  I would say it's average but the amount was great for everyone try and have enough food.  

Wouldn't come back ourselves but with a large group, it's a definitely a fun eating experience"
4395,Hash House A Go Go,4,The servings are huge! I tried one of their scrambles and was very pleased. I liked the blueberry preserves that came with the biscuit. Service was a bit slow.
4396,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for the Sage Fried Chicken Waffle Tower.  First time eating the entire day (it was approx. 12pm) and it was amazing.  I literally stuffed myself and I shared the dish with my husband.  Definitely worth trying it out.  We will be returning for sure on my next trip to Vegas.  Service was cool, no complaints."
4397,Hash House A Go Go,4,"With a room full of Robuchon gifts leftover our fourth day would have been an easy one to sleep in and eat breakfast in the room - but why do things easy when there are so many great places to dine in Las Vegas?  Despite my multiple trips to Sin City in the past I'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of ""twisted farm food"" - Hash House A Go-Go.  Having heard that a third (the other in San Diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the Imperial Palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.
 
With late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a HHAGG shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt Hash House does everything big.  Taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, Noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  Menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  Hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because ""oh man, we thought this was a buffet.""  Clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.
 
Sitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  With prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when I chuckled saying okay the response was ""you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it"" - clearly I'm jaded.  Sitting back and listening to Rock You Like a Hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.
 
Arriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  With a sweet, a savory, and a ""dessert"" there was too much food for four people.  Beginning first with the Blackberry Granola Flapjacks, my sister's choice although I'd lobbied for the Snickers Flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  With ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.

Perhaps the most famous Hash House dish would be my order - ""Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.""  Golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  Stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel I have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  While clearly not as subtle and refined as Bouchon's chicken and waffles I actually much preferred this to Roscoe's famous Los Angeles version and the less famous option at DC's Founding Farmers.

Our dessert would be Andy's famous Bread pudding topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  With the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this bread pudding is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  A portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  Buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted Snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  Like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.

Settling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had P.U.B. leftovers and the Robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to the door accompanied by Eddie Van Halen's Eruption.  Generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food Hash House A Go Go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good."
4398,Hash House A Go Go,3,Defenetely for the big appetite. The portions are huge. I could only get through one third of mine. The food though was not that tasty. Both my wife and I left feeling unsatisfied with the quality. On the other hand our waitress was simply amazing. Very friendly and so attentive
4399,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great portions  great service. Go see Travis he is the best he has a tall Mohawk you can't miss his if you can't remember his name. he had so many tables and was super on it. We seen him go to at least 6 or 7 tables! I am a server in a restaurant so I am a hard judge but he was great! Thanks Travis we shall see you next time we go to vegas!
4400,Hash House A Go Go,4,portions are crazy!!! so make sure u share!! food was super good for being so much too ... i will definitely make it back to try more...of course i'll have to go on a diet for like a month!! if i wanna eat here.... cause that's how much weight i'll probably gain back in one meal ...
4401,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had the Sage chicken and waffles. Waffles are stuffed with bacon slices. Comes with 2 chicken breast filets and 3 waffles. My daughter and I split it and had left overs... Chicken was so moist and the breading was crispy and flavorful.  We waited 45 minutes on a Sunday at 10am... Not bad. Worth it for sure! Had the butterscotch latte which was great, not too too sweet."
4402,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went again and is still good.  Added photos of the fried chicken Benedict and chicken pot pie. Chorizo scramble was off the hook (people still is that phrase or did I date myself).  Food coma!
Reminder. They have big portions so you may need to share a plate."
4403,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place gets pretty busy but the wait isn't so bad ! All the employees are very nice and he portions are huge for the prices ! I had leftovers and had them for breakfast lunch and dinner. The bloody Mary's are to die for !
4404,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Good ice tea.  Great show, of big plates to post on FB. Burger came out dry. My man vs food plate was a great show dish. But it was horrible. Bisects came out cold. I wouldn't come back"
4405,Hash House A Go Go,5,we went here 4 times in the 3 days we spent in vegas. the best place I have ever eaten at. you need to try it to believe it
4406,Hash House A Go Go,2,"From reading the reviews and seeing Hash House a Go Go on TV all the time, I was really excited to eat here.  

I ordered a regular bloody mary and the House-Smoked fresh salmon, cream cheese and scallions hash.  The bloody mary was really spicy and put my face on fire, but from whatever else my tastebuds could sense, it was good??  

When the hash came out, it looked absolutely gorgeous...then it went quickly downhill from there.  The waitress gave me a disclaimer that the smoked salmon wasn't lox and that it was hot-smoked salmon, which I was fine with, but it was completely dry and lacked any sort of smokiness.  It just tasted like crumbled, overcooked salmon.  The cream cheese helped add some depth to the flavor, but it was just lumped in there.  The potatoes were also flavorless.  This dish really needed some seasoning or some kind of sauce to pour over the whole thing.  The biscuit was good though!  

I'd like to think I just ordered the wrong thing and I'm naive enough to come back and try something else.  But, my advice to all of you...don't get the smoked salmon hash!"
4407,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food - awesome selection of ingredients - and superb service. Ate here twice on consecutive days - my best breakfast experience in Las Vegas!

Highly recommend it!"
4408,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was pretty good. Like some other people posted we were told the wait would 45 minutes but we were in within 30. A lot of people make reservations and then leave (dumb). They only call your name once and expect you to be ready to sit so don't go back down the escalator and miss the call. Food came out a bit slow but portions are good but not all of the them are overbearing. We ordered the Tractor Driver Combo which was scrambled eggs, potatoes and a buttermilk pancake the size of a pizza (very good), and The Basic which was 2 eggs, potatoes and veggies, (again very good). The Bloody Mary was bit spicy. Food was good and wait not as bad as expected. Waiter was quick and attentive. Definitely worth going to more than once."
4409,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Always a great time at Hash House! The -1 star is for the inconvenience and crowdedness that makes you feel uncomfortable.  Hope to god there is not a wait outside in the waiting area, that means you're going to be waiting a long time! Same day reservations are not accepted, as well as weekend dates.  So plan to arrive early to beat the crowds! Other than that, LOVE the food.  LOVE the presentation.   Great place to eat and large portions to take home leftovers with!   Absolutely love the biscuits with their house made jellies.  Varies depending on the day. I visit Hash House in San Diego and Las Vegas whenever I'm visiting either city."
4410,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was the highlight of our trip to Vegas! The service was good and friendly. Any questions that we had about the menu our waiter helped to answer and gave us recommendations of what he liked. The prices were LOW for how much food we got and how amazing and tasty the quality was. We had so many leftovers because we were SO FULL! I am so happy that we waited for a table, even though the wait was a bit long. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in Vegas!"
4411,Hash House A Go Go,3,"With only a few hours of sleep, we were hungry and looking for brunch. After watching so much Food Network and Cooking Channel through the years, I suggested to try Hash House A Go Go which is located at The Quad Resort & Casino. 
I was a bit worried walking up to restaurant to see a crowd of people waiting to get seated. The good thing was that people were constantly leaving and people waiting were being seated. The wait was about 20 minutes. 
This place is known for their sage fried chicken, leeks, and waffles which goes for $15.99. The menu says it's a New York Times favorite. This dish comes with two crispy pieces of boneless chicken, fried leeks, and 4 pieces of thick waffles, and maple syrup. Waffles were a bit extra-ordinary such that they had whole pieces of bacon cooked inside of each one, however, I didn't care for it too much. I like my waffles a bit on the thinner side. It seemed as if I needed to drench my waffles to get some flavor in them. The bacon inside didn't enhance the flavor. The chicken on the other hand was pretty good. Not great but good. I was so hungry that I ate both pieces of chicken and 3 out of the 4 waffles. Trust me, those were big portions, but honestly, I'd rather have Roscoe's than Hash House A Go Go's chicken & waffles.  
Anyways, it's worth a try. Service here was friendly and attentive."
4412,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Chicken and waffles, OMG too large! Too much, yet soooo yummy.
Service was ok! No line when we came in on a saturday night!"
4413,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for a 1pm breakfast on July 25th 2014 with a friend. We were hung over and starving for some breakfast. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait and that we should stay close because it could be sooner since people miss the call for their tables. We ended up only waiting 15-20 minutes and we were able to get some good screwdrivers while we waited. The menu was very unique for my tastes but I ordered the sage chicken. We were told it would be about another 45 minute wait for our food after we ordered. It didn't take that long, maybe 30 minutes maximum. Our waiter forgot to bring my friends drink and took some effort to flag him down to ask about the drink, but he returned with the drink promptly once we were able to flag him down. The food was delicious and the price was very reasonable for the amount of food. I couldn't finish all my food, which is very rare. The waiter brought us jam, butter, and honey at our our request, no questions asked and no wait. I would go here for breakfast over a cheap breakfast buffet everyday if the wait was a little shorter and i wasn't in a hurry to lose more money. I will definitely try to come here every time i come to Vegas."
4414,Hash House A Go Go,2,First of all long wait time. Second to much food like who can eat all that!!!! It's suck a waste of food! I felt bad leaving so much food to waste plus it was like a mixture of bacon mash potatoes tomatoes like a big salad of food nasty.... am sure it was good but put all in one was nasty. PLEASE STOP SERVING SO MUCH FOOD ... it's a sin to throw away food
4415,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome place 
You get what you pay for!! That's forsure 
They were super busy but they made it super fast"
4416,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome food for a great price!!! Don't be fooled these plates are HUGE!!! Could not finish but it was so worth the half hour wait! Must go when In Vegas!
4417,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Woke up HANGRY. So I went to where they said was a great breakfast. Took a minute to find it. It is on the second floor of the LINQ Casino. We go in and are seated quickly. Nice waitress comes up and gives us a menu. I asked her what she recommended. ""Chicken and Waffles"". But get this she said the waffles have BACON in them. Yea!!!  She said bacon!  So you already know I got THAT!!!  
Now when I tell you that they came out with a plate piled high with chicken and waffles I mean they came out with a plate piled high. (See the attached picture). 
I could only eat a little more than half of it, but let me tell you whoever came up with this dish with bacon in the waffle goes on my great invention list along side the person who invented air conditioned seats in my Cadillac!  That's what's up with that!!!"
4418,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The sister and I were looking for a brunch place to stop in and found this place on yelp. The line was crazy long. We waited over an hour before we got ourselves a booth. We took this as a good sign for some good eating. Our server was very friendly and funny. He took care of us well even though it was a full house.

CRISPY SALMON- fresh salmon cornmeal friend on a wheat bun with lettuce, tomato, and red onion all trimmed with chili mayo, served with fries
The sister ordered this and I was disappointed with the way it tasted. It was bland. The salmon was overcooked and dried. I was hoping for it to retain its moisture, but sadly it was so dry and flavorless that one bite was enough for me. The fries weren't flavored nor were they crisp. Overall this dish was a disappointment and disgusting.

GRIDDLED FRENCH TOAST- dipped in a banana cinnamon cream with pecans and maple syrup, served with eggs and potatoes
The french toast was a bit chewy and didn't have much flavor on its own, but when eaten with the banana there was some sweetness.  The potatoes were dry and unseasoned, but liked that they didn't overcook the eggs. The cinnamon cream was my favorite part of the whole dish. It was light and creamy.

I'm going to give this place a second try because it was crazy packed and I know people don't stand in line for mediocre food. I will be returning and ordering other things. Don't fail me again!"
4419,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Seriously, what's better than drunchies at a good ole classic diner that KNOWS how to do breakfast?? 

Service is always polite, fast, & helpful. Open 24/7. Been here a handful of times and it's my go-to spot now for food in Vegas!! Me and my girlfriends love this, might be funny but you can't deny yourself some hearty food and this place knows that size matters. Like the portions are insane!!! Definitely worth the wait, price, and everything. 

Gotta experience Hash House y'all"
4420,Hash House A Go Go,1,"In a word, Overrated! We were seated in a back room, no ventilation, food and service sucked. The worst part, it was expensive for a basic, albeit large, breakfast."
4421,Hash House A Go Go,4,So glad we made brunch reservations because the line was out the door! We were 10 minutes early and seated promptly. The menu is overwhelming so I went with ham and eggs and a brown sugar banana pancake. My husband ordered the corn beef hash plate. Good came out super quick and hot. My ham and eggs was delicious and thank pancake is to die for! The corn beef hash could have been cooked more and I think it would have been a lot better without the Swiss cheese. Our server Scott was great. He had good energy and was very personable. Every request we made from the kitchen - he was on it! The plates here are huge it's more then enough food to share and is great food for the price. We would have taken our leftovers to go but didn't have a microwave in our hotel room.
4422,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions for a good price! :) Ordered the chicken and waffles, as well as the salmon benedict. The food came pretty fast and the presentation was so pretty.

Four girls shared two large orders and it was good to fill us all up :)

WIll be back to check out other items off their menu."
4423,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed the Hash House. While waiting to be sat, we had drinks at the bar. Service was great & attentive.  I ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs. It was beyond huge & very delicious.  Husband ordered the chicken Benedict & it too was equally huge & tasty.  Our only regret is there isn't a Hash House in Fort Worth! We'll return on the next vegas visit."
4424,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I became a fan of Hash House after visiting the Sahara Avenue location with some of the fam. We had a car, so we decided to go off the strip to eat. I was super excited to find out that they were opening one along the Strip at Imperial Palace.

The wait isn't too bad. Kinda slacking on the Diamond Members though. We thought we'd get faster service, but we seemed to keep getting pushed back. If you're going to have a separate Diamond Members line, then cater to it PLEASE.

My usual here is the Brown Sugar Banana Flapjack. DELICIOUSSSSS!!!!! :D I love getting this. My sweet tooth gets the best of me. Maybe order something non-sweet on the side when you need a ""break,"" haha. Maybe some eggs & sausage...or something. 

The portions are HUGEEEE!!! I love it. Totally can share too, but there's a sharing cost. 

Wait for food takes awhile..so do NOT go there starving. Make sure you have something in your stomach already &/or be prepared to wait awhile for food. 

LOVE this place. Can't wait to go again :)"
4425,Hash House A Go Go,5,I am a San Diego native and have missed this place since I left home for work. It's great to see them growing and I'm glad to have them here!
4426,Hash House A Go Go,4,"5 Minute wait to get a table. Wow!

Really really good food!

Really really long wait to get your food. imagine 45-1 hour! Aaargh!!

This restaurant is inside the Imperial Palace Hotel and came highly recommended by the concierge.

I ordered the Flap Jack blueberries and pecan. It came in a huge plate! With huge portions. Really! I can't  even take a picture of the whole plate. I FORGOT MY WIDE LENS! it's that big!

 It's a sin to eat that much! But it's Vegas! Excessive to a degree!

I waddled when i walked out of there!"
4427,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was awesome we ordered the chicken and waffles it is huge so it is good for two. Prices are reasonable. The reason why I gave them a 4 star is because I ordered a smores mocha and they gave it to me until after almost finishing my food. Which was a bummer because I want it together with my food. Other than that everything was amazing. Customer service, food, the place is cool too."
4428,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food was good but the portions were gigantic! You could easily split most of the dishes our table ordered. I like their approach with the food and the fact that they try to elevate standard dishes.
4429,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Walked by and saw this place for breakfast. Says the best pancakes. I'm a big pancake fan.

The pancakes was probably the biggest I have seen. However, it wasn't fluffy and the syrup was fake which didn't go over well. The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was impressive and tasted great.

Also, mimosas were super and came in a fun netted stocking leg of a glass.

Fun place to bring friends..if you're a die hard pancake fan--there are better spots on the strip."
4430,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had to check this place out for breakfast since we were in the area.  The portions are ridiculous and that's usually the draw based on all the press I've seen about this place.  It's conveniently located on the second floor of the Linq and prepare to wait as there are always crowds of people waiting to be seated.  Although, there seems to be a lot of hype over this place, I just really didn't see what was so great.  The eggs I ordered as part of my breakfast were average and the bacon wasn't that great.  It came with one of their signature biscuits, which was a bit dry in my opinion.  Overall, glad I got to experience it, but not somewhere I'd probably go back."
4431,Hash House A Go Go,5,"WARNING: LONG WAIT TIMES

Hash House A Go Go is located upstairs in the Linq casino. The wait time is ridiciously long. We were quoted anywhere from 45 mintues to 1.5 hours, but luckily you're in Vegas, so you can just walk around. Just be sure to get back early so you don't miss your name. They should really implement a texting feature.

Despite the wait time, this is one of the best places to get breakfast on The Strip. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. The sage flavor gives the chicken a delicious twist and eating that plus the waffles drenched in maple syrup is amazing. My wife ordered the Snickers pancake. She really enjoyed it. The pancake was humongous and there were a ton of pieces of Snickers in the batter.

Overall, it was an amazing experience. It is definitely worth the wait!"
4432,Hash House A Go Go,5,"There was a really, really long wait for this place, so be prepared for that. However, I will say that it was definitely worth the wait! Normally when people are willing to wait an hour, you know the place is poppin'. I got the chicken hash, and it was really delicious! The hash browns were probably the best I've ever had, and all of the vegetables that were in the hash were cooked perfectly! The atmosphere in this place was really nice, and so was our server. It seems kind of pricey, for a broke college kid, but the portions they give you are huge! I'd definitely go back, if I ever return to Vegas."
4433,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Our server Katie was very knowledgable on the menu, she gave us some recommendations on the favorites. 

I ordered the HH meatloaf and the BF got the #5 burger. The portions are really big. I ate probably only a quarter of the entree and had to take the rest home. They bring out biscuits before your meal. 

Delicious."
4434,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Such generous portions. For 6 girls we ordered 4 items and still had so much food left over. Our server was very informative and very attentive. It was crazy busy there. Estimated time was 35-45 mins, we only had to wait 25mins. Super pleased with the service and food. The brown sugar pancakes are delish. Country fried chicken and gravy was fantastic. This a must go to breakfast spot."
4435,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Once you make your way through The Imperial Palace (YUCK!!) and all the smoke and side shows you can sit down and forget what lies beneath you. Hash House is soooo worth me venturing through A Princess Bride type movie that is this hotel. Try everything, so go multiple times.  EXCELLENT FOOD!"
4436,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The portions are HUGE and the prices are very reasonable.  The food was really tasty.  We were quoted a 90 minute wait, but it took less than 30 minutes to be seated."
4437,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Prepare for a food coma! The food was awesome and came in generous portions. Let me clarify, their plates can easily feed 2-3 people. I had the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles with a side of biscuits and gravy. Very well cooked and seasoned. Service was great and the menu is fairly priced."
4438,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Large portions of tasteless food. That sums up my experience there. I ordered chicken and waffles, my other dining companions ordered 2 different popular dishes and we all came up with the same synopsis.  I also ordered their popular Mocha, again tasteless, watered down mocha. At least they are consistent. I was so excited to try this place. It was such a let down. My fried chicken was so carelessly under seasoned, my s'more mocha( another one of their so called special dishes) that I can only come to the conclusion that no one really cares there. I'm sorry to be harsh, but there is no other conclusion. The only reason I gave them two stars is because if you are someone that needs a lot of fat food and  flavor is not that much of a big deal, you'll like it here.  Sorry HH"
4439,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food in enormous portions. You can't go wrong eating here. 

Be prepared for a wait on the weekends."
4440,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I came here on a recommendation for a reasonably priced breakfast place in Vegas. It was a bonus that there is a location in the Quad hotel. 

When arriving my girlfriend and I were told that there was a 35-45 minute wait. However, it was a pleasant surprise to get seated within 15 minutes.

Our server (also a bartender) brought coffee and water immediately. He did an excellent job throughout the meal. 

The food was amazing. I had the fried chicken Benedict and it was enormous. It could definitely be shared by two (or more) people. I did my best to finish it but alas I failed.

The entree consisted of two homemade biscuits a fried chicken breast, two poached eggs, cheese and Benedict sauce. Whoa! 

Looking forward to my next experience when I return to Las Vegas.

Two thumbs up!"
4441,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Worst service ever, i never complain about anything but this time it just needs to be told the way it is. Waiting is waiting fine, waited for my name to be called got a table and ordered our drinks and food we were ready to go. Guess what never got our drinks had to ask another waiter. Got our drinks i had coffee and it wasnt even hot. My buddy got his plate first then waited another 15 till my other buddy got his chicken salad, i mean how long does it take take to make a salad. Never was asked if i wanted more coffee while waiting for my food both my buddies finnished there food and i still had no chicken and waffles. Two guys that came in after us got there food before me and i waved the waiter and said wheres my food and he was like let me check. Came back and he was like it will be right there, so I said you know what i dont want it anymore. So as we are waiting for my buddy to come back from the restroom the cook comes out with my plate and he was like chicken and waffles and i was like i dont want that anymore and i told him that i have been waiting for about an hour and people that were waiting before us got there food first. My buddy paid the bill for there bills they shouldnt of even been charged for having me wait for our food and drinks and bringing the food out at total diffrent times. I always bring new people to the Hash House but never again."
4442,Hash House A Go Go,3,Food is amazing here. Their biscuits are to die for. Been for breakfast twice and did not disappoint either time. Always super busy. Had to wait 45 min to get seated. Right inside the linq- pretty easy to find. Take the escalator/stairs up to the restaurant. Only giving 3 stars because of the service. Server up sold us on gravy. My boyfriend and I each ordered breakfast and she asked if we wanted gravy to go with it. We both said yes. Little did we know how large the gravy cups were going to be and that it was $4.25/$4.50 a piece. One gravy would've been fine for the two of us. It's not about the money just be informative while serving. It seemed as though she was trying to up sell us to get a larger tip which actually backfired on her because we tipped less than we would have if she had just been up front about it.
4443,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband and I ate here last night, it was so different and creative the way  they stacked the food. It was also great tasting with excellent service from our waiter Andrew."
4444,Hash House A Go Go,2,"the best part of this whole experience was going with a huge group of mid westerners. you know, the kind that wear hunting camouflage hats as daily wear and just went hunting a few days ago. we talked about bow hunting and cooking deer. i felt like an adopted asiatic in the bunch. me with my heels, nails and err, non bloody hobbies. the food was HUGE, i ate a quarter of my double stuffed burger with fries. the whole thing was stabbed with a steak knife and rosemary sprig. btw rosemary bites with hamburger is nummy. 
my pseudo family member ordered a pork loin benedict dish that was a huuuuge beach ball radius sized breaded pork on a mattress of mashed potatoes, he ate 3/4's and fell into zombie mode. 
so for shock value, to feed a family of four or play with your food one dish will suffice. for flavors alone...meh."
4445,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is inside the casino...  walking down the ""alley"" toward the ferris wheel thing won't get you there.  Staff here was amazing.  As you'll see from photos, the serving sizes are obnoxiously large...  the kids meal we got was only $6 and also huge.  We ordered the meatloaf sandwich and a chicken pasta.  Both were huge, but neither was super-delicious.  They were both just okay.  
The fried chicken was good and they served HUGE biscuits before the meal.
We got everything to go, asked for plastic silverware and gave it to some thankful homeless.  We had no way to eat leftovers ourselves but didn't want it to go to waste.
I would come back.  Prices were decent, location (once you find it) is pretty convenient.  I wouldn't order the same thing."
4446,Hash House A Go Go,5,Exactly what you'd expect. Huge portions of yummy food. Mine came out cold but our server took care of it crazy fast and it was awesome the second try! I got the sage chicken and my husband got chocolate chip pancakes. Pro tip: get there before 10. We got seated immediately but when we left there were literally at least 100 people waiting for tables.
4447,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You know a place is delicious when you go there twice the same day. That's right. We started the day here in the morning and ended the day here late at norther chicken and waffles are amazing, out of this world good. I seriously had to force myself to eat it all since there was no way to take leftovers with me and surprising enough i wasn't bloated... We went again after Recycled Percussion's show(amazing show btw) and we split the waffles between 2. I didn't have the egg Benedict so i cant review on it."
4448,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here for a quick dinner on our last night in Vegas.  I had heard great things about Hash House A Go Go, and decided to give it a try.  This location is conveniently located next to the casino floor in LINQ.  

We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and Warm Spinach Salad.  The chicken benedict was average, the portion was predictably huge, but the mess of food on the plate was hit or miss.  I personally liked the soft scrambled eggs, super creamy and perfectly cheesy.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing I liked on the plate.  Both the chicken the potatoes were dry and bland.  It was a really disappointing dish.  Meanwhile, the salad felt comically small compared to the behemoth of the benedict (I wish I took a side by side photo).  I wasn't a big fan of the vinaigrette, and the red onion to spinach leaves ratio was off, leaving the salad overpowered by the onions.  

I would've probably given two stars for the food, but pumped it up to three due to the super attentive service.  Our server was helpful and quick to fulfill any additional requests.  I asked if I could take my leftover ice tea to go, and he came out with a fresh cup of ice tea for me.  

Overall, even though the large portions provided a good value for a quick meal on the strip, there are so many other great places in the area that this is not worth a stop."
4449,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.

My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.

Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?

I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.

I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.

I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!

The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.

The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!

Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!"
4450,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you're looking for comfort food in big portions, this is the place to go. Don't be impressed with it's location, because it's in Imperial Palace, lol. 

The wait is pretty commonly standard, 30 minutes for a group of 8.  

I had chicken and waffles.  Don't expect Roscoes, but expect MASSIVE presentation. I loved the chicken because it was chicken breast, perfectly breaded and fried.  And you can't go wrong with waffles!!! 

As for my drink, I did pretty ""gangsta,"" Bud in a brown paper bag, that's how they give it!

If you're hungover and craving a good hardy dish, this is the place to go!"
4451,Hash House A Go Go,4,I like their chicken waffles. Especially on Tuesday!! Its half the prices which is awesome. The portions are also crazy huge which is a bonus since they are kinda pricy!
4452,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We came here based on reviews, but were incredibly disappointed. They say that they are famous for their buttermilk sage fried chicken, so we wanted to try it. The chicken breasts had multiple chunks of fat on them, which is just gross when you bite into them. So, they can't be bothered to trim the chicken before frying it? The biscuits that came with the meal were dry and tasteless, even though they were covered in melted butter and honey. So basically, we received huge piles of terrible food!! We were sick to our stomachs for the rest of the evening. We had the remainder of our meal boxed up, which we gave to a hungry homeless person on the strip! It was just gross...don't bother!"
4453,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Service was very good. I did experience a service failure and the way it was handled was exceptional. My food came out and the chicken was luke warm, granted I did request something different with the meal that could have made for a longer wait in the window. The server immediately took my food to be refired once he was informed. The manager came right afterward to get an understanding of the situation. Everything was resolved immediately. Not only that, the server did not once let it affect our experience. The server continued to offer an above and beyond memory that I will take with me when dining at other outlets. Thank you!"
4454,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food porn!  This place is awesome!  I went for brunch and everything was amazingly delicious including our waiter Gary.  

I started off my meal with one of the best bloody Mary's that I've ever had.  It was perfectly spicy with jalapeÃ±o stuffed olives.

The sage chicken and waffles were yummmmmmy!  The chicken was tender, juicy and crispy.  The waffles had bacon in them!!  Awesome!

I also recommend the chorizo and jalapeÃ±o hash.  It wasn't too spicy.  It had delicious potatoes, egg, tomato, chorizo and peppers served on a cast iron skillet.  My only issue is it could have been warmer.

Overall this place is awesome.  The portion sizes are massive. The average wait for a table on a Sunday morning was about 20 mins.  The service was friendly and pretty quick.  I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
4455,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is amazing and they give alot!  Very crowded had to wait over and hour but worth the wait.  This was on the food network thats why we check them out...  I have told friends when they go to vegas to check it out and everyone that did.. said thanks that place was awesome...  you wont be disappointed..  As busy as they are the food was terrific worth the wait!
4456,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is a must go too place. I went for breakfast I thought I was hungry until I got my food and OMG they should babe this place the House with big food  it was great it was like 3 meals in one day for me. Great food and I couldn't stop taking pics on the way up the escalated beautiful.
4457,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I dunno. I want to love this place, I do. I love the concept, the atmosphere, the GINORMOUS portions and even the staff was super friendly! But, I dunno, really, all it comes down to is the food. And it was just meh for me.

I got the fried sage chicken with mashed potatoes, eggs, biscuits. The food wasn't hot, it was lukewarm, a turn off already. The biscuits were good but not anything I couldn't have gotten from KFC. Mashed potatoes were meh, whatever. And the chicken was just meh too, neither crispy nor soggy - a weird in between and flavor wasn't bland it was just again, whatever.

I also got the pistachio mocha, which at first tasted soooo bitter!!! But once I stirred everything together it was quite delightful and had a hint of pistachio flavor, which I loved especially cause I'd never had anything like it. 

Price: A
Potion: A+
Service: A
Atmosphere: B
Taste: B-/ C"
4458,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this restaurant. It's my first time at this location, but the menu is the same at all of them. Giant American sized portions of food, loud music, and crazy menu combinations such as snickers pancakes,   chicken and waffle towers and man vs food challenges. I had the tractor combo with french toast and my boyfriend had the meatloaf hash.  They were both excellent. Our server was the lovely Louisa. She was very nice and smart. I ordered a chicken sausage and she told me the casing was pork. Most servers don't think that far ahead to tell a customer whose ordering chicken sausage that it contains pork, because obviously they don't want pork sausage or they wouldn't go out of their way to order chicken. 

She also told us how long the ticket times were, which I've never had a server do in a casual restaurant. What a great idea! That way, you're not sitting & thinking with a stink eye that they forgot about your order because it's taking a while. We really liked her service very much. If you're hungry, this is the spot. My boyfriend is a big eater, and he was defeated. This location is open 24/7 as well, so you're never lost on getting your giant food fix!"
4459,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG ! This place is out of control. The food excellent, the service awesome, and location ? Well let's just say I walked past it before being redirected by a friendly security guard who politely told me to turn around and look up at the sign on the ceiling. Okay it was a long night at the TI beforehand. Overall this place is great. Now I know there is one in San Diego, we'll be there. Next time we will share plates due to the outrageous portions on their platters. That's right, not plates but platters. I had my favorite biscuits and gravy with eggs and mashed potatoes, enough to feed a small army. Others in our party had pancakes, of which they offer several different kinds from classic buttermilk to snickers bar, and the Andy Sage's fried chicken plate. Not a complaint in the group of ten, except not being able to finish. Can't say enough except bring a group to share with and a huge appetite."
4460,Hash House A Go Go,1,Food was over hyped and nothing special.  THE WAITRESS STOLE MY CARD AND FORGED MY SIGNATURE AND CHARGED MY CARD FOUR TIMES!! After speaking with management they acted like they didn't care and would not even comp a drink or meal for my troubles.
4461,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My favorite Las Vegas spot! Huge portions, great prices, great tasting food and friendly service. If you get there during the day you may have a long wait, but late nights provide quick seating while everyone else is partying. I still have my souvenir glass and use it everyday! I love this place!"
4462,Hash House A Go Go,5,This flap jack was soo good and also HUGE!! Service was friendly and it didn't take too long to get the food either. Will def go again!
4463,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First thing I will say is this wasn't really worth the wait. I ordered the chicken and waffles, so I expected something along the taste of Roscoe's, but this taste more like it had a Asian infusion. It wouldn't be bad if that was what I wanted. My boyfriend got the waffle plate and that was alright. The syrup here is not sweet at all and that was the major deal breaker.

The portion size is definitely worth the price. I would recommend sharing a plate if you guys want something similar. No need to waste money. 

I would give this place another shot because too many people come here for it to just be okay. I think I may have just got the wrong thing, but for now it was just okay."
4464,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Large portions and good quality food. We stopped for brunch, I had The Tractor Driver Breakfast with French Toast. The French toast was excellent. The pancakes are huge and very tasty. Bloody Mary was very good as well. I'm glad we decided to go. Our group got there at 8:30 and got in quickly. When we were leaving at 9:30 there was a lot of people waiting to get in. Everyone in our group was glad we chose this resturant."
4465,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love their breakfast. You HAVE to get the French toast. You won't be sorry. Love the fresh squeezed orange juice, too!"
4466,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I really wish I would have read the reviews before I came because the other 2 people at my table could have all shared one plate of food! We came here after a morning of roulette and the wait was about 30 minutes on a Thursday around 10am. It was pretty busy but it was fun looking at the wall of famous people who have been to here to eat. When we sat down, our waiter came over immediately to get our drinks. I was so overwhelmed looking at the menu, I really wanted to try it all! 

I ended up getting the sage fried chicken and waffles, my fiance ordered the Andy's fried chicken benedict and my dad got the cobb salad. Oh man, the portion of all the entrees were crazy. I had no idea how big they were until we ordered and we started seeing the waiters bring it out to other tables. My fried chicken was very delicious and juicy. I loved the bacon waffles..I mean anything with bacon is good. I really liked the chicken benedict also, the sauce that comes with it with the mash potatoes is perfect. I demolished my fiance's mash potatoes. I only could eat one waffle and one chicken...it was huge. The cobb salad was also huge, it probably could have fed a family of 5. 

After the meal, you definitely have to walk a couple miles to get rid of a piece of fried chicken. It was worth the $10-$15 an entree.  I will be sure that next time I go, I'll probably have to share with people at my time because it ended up being a waste of food since I couldn't finish it and my hotel didn't have a frig/microwave. Overall, the service was great and food was delicious. Will for sure come back next time."
4467,Hash House A Go Go,4,Honest review with nothing to be ashamed of. We ate here during our stay and literally stumbled in. I think we looked at the menu...maybe not?! neither of us remember!?  I'm guessing to the staff we were another couple drunks but we were looking for a great drunk dinner. I guess I got some type of burger(guess because all that was left in the to go box was half of each bun).  My wife had chicken and waffles and believes they were good.  We know this was ordered due to left overs.  The chicken I can say was good because I finished it the next day recovering from a hangover. After thinking more about it I'm thankful the staff didn't call the authorities or we may have ended up in detox.  A couple days later we walked by and took a sober look at things and they look to be good. A solid 4 star for not having us arrested and put in the drunk tank. Some day I hope to update with a sober review but I think you would like especially if you're black out drunk and want to end up walking the strip and meet a random polish guy before reviewing your pictures the next day to piece your night together!!
4468,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Just a warning: the quantity of food there was HUGE!!! It's the biggest size of dish I've ever had! The taste was good but not impressive. Service was good as well. Looks really popular, long line up when we're there."
4469,Hash House A Go Go,5,Rode to Vegas again and lucky staying right next to Linq.  Great food at the Hash House. Tasty and portions good for hunger.  Found the one on Sahara a few years ago and go back there each time in town.   Vegas Bike Feat in October usually stay downtown.  Plaza has one too.  All good
4470,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I don't have too much to say about this place as I try to stay away from this kind of food. Hash House A Go Go is known for their giant portion sizes so I highly recommend sharing a plate. The food tastes good but I wouldn't recommend it if you like to eat healthy. It had that after hours drunk food feel to it, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Again, the food tasted great and I had a positive experience. Great service, quickly seated, and open late. Didn't leave a huge impression on me but was fun to try."
4471,Hash House A Go Go,5,Chicken and waffles are awesome huge portions.  Great Bloody Mary's too.
4472,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait for a table is super long and the wait to get your food is even longer.  Seriously, takes almost an hour from the time you order your food unti you get it and they let you know up front it's going to be that way.  If you can manage to wait that long, the food is really good.  Sage Fried Chicken Breast & Waffles was amazing.  I loved it.  I also tried the Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin and it was really good.  I don't normally like pork but this was really great.  The pancakes were delicous as well.  I got the one with bananas in it.  Like everyone else said the servings are ginormous.  I also really liked the jam that's on the table.  It's damn good jam.  If you can manage to wait forever for your food, I recommend it but it takes an eternity."
4473,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Uhhh...someone is late in the hash house a go go. We dined in with 2 other couples after speed drinking in one of the pods at the high roller. Lol. They needed to sober up before the drive home and recommended this would be the spot.

While the food is not cheap eats, it's certainly more than you can eat unless you're a big eater...no seriously...like a big eater. 1 plate can easily be shareable between 2 people if you just want something to eat without being too stuffed and are trying to be budget conscious. I was wowed at every dish passing by us, and the dishes placed before us.

I'll be honest, it was late at night so I just got my usual Caesar salad. It was a small side order and that was 7.99. While I was hoping for the price they'd hook it up, but since it was the side Caesar salad, obviously not. Most importantly, it was certainly one of the better Caesar salads I've had in a restaurant! Thoroughly enjoyed it and my fatassness aside, it really was a good side dish portion.

The husband ordered their meatloaf. We don't even eat meatloaf, but it read of something he wanted to try. Two thick stacks of meatloaf with mashed potatoes in between...which btw, their mashed potatoes were so dang deelish! I've never had cheese broiled over mashed potatoes, or at least that's what I think was broiled over it...lol...and that made me look at mashed potatoes in a whole new world. Anyway, I took a bite of the hubs meatloaf and couldn't really tell you how good it was because I don't have anything to compare it against so I thought it was alright. But...the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes...even better!!!! It also is plated with steamed carrot sticks and green beans which I ate off. Those were cook fairly good as well. Carrots just had too much black pepper for my liking.

But honestly, that biscuit with syrup or honey or combo of both or whatever that sticky madness drizzled over it they serve to you before anything else comes out....is why you should try this spot out to begin with! Giant biscuits cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth yumness. 

We didn't try their famous waffles and chicken, but we did see it go by and there is no denying that hash house a go go...is a go. Everything is clearly made to make you walk out of there with the ambition to run 3 miles, 200 situps, and 50 pushups or whatever it is your athletic side desires.

Our serve PJ was soooooo awesome and I wish he could be our server everywhere because he made our first time dining there fun. Hahahha. He has our kind of humor but never failing on his professionalism which is why I gave this particular place 5 stars. 

There are stairs and an escalator to get up there. I didn't notice an elevator, but I'm sure they have one. 

Highly recommend! Come with a hungry stomach or a drunk one. Ha! Definitely kid and stroller friendly! 

Enjoy!"
4474,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Arrived for breakfast with a party of two. The wait was about 20 min of course the place was packed . We had a nice server and was pretty attentive. 

Ordered the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and the French toast. The chicken sandwich was just Alright and the portions are smaller than what they used to be. The French toast was disgusting and soggy. 

Deducted one star for the nasty French toast and for the Quality of the food. Also deducted another star for the waiting area. the waiting area is such a fire hazard there were people standing in front of the stairs, on the stairs one of the escalators was broken going down and only the one going up was working .. there was so many people crammed in there waiting you couldn't move or breath and actually some lady fell down the stairs and hit her damn head on the sign because of it being so crowded. 

Prolly won't be back to this location or I might try another one downtown."
4475,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food. Good service. Not even too expensive considering the portions. Meatloaf and chicken Benedict are delicious.  Don't need a side dish since there is so much food.
4476,Hash House A Go Go,5,Had country fried chicken with bacon and mashed potatoes. It was amazing! Expect a wait but it's worth it. A little on the pricey side by my standards but not compared to other things on or near the strip.
4477,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First off let me say I love Hash House a Go Go!  On a mini vacation to San Diego we decided to try this place. I loved it, we all did (friends, hubby).  
Now originally we did not have planned to eat here on our trip to Vegas.  I wanted to order room service for breakfast on Sunday morning but then lo and behold a commercial comes on advertising Hash's awesome ginourmous pancakes!! 
We said we gotta have that so scratch relaxing breakfast in comfy bed and off we go.
This Hash House is located in the Imperial Palace Hotel, which is really hard to find parking in.  So we finally park and find ourselves finally in the hotel and start looking for the place.  We went around in circles, probably like 4 times.  Kept seeing the advertisement for Hash but no clear directions to the restaurant. 
Finally we decide to walk through the Casino, I ask one of the workers where it is, she isn't very friendly but tells me some general directions through her teeth, which in the end didn't even help us! GRRR
Anywho, we go up the wrong escalator go back down and then i see a sign that sees go to the middle of the casino, so there we go and we finally go up the escalator and make it to our destination...YAY!! I was hungry!
There is a wait, but it wasn't too long.  We finally sit down, get some drinks.  I was a bit disappointed because i ordered a champagne super nova and like ten minutes later they tell me sorry no fresh mint.. so I go for coffee. 
We order, we eat, and we chill.  The food was great,  the service was a bit slow but they were pretty busy. All in all it was a good experience but next time I will go to the one on Sahara."
4478,Hash House A Go Go,2,Had a family breakfast the one in Henderson poor service food cold and hard and grease filled. Never again
4479,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I guess in comparison with some other options, this is not too terrible.  But it's not for us.  Went solely because we were in the hotel, hungry, and yelp had decent reviews. Should've read them more closely.  We got a table quickly and browsed their 'specialties' and picked the meatloaf.  We haven't had homestyle food for awhile.  The salad we ordered was a good value and tasty.  Then the meatloaf that we were sharing arrived.  It DEFIES DESCRIPTION.  The meatloaf is like no other -- hard, dense, and dry.  This is a specialty?  It is piled up with a conglomeration of strange things and a pile of mashed potatoes.  Food for three people on one plate.  None of it worked well together and the meatloaf was very disappointing.  We should've sent it back. The waitress asked if we liked it and we initially said it's very different and we can't decide.  She specifically never came back until she quickly dropped off our bill."
4480,Hash House A Go Go,5,I looked through reviews and I saw this place had great ratings. It was pretty early for a Friday and this place was already packed. Nonetheless since I was in town on biz I was on my own and didn't need a big table so I chose to sit at the counter with other stranded business folk so I got a seat right away. We were immediately treated by Koti. She was super patient when I was describing my elaborate drink request. She made the perfect vodka/champagne/lemonade concoction for me and it was good! I had one of the scrambles which was super tasty and the biscuit was top notch and there was homemade preserves to accompany it (which is made fresh daily). Great breakfast and Koti my server was awesome. I have a few more days on my layover so I'll prob be back tomorrow for any early breakfast!
4481,Hash House A Go Go,4,Went after coming from Drai's nightclub and seeing T.I. Warning the food portions are ridiculously huge so if you like to share with another person this would be a perfect place but if you have enough room to eat it all go for it! The food was very good and service was fast.
4482,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This Hash House is extremely rundown. The chairs at our table weren't level and they rocked back and forth. This is a a completely different atmosphere than the Hash House in Orlando (which looked and felt like a fancy restaurant). This location literally looked like a hybrid between a Denny's and a Texas Roadhouse. It was just not a very pretty sight and the clientele were visibly drunk. Service was good at first but once our food came out, our server literally vanished. Had to call out to her as she rushed by to get a refill on our drinks. Very disappointed by this HHAGG. Parking sucked but that has more to with Linq than HHAGG I guess."
4483,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Worst serving experience I've ever had. I, myself, had been a server for 3 years and I must say that there was no customer service in this restaurant besides the host and the gentleman that sat us. My boyfriend & I ordered waters and one pancake meal and a basic meal (eggs,sausage, toast). Now, I understand that graveyards can be difficult, it may be understaffed, & the kitchen may have issues.... BUT, if my server goes missing for 40 DAMN MINUTES without any communication, giving us updates, or even filling my damn water then there's a problem. I went to the bar to see if I could get refills there. Not once did the bartender at least acknowledge I was there and said he'd be right with me. Stood there for five minutes and decided maybe I'll go to the host and see if they can do my refills on water. No host was there. Then, I see my server and nor does she acknowledge me but makes a comment to herself ""the food's not out yet?"" No !!! It's not. Nor have you been out to check on your tables. (There were two more of her tables that did not seek attention for that duration either). I was too a point where I was just fed up so my boyfriend and I just left. Without food, without any water refills, nothing. Again, worst customer service I've EVER experienced. I mean if you're new ... Tell me! If there's issues in the damn kitchen ... Tell me ! Don't just ignore all your tables and then decide oh maybe I should see what's going on. To add, no manager in sight to even voice my issues. I love their food and have been here MANY times before but I don't think could ever eat here again. It's quite disappointing actually. If not, I'd stick to going in the mornings."
4484,Hash House A Go Go,2,"holy crap please dont' come here unless you know you have 2-3 hours to spend for dinner. the food was okay this time but seriously? an hour and a half wait just for some scrambled eggs?
seriously- eat before you come here to eat."
4485,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place serves pretty good food. Be prepared to wait a while for table. Unless you're a platinum total rewards member like myself. You can then skip to the front of the line. I was in Vegas for about 4 days and I came here 2 days in a row for brunch. There fried chicken is so moist and delicious. I also really enjoyed there pancakes. They are huge!!! 

Staff here are super friendly. Food does take a while to come out but I was prepared for that already after I read that at the bottom if the menu."
4486,Hash House A Go Go,5,This restaurant was amazing and exceeded all my expectations. At places like these I usually have an issue with the amount of sodium in the food but everything was so tasty and not salty for me at all we tried the chicken waffle tower and the eggs Benedict with the mashed potatoes on the bottom and bacon and red pepper sauce and everything was delicious and the portions were enormous definitely share one - unless you want to eat it for the next three days. Going to be a Vegas tradition for us
4487,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait was definitely worth it! We waited about 30 minutes before we got sat, but it wasn't too bad considering how many people were going in and out. The food comes in SUPER LARGE portions, so sharing could definitely be an option if you don't eat too much. I ordered the summer special steak hash which had corn, green beans, cheese, tomatoes and crispy potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes with eggs and chicken sausage. The pancake was the biggest I've ever seen. Both dishes were very good. They have plenty of drinks non alcoholic and alcoholic to choose from. I would like to try lunch/dinner here. You will have leftovers- TIP: Trying giving anything untouched to a bum- We had enough to feed one for two meals :)"
4488,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So good. So good. Wholesome, delicious food. Waitstaff was so friendly and attentive. During my trip I went for breakfast and dinner. Highly recommend chicken and waffles!"
4489,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was great! The time I waited for it was fair considering that Vegas is very high traffic. The plating was over-the-top, with some unneeded elements, but the flavor was definitely there. The portions of the food definitely match up with the pricing. Can be two meals for sure."
4490,Hash House A Go Go,4,If you don't mind getting a heart attack eat here! food is pretty amazing but the portions are HUGE! they place was pretty big and very busy so plan ahead for a bit of wait.
4491,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome breakfast spot on the strip. My wife and I enjoyed the meal. Huge portions and good service. The place is very popular, so its packed.  Be prepared for a but of a wait. However, it's worth the wait. Enjoy!"
4492,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Heather (ending in 16) might actually be the best waitress I've ever seen. Impeccable attention to detail with multiple tables, friendly and knowledgeable. Clearly working very hard. Made our first food experience in Vegas excellent."
4493,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They have massive plates for a fair price, and the food is really good! We got a burger, chicken and waffles, hash, and fried green tomatoes. The only thing we weren't head over heels in love with was the hash! 
Big fan of the burger, though. And the fried green tomatoes. They were incredible!"
4494,Hash House A Go Go,2,I just can't get with it. I've been here multiple times over the years when I have visitors who want to try it and every time I wonder why I keep agreeing to go back. I think the food is mediocre at best from the various things I've tried and their serving sizes are ridiculously large. Even though to go boxes are an option every time I've been all I can think of is the amount of food that goes to waste in that place. I always want to ask if they have a system for left over food to shelters or anything but always forget. Not to mention the drinks are over priced as well.
4495,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The BLT Bloody Mary is a must have.  The food is great.  You get a lot for your money, and worth the wait."
4496,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you like has house then this is a great alternative to their original location.  No wait, large restaurant with relative easy access via the M resort and hosts the same menu as  the original location.  Food is outstanding so please check it out!"
4497,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Very long wait and the taste of the food is not worth it. Large plate of flavorless food. The place is Loud inside ant out. After a 3.5 hour wait I was ready to eat anything that was placed in front of me, but it was a struggle. My wife's food was served in a cold skillet.
Our server was doing his best to smooth things out, but he was at the mercy of the kitchen staff. In Las Vegas you many other choices, make one.
Hyped up like a prize fight."
4498,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I ordered the Chicken and waffles. Chicken was ok but the waffles with the bacon cooked inside was amazing. Portions are huge so you can share, but if you're up for the Man vs Food challenge then you can each get a plate. Price is very reasonable considering you're in Vegas and on the strip. Enjoy!!!"
4499,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent food as usual. Have been here many times. This time we had a Blueberry Pancake, crisp potatoes, crispy bacon and we all shared a biscuit.  I'm so full now. Now back to the casino...."
4500,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This is my second time coming here. The first was when the restaurant was located at the M hotel (I believe). Ever since they closed that location I was going crazy trying to figure out where the restaurant went. I just remembered that it was the best fried chicken and waffle place I've ever had! So I went to Linq to finally get my fix and it was not at all what I remembered! The chicken was dry and too much batter.  The waffle was also dry. Doughy and heavy and not moist as I remembered. I think opening up a larger location just messed up the quality. Or maybe I just got a different chef.  The biscuits was good though. 

I'm just so sad bc I had this idea of hash house and now it's all just a dream."
4501,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I now dream about the chicken and waffles from Hash House A Go Go! It should be a sin to serve food this good. They took chicken and waffles to a level I never knew existed! I didn't even come close to finishing my food, so sharing might be a good idea but I wish I could have had every bite! The chicken was juicy and flavorful my only complaint was the waffles were not as crispy as I would have liked but that is me being picky. I had a Bloody Mary and it was bomb! I left happy and enlightened about how amazing chicken and waffles could be! Way to go Hash A Go Go kudos!! Happy girl!!"
4502,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We had a long wait and I was pretty hangry, but it was so worth it. The food was DELICIOUS. The service was ON POINT. And I really felt like my request for my food to be made absolutely dairy-free was taken seriously. I got the hash with veggies. SO GOOD. The biscuit was great, too. Honestly it was everything a gal could want in a brunch place. No complaints!"
4503,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is ginormous. Each plate is twice the portion you would normally get at other restaurants. I couldn't ask for a better brunch. I had pancakes, basic breakfast, and chicken & waffles. The chicken & waffles were the best visually and taste wise. The wait time is quite long because there are so many people there but it was definitely worth the wait!"
4504,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I had such high hopes for this restaurant, menu looked great with lots of variety. I ordered steak and eggs, I substituted crispy potatoes for the mashed potatoes. The service was very slow for 5:30am and the restaurant was quite empty. My order arrived the potatoes were undercooked and not crispy, the steak lacked and seasoning. When my plate was delivered I asked for Tabasco sauce and the server said he would get it. I had to ask a second time after 2/3 of my breakfast was eaten. Poor was below average and so was the service"
4505,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So let's start with the service:
Everyone was nice all the way down to the server and this means A lot being that they were super busy and our wait time was 35-40 mins. The host were organized and polite despite the maxed out wait area.

Ambience: 
it's very casual but they have their own taste. I like the slight rustic feel with the metal sheet tables and wood bottoms.. There was quite a mixture of things going on but honestly I cannot emphasize so much only because after waiting so long I was ready to start reading the menu.

Food:
I am absolutely impressed. 

I ordered the home corned beef with eggs, fried potatoes, which also came with fruit and a huge homemade biscuit (which was bigger than a cosco muffin) they also gave me homemade strawberry jam which was delish. 

When I got the food it was a huge portion two people could eat it or you could share with you little ones. The corned beef was cooked as a brisket and shredded on top of the potatoes topped with peppers and onion. It was flavorful and delicious I can't find any more words.

I did try my friends plate with their homemade mash potatoes which was tasty as well better than mine for sure!!!! And I make some awesome homemade potatoes.


order a side salad with their homemade cucumber ranch dressing it's a different feel it's like eating a salad with cucumbers except there aren't any lol!!

THIS PLACE IS A MUST STOP AND EAT KINDA PLACE... PORTIONS ARE HUGE AND THE PRICING IS VERY DECENT! Steak and eggs, corners beef with eggs, two side salads, and two sodas = $50 just saying! Average plate $12-14"
4506,Hash House A Go Go,1,The food was good but the service was horrible. Our server hardly checked in on us. She also forgot lemons with our water so when we asked for lemons she brought it on a napkin. Not sure how sanitary this is.
4507,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So...the wait sucked at this place, but NOTHING else did...this was awesome!  Anyone who has read other reviews I've posted knows I like one meal above all others, breakfast.  Though my trips to Indiana have led me to believe that there is little redeeming of that state that borders mine to the southeast, but the Hash House A Go-Go may be it's greatest export.  

We had large group, so I'm sure that didn't help the wait, but the 2.5 hour breakfast we had was absolutely belly bustingly amazing!  Our waitress was pretty aware of our wait and did a nice job to make sure our group of 6 was well cared for and not waiting long for things like coffee and other refills.  She was also helpful in ordering.  If it's your first time there, I recommend ordering (or talking someone else at your table into ordering) the Chicken Farm Benedict.  This colossal tower of food was a sight to behold.  I went for the Tractor Driver Combo.  

The TDC was two eggs (over medium), bacon, wheat toast and my choice of pancakes, french toast or waffles.  This would normally be an easy choice (pancakes), but this place isn't your ordinary breakfast joint.  Far from the ordinary, the pancakes, french toast and waffles here are the size of a large platter.  And, with flapjacks like Blueberry Pecan, Brown Sugar Banana, Blackberry Granola, Snickers, Butterscotch Almond, Apple Cinnamon, Mango Coconut, Strawberry Frosted and granola waffles or banana cinnamon french toast...forget-a-bout-it...this is the real deal.  

My choice was made slightly easier when I saw Brown Sugar banana pancakes.  I think that banana pancakes rank up there with precious jewels, gold bullion and other fine items that ought be cherished.  This was a banana pancake on steroids!  It was incredible.  It was soft on the inside, crispy and caramelized on the outside and delicious everywhere.  If I could have finished the one that I ordered, I would've contemplated ordering a second.  It was worth the gut busting pain that was likely to follow.  

Seriously, if you're in Vegas, and you have the time to wait for a seat, get to this place for breakfast.  Book some time before, and after, as you'll need to wait to get in and head back to your hotel for a food coma afterward.  This was a great meal and the perfect start to a 24 hour day in Las Vegas."
4508,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing food and great service. Went there three times for breakfast during our stay and will be back.
4509,Hash House A Go Go,4,Wow! Great service and amazing food . I had to take a picture of the chicken fried egg Benedict. Glad I was sharing and still couldn't finish. Great service too!
4510,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is pretty good! Portions are huge. I ordered a pancake and it was gigantic! Eggs were good. Pineapple Mimosa was pretty good.
4511,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were there on the week of Dec. 19-22, 2012
I'm giving it 4 stars only because we just tried it for breakfast. But it was awesome. The best pancake ever. We knew before hand that the portions were huge so my husband bought one of the basic breakfast with the hotcake and I just bought the basic breakfast (2 eggs, crispy potatoes YUM! and biscuit) and we share the hotcake which was humongous, bigger than my head, seriously. 
I didn't love the biscuit it was a bit too dry for me. But I didn't care because the hotcake made up for it. We both ate from it and still couldn't finish it. Delicious!"
4512,Hash House A Go Go,3,"FAT KIDS CLUB

Be prepared for the LOoOoooOong WAIT here.  Good part is you can put your name down on a list and go gamble.  For 2 people the wait was an hour and 15 minutes.  Another way to beat the system is to order your meal to-go it took 30 minutes.

Trust me when I say you can share a dish.  For the girls trying to hit up the clubs later on at night I suggest you DON'T try to finish a dish and just share.  Unless you don't mind feeling like a torta exploding out of your mini dress LOL.

The food here is ehhh...

Chicken and Waffles:  chicken was dry and the skin wasn't as crispy as I like.  The waffles were huge but sort of soft and mushy.  Every bite required a big gulp of milk to wash it down - that dry.

OG Benedict:  bacon, spinach, eggs over easy and biscuit with a tomato cream dressing which was delicious!  Comes with mashed potatoes which makes everything better (and unhealthier but who cares you're in Vegas!).

If I come back I'll be coming back when it's off-time for breakfast/lunch/dinner the peak time is just too crazy.

BTW this is one of the LOUDEST restaurant I've eaten at."
4513,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food is great, wait time is not. I'm thankful the servers inform people of the serving size. The place is great to try out but unless you always have a huge appetite it's more of a place I say where ohhh ok I can say I ate there it was good. Don't think I will return it may be for some but not for me"
4514,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portions are huge and the service is good. Our first visit was a long wait but the food was really good. Came here just before leaving for home and I was given cold food and burnt coffee. Seemed like the food was not cooked for today yet, we did come in at 6 am. All in all the portion size and price are good I will come back."
4515,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Delicious breakfast, original menu, fun ambiance. The  downside  was our long wait for a table (we were forewarned, therefore understandable), but  then on top of that the 60 minute wait from sit down to receiving food. The latter was totally unacceptable, especially at breakfast."
4516,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One of my most anticipated stops in Vegas. Huge portions & the food is delicious. I always get Andy's safe fried chicken Benedict. My boyfriend usually tries there burgers. & we always share a side the Mac & cheese. It is so good!! If you go on a Sunday morning be prepared to wait a little while, but it's gonna b worth every minute."
4517,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here for a late night dinner early breakfast with my brother after a night out at Omnias. We were quickly seated and ordered our food. I had the corned beef hash which was pretty delish. Portion was perfect. My brother had the tractor combo. Everything was good with the dish until we found a hair embedded within the pancake. 

It may have been an honest mistake but that's one of my pet peeves besides customer service. If the restaurant doesn't make sure the food is safe and delicious then I am not getting the utmost quality.

I will be honest, I have been to the Orlando location several times and the service, food and atmosphere have always been exceptional! The ambiance and the food quality in the Vegas location was maybe at par. The nice thing is they are open late. Also, they took the item of the menu and that was greatly appreciated."
4518,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is real, red-white-and-blue American gluttony at its finest. Portions are enough to feed a small family, and at decent prices. We were staying at IP, looking for something convenient, and were glad we came here! Interesting, creative, quality comfort food at great prices. 

It was a 20-minute wait, but the food looked so interesting that we waited. 20 minutes was perfect to go downstairs, get some Fat Tuesday and some shots, and come back. Hey, it's vacation!

As we admired other people's sage fried chicken and waffles (which looked like a gargantuan tower), the waitress took our drink orders. Despite having yard drinks in front of us, we decided to try the BLT Mary out of the sheer oddity of it. It was a spicy bloody mary served with a tomato round, lettuce, and bacon slice inside, a bacon salt rim, and a piece of toast. Not the most flavorful bloody mary I've had, but still good and very original. 

I went with the Smoked Salmon Hash (house-smoked salmon, scallions, scrambled eggs, potatoes, cream cheese, fruit and a huge biscuit on the side) while my date went with the quesadilla (chicken, jalapenos, potatoes, some other things, topped with chili cream and served over mashed potatoes). Both plates were shockingly huge, and we each got through about 1/3 of them. 

I really enjoyed my dish and the combination of ingredients, and the salmon portion was very generous. My date, who usually makes fun of me for being white and not being able to handle spicy things, had to take some of the chopped jalapeno out because there was so much of it. It was a terrific omelet though, very unique, and the chili cream is what made the dish amazing. 

Service was fast and attentive. We'll be back!"
4519,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So, if you are not into a massive buffet but still want a decent value and good hash, Hash House A Go Go may be your ticket. Beware, however, it may be ridiculously crowded. Lots of six and eight top groups. But, if you are a couple, that 45-60 minute wait may only be 25 minutes. 

Now for the food. I judge you by your hash. If it's on the menu, it had better be good. It lived up to the expectations. We also asked for a side of gravy (not free, however). It was full of sausage, and not just a rue of milk and flour. 

The prices (for the Vegas Strip) were reasonable and the food good. The wait was insane, but 10am on a Saturday is to be expected. Overall, a decent experience."
4520,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is what happens when the big city tries to recreate a small town diner. The furnishings are comfortably casual, the servers are excellent and the food is pretty damn amazing.

I started off with their signature espresso butterscotch drink and I'm honestly floored by how good it is. If you like coffee even a little bit, do yourself a favor and get this one.

Portions are terrifyingly huge, though, so definitely consider splitting a plate with someone unless you brought a serious appetite along."
4521,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Inattentive service, overpriced food, way too big of portions. 

I ordered the 2 eggs with potatoes and 1 signature pancake... the pancake was the size of a large pizza and was about as dense as one too. I was utterly embarrassed with how much food was put in front of me and my boyfriend. My ""crispy"" potatoes were browned but soggy and sad. 

We paid almost $60 for 2 eggs, some potatoes, 1 pancake, a Cobb Salad, a soda, and 1 beer. 

I do not get they hype, if you want to check it out, go when there aren't 100 people waiting in line."
4522,Hash House A Go Go,3,"3.5 stars. For the food and service. We got there're around 10:45am. Holy smokes it's packed. The lady said it'll be a 45 min wait, we took a number and decided to wait on the bar chairs. Luckily in 15 minutes someone got up from the bar table.  The waitress at the bar with purple hair was very nice. Made sure we got our menu, drinks, table was cleaned. 

She recommended the crab cake Benedict and knowing the portions here are huge we got that to share with the 2 or us.  No joke, no one can ever finish haha. Everyone around us had left overs. Even though we shared we still had leftovers. The flavour was okay, the eggs weren't traditional style benny it was fully cooked. But having to serve so many ppl I guess I'm the quality won't be as good. The bottom layer was alllll mashed potatoes, a little too heavy.

Good to try but taste is lacking."
4523,Hash House A Go Go,3,The wait wasn't too bad at 3am. The food taste good but gets overwhelming after 5 bites with a party of 3. Probably come back to try other dishes too.
4524,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing. Huge portions and very tasty. I got the corned beef hash. Had to take home half. Service was excellent. It was nice to be treated well. I didn't feel like a tourist they were trying to rush out the door. It felt more like a mom and pop restaurant. Highly recommend will come back next time I am in town.
4525,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place lives up to the hype!!! It is worth the wait (which can be over an hour during peak hours). I've tried the fried chicken & waffles, fried chicken Benedict, and the cobb salad. I thought I would really like the chicken and waffles but I ended up liking the Benedict wayyyy more. It's so hearty and delicious. Definitely share it with a friend unless you want food coma. Instead of getting ranch with the Cobb salad we substituted it for the cucumber ranch which was AMAZING. It was so refreshing. I come here almost every time I'm in Vegas now. Soo yummy!"
4526,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is a Vegas must!!! Every Time people come and visit me here this is always on the list. Andy's Sage Chicken Waffle or Benedict are hilariously awesome. Definitely, split this meal. Staff and environment are ok, ambiance is ok. The Food is INSANE. Must go!!!"
4527,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Before I get to how good the food was, the service here is super friendly! 

Now onto the food, I got the pub crawl sandwich and I didnt expect it to be that big of a portion! So its totally worth the price.  I got the mashed potatoes with cheese and bacon on it as the side order and it was probably the best I've ever had! Oh gawd!"
4528,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The drinks look good but weak not strong at all if you want signature glass pay $3 extra,the crab cake sandwich was horrible think it was cooked with cornmeal and crab meat mushy in the inside and the fried shrimp made in cornmeal too tasty disgusting the only part of food was good was the fries and the watermelon was sweet and juicy."
4529,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Wait was listed to be an hour and we waited just shy of that.  This restaurant had been recommend to us, so we were dying to try it!  Sad to report that it was not worth the wait...

We ordered a mimosa to start and it was smelly and tasted funky, but our waitress was hard to find and therefore we could not send it back.  

As a group of three, we ordered three different things so we could sample a good variety.  We had the chicken and waffles, chicken pot pie, and a Mexican style egg scramble.  The presentation is amazing (We took pictures) and the portions are HUGE.  

Chicken and waffles- Waffles were good, chicken was crispy and juicy, but flavorless and rather disappointing.

Mexican Egg Scramble-  Decent eggs.  We put them in the provided tortilla and ate them like a burrito.  Potatoes had no flavor and we left most on the plate.

Chicken Pot Pie- Very nice presentation.  Do yourself a favor and just skip this dish.  Crust was as hard as a rock, veggies were hard to manage, and flavor was just OK.

Service-  Our waitress didn't really do a great job.  Service was slow, she forgot things we asked for like lemons and coffee refills, and the table was not bussed quickly AT ALL.

Ambience- The decor was not great, lighting was kind of weird (dark and bright at the same time), and many tables were left dirty for a long time despite the over-an-hour wait outside.

I KNOW there are better places than this in Vegas.  Skip the hype and find one!"
4530,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We were staying in the Linq so it only made sense to have breakfast at such a highly rated restaurant.

Big mistake

The wagon wheel pancakes should have been a dead give away. Everything was flavorless, including the Bloody Marys. The portions were huge except for our scramble which was actually not bad and no where near big enough. Why not try making human sized portions that taste good than making ginormous, tasteless food? Hello Vegas... Oh and the picture is the size of an extra plate we asked for, the coffee cup is for scale. It nearly took up the entire table ;)"
4531,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My first impression was, ""Featured on Man vs Food...you can see why when you see the huge portions!""

Breakfast of champions. If you can go to Hash House A Go Go and finish a plate by yourself, consider yourself a champion. The portions are ridiculous! Their menu entrees list the typical American breakfast foods with a little twist. Their featured item on the menu is the chicken and waffles. I had the fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash and it was plenty to share with the boyfriend. The ingredients were very fresh, and it came with a side of a biscuit, an egg, and fruit. It was good, but I still feel like I should have tried their waffle or french toast items because those looked delicious. We opted for the ""healthier"" choice that day because we weren't feeling well, so I'll definitely have to go back and try their token menu items. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't horrible, and our waiter did a good job trying to mediate the traffic.

If you want breakfast right away, this isn't the place to go. But if you're down for the wait and willing to try this famous breakfast house then I say go for it.

The lasting impression? ""Going back for some waffles!"""
4532,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This is one place I really feel didn't deserve all of the hype it gets.  It could've been my incredible hangover souring the experience, but everything that you hear and see about it vs what you experience in person are a night and day difference. 


The hostess was a meat head.  I walked up with my buddy, she rolled her eyes at me and said ""just so you know, the wait is like 40 minutes"". No greeting, no nothing.  I pointed to two empty seats at the bar and said ""can we sit there?"" And got a sure, go ahead. 

The bartender on the other hand was very friendly and welcoming. I am a bit of a chicken and waffles addict, so I ordered that along with a Diet Coke and a water.  My friend ordered a chicken caesar salad as he hadn't seen a vegetable in at least 72 hours.  

While waiting for our food, we were reminded how stupid the average person is.  Our first neighbours were an older likely married couple.  The wife started chatting my buddy up and having a laughing good time with him. So her husband got jealous of my friends 3 digit IQ and t shirt with sleeves on it, and said ""wah yew eatin a sal-ud?You some sort a lady boy?""  To which my friend, also hung over and in a bad mood, asked him to step outside and find out. They left in a huff. 

Back to the chicken and waffles. Generally the best dish ever.  so when you order it at a famous restaurant, you're basically expecting the food equivalent of the uncensored blurred lines video.  What I got was more along the lines of meatloaf's ""I will do anything for love"".  

The dish was bountiful but half of it was what you find at the bottom of the box that holds your grandmas 20 year old fake Christmas tree.  I didn't ask for my food to be covered in pine needle branches and lawn trimmings, but it was.  My appetite was completely ruined and I ate all of seven bites.  I've seen the movie ""waiting"" and know what happens when you send food back (and can do a mean batwing) so I cut my losses and left. 

My buddy's review of his salad: ""meh"" 

Check the photo for the strangeness of the chicken and waffles. Made no sense to me.  They're so much better up here in the Canadian white north 

Bartender still got a 30% tip because I was up $1500 in an hour on the tables. So she's cool with me!"
4533,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've been wanting to try HHAGG for the longest time & on my last Vegas trip I finally gave in! And I'm glad I went to try it. Though it's given that any place you go at the strip is crowded specially if it's a popular restaurant, so expect that there will be a wait time when you go. If you don't want to wait for 30mins-hour try to go to the HHAGG off the strip. But I'm telling you, wait or no wait it's worth it!!!

First off, the portions are HUGE!!! One plate can definitely be split into two or three if you have small appetite. You'll definitely leave with a full stomach after you're done. Their food is very flavorful. The most popular food on the menu are their Sage Chicken & Waffle and the Sage chicken eggs Benedict which was featured at the show Man vs. Food. Both were amazing! But since I'm not into spicy food & the sage chicken Benedict is more on the spicy side I like The sage chicken & waffles more. It was bomb!!!! Their waffles have bacon inside & the chicken was really good. It has a different sweet but savory flavor to it. You have to try it!!!"
4534,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Nice neighborhood spot. Corned beef hash, eggs and a delicious medley of potatoes, green peppers and onions cooked perfectly. My husband had the standard bacon and eggs and said the The bacon and some of the best he ever had. He also enjoyed his cinnamon roll. I had a side of biscuits and gravy that was simply OK. Wasn't a fan of grilling the biscuits in the gravy was relatively lackluster. Otherwise, fantastic breakfast. Will be going back again soon."
4535,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This restaurant is quite small in space, but in high demand as a place with good food at reasonable prices. That means that the wait is not reasonable. Even on a Monday morning at 10:00 there was still a 20 minute wait. If you can get to the one at the RIO you would be better off in that respect. 

Otherwise the food was fine - and HUGE! Like Jimmy Fallon version of Donald Trump huge! Good luck finishing it. 

Service was fine, no problems with that. 

We walked across from the Bellagio so I cannot comment on the parking situation."
4536,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Very overrated!!!! Big portions, but lacks quality and flavor. Ordered a burger and a ribeye- both disappointed. Nowadays people go crazy for big portions and presentation. I guess it works for them- I'm more of a quality and flavor kind of guy."
4537,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always a great meal at Hash House. Love everything I have tried on the menu from the salads to the salmon and of course the chicken and waffles. Service is nice and the portions as well as quality justify the price which is about $15-20 per entree. Food comes out quickly and is beautifully presented, a staple every time we come to Vegas!"
4538,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is a great place for breakfast and it is the best dining experience that I have experienced in a while. The lines are always long and the food takes a little longer than would want but for the experience of the restaurant and the mouthwatering taste of their fantastic food it is worth the wait.
4539,Hash House A Go Go,5,words can't express the taste buds in my mouth. .everything so fresh and hot..this place is amazing the staff is amazing and honest. the drink or incredible. .i love the side glass...can't wait till we return
4540,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I went during Labor Day Weekend (Saturday) for dinner. My family went around 6:00 and there was hardly anyone so we got seated right away. This was our first time eating here and the waitresses were really nice and answered any questions about the menu. I wasn't too hungry so I shared a Hash with my sister. We got the roasted chicken with garlic, onions, and asparagus. It was really good. It also came with cornbread and eggs. We asked for honey and they had a warm honey butter which tasted really good with the cornbread. The portion was pretty big. It started to get crowded around 7:30. I saw a lot of people get the chicken and waffles which I want to try next time I go."
4541,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is a great place for breakfast.  A group of 5 of us (3 guys 2 girls) went and split 3 different meals: 

1. Blueberry Pecan Flapjack - Giant pancake packed with giant blueberries, very good. 

2. Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - Our favorite.  The mashed potatoes and spicy mashed potatoes were the winner here. 

3. Sage Fried Chicken Indiana Favorite - Very good but if you want to try the fried chicken go with the Benedict.

Definitely enough food and worth the visit for sure!"
4542,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Everything here is XXL sized! I came with my friend and we each ordered our own entree and they came in large proportions. One plate can be shared among 2 people. I ordered the sage fried chicken with mashed potatoes and bacon. I mostly liked the bacon and mashed potato, because I thought the chicken meat wasn't too fresh. The chicken was nicely fried on the outside but inside it was mushy. I didn't like the buscuit either because it was dry and didn't have much flavor. People around us ordered pancakes and they were the size of STOP signs. The customer service was good, nothing too jazzy or bad. I'll come back here again one day."
4543,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The portions are colossal.  The first few bites taste good.  The price is right. The alcohol is just as innovative as the food.  But really the food was all hype. I was a little disappointed. But if you like that twist of farm food with a southern town twist, and more bang for your buck, this is definitely the place to be.  The service was outstanding too."
4544,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've been to the San Diego location several of times and was excited to find out there were multiple LV locations. Because of all the construction at The Quad, it was a little hard to find. I was just glad there was no wait for a table - I thought it was more popular. The service was a bit slow during dinner even though they weren't busy at all. The portions are huge and you can probably share most of the dishes. I guess the price is okay because of the size but this is one time when quantity doesn't beat quality. Thankfully I had a Restaurant.com coupon (yay iPhone app) and saved $25 on the meal. Otherwise I would've been pretty bummed at the overall experience. I don't think I'll be back (to this location). There are so many other places I'd rather eat at on the Strip."
4545,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here around 3am for a ""snack"" and dlgot the chicken and waffles. It was....more than a snack! Amazing flavor,it was a fancier version of the original and big enough for at least 2 to share. And our waiter was so good to us too!  I will be coming back on my next Vegas trip!"
4546,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Very good, very fun place.  Ordered the chicken and waffles (of course) and was very impressed with the food and the presentation.  Waffles with bacon were excellent, and the bloody mary was a treat as well.  

As a bonus, our server was very helpful - a couple of friends had to catch a flight, so the server rushed our orders as much as he could.  

Highly recommended for breakfast."
4547,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The portions are hefty (man vs food), but also come with a flavor of fireworks. The brown sugar and banana flapjack, wowwww! The servers were pretty attentive, which is great because this place was packed, and for good reason. If you have a bite card, you get a discount here. Definitely will be back next time I'm in town."
4548,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Giant Portions - Very good for the price

Good Service - the food takes some time though."
4549,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome way to start day 2 in Vegas. Reasonably priced for this city. Highest quality. Well seasoned. Takes a little while to get your food but it's well worth it. Highly recommended. HUUUUUGE portions will cure what ails you and get you through most of the day. It was fun just gawking at others orders.
4550,Hash House A Go Go,1,What is the big hype? Went for breakfast and it was dry and so was the service.
4551,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Bad location the garnish ruins the meal there's  no restrooms inside the restaurant 


Great music and fun environment  AMAZING BLOODY MARY'S BUT THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE SUCks bC OF THE LOCATION I would not go back"
4552,Hash House A Go Go,5,"There was no way that we could leave Vegas without checking this place out. After hearing so much about it, I had very high expectations about this place and I'm happy to say they were met! We went around 2 am and the place was packed which to me, was a good sign. After taking a while to look over the menu, we finally made up our minds as to what we wanted to order.

My boyfriend ordered a burger (as he typically does in EVERY SINGLE restaurant ::insert eye roll::)  while I opted for the sage fried chicken eggs benedict. We both had ordered their spiked kiwi watermelon lemonade.

The portions are RIDICULOUS for the price. We could have easily split the burger and been full off of that, but seriously where's the fun in that? When in Sin City, gluttony is a must! 

The drinks were sooooo good. I'd say maybe, too good. You could barely taste the alcohol so theyre definitely the kind of drinks that sneak up on you. 

The sage fried chicken eggs benedict is literally one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. The chicken was perfectly fried and full of flavor. The biscuit was nice and fluffy. The griddled mashed potatoes were out of hand! The chipotle cream gave me life. It gave the plate a nice kick without overpowering it. I had enough  leftovers for both of us to eat for breakfast AND lunch the next day. This will be our first stop when we are in Vegas again."
4553,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Took a cab form the Cosmo over to The Quad. First things first - The Quad has been renovated, but still has a long way to go. That said, Hash House is fantastic. We arrived around 10am and the place was packed. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes to eat.

In the end, it was well worth the wait. I opted for the veggie hash. It included sun dried tomatoes, potatoes, artichoke hearts and mushrooms. It was huge. Far more than I could eat. I did not order them, but tons of people got pancakes. They looked out of sights.

N*joy..."
4554,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place is all about quantity, not quality.  If you're starving, come here.  If you want good food, go elsewhere.

I had biscuits and gravy.  I used to live in the South, so I know what this dish (which, honestly, is just a heart attack on a plate) is all about.  The restaurant got the heart attack part right, but totally missed out on the part that makes the heart attack worth it.  The sausage gravy was chalky and flavorless.  The biscuits were cold.  Perplexingly, the biscuits and gravy were served on a massive bed of mashed potatoes.  Now, I love mashed potatoes, but it just didn't fit in here.  I ate less than a quarter of it.  No one else at my table finished their meals either, and we all agreed that it was pretty mediocre.  

Service was much better than I ever would've guessed, which is the only reason that they get two stars."
4555,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It's true.  The portions are HUGE.  

The wait was about 20 minutes and it was packed.  However, we were seated quickly and the food was excellent and reasonably priced for its location along with great service (thank you Mark D.).  Be warned that two can share an entrÃ©e with food left over!"
4556,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions were very gracious and the food was great. Our waitress was Lusia, she was very attentive, friendly and made great suggestions while answering all of our questions."
4557,Hash House A Go Go,4,The chicken and waffles here are fantastic. I enjoyed the large portion sizes which made a perfect midnight snack =]
4558,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I LOVE this place! Every morning in Vegas I wake up tweeting to get there! Lol. The food is great , large portions at reasonable prices. The only downfall is the wait...... Any given day is a 30-60 minute wait. But, it's worth it........ I have tried a lot of things, and it all was good. Don't miss out on it. The location is kind of hidden. You can take the monorail to Harrahs's and walk over to Linq and you will be right there ."
4559,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was awesome! The food was HUGE and filling. My husband had a burger and it could of fed us both. He also had the BLT Bloody Mary and it was spicy but the bacon was crisp. I had the basic breakfast and was very happy with it all! We wanted to return but really just had to much to do. Highly recommend!
4560,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was great! Thought food was tasty & freakin huge portions. Most dishes can be split among two people & still be super full. Recommend the chicken Benedict meal. Had biscuits potatoes eggs spinach Bacon fried chicken with great sauce gravy covered and it all seemed to go excellent together. New regular spot for us whenever we come to LV. Gotta try.
4561,Hash House A Go Go,3,"What I learned from eating at Hash House:

--Breakfast indeed is the most important meal of the day.. especially when you're getting ready for a long, activity-filled day
--The whole ""Man v. Food"" thing hypes this place up a LOT
--I should take recommendations from another TV personality whose tastes are more suited to mine; ie. Giada
--I should check out photos of dishes before blindly ordering
--The food here is not as ""traditional"". There is a twist on everything, hence the tagline

Overall, nothing wrong with this place, but I'm not in a hurry to go back."
4562,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, the flavors were good but it was way too much food for myself. You can share this plate with several people. The dining staff was great and efficient; great team players!! Go team!!!"
4563,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was absolutely fantastic, probably the best I've had since I got to Las Vegas.  With that being said, I had the worst service I've had in a long time.  Not only did it take her way to long to greet us, way too long to get our drinks but when we finished our meals, she just dropped the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  Then she proceeded to bug us about paying the bill when we clearly hadn't even touch the check yet.  No joke, asked us 3xs to pay the bill & when I finally caught an attitude she said had to use the bathroom & was trying to handle our bill before doing so (don't ever tell your table that!) I also watched her at the table next to us.  The table did leave a lot of coins and I know as a server that's frustrating but you never let the table know that! Coins are still money, that's why the US still has them.  Not only was she rude to that table but she sat there and counted all the bills in front of them so make sure they left her enough, she did the same for our table.  I have never been to a place where the server had the audacity to count the money in front of the table...like I said the food was absolutely fantastic, the sage chicken benedict was out of this world, but if you plan on going to the restaurant, expect terrible service ( btw this is my first time commenting on yelp & I felt compelled to do so because of the horrific service...I also have been a server for years and know when somebody is just too busy to give good service, or they just suck...and clearly this person just SUCKED)"
4564,Hash House A Go Go,3,"3.75. Very good food!! HUGE portions. We had 6 in our party (girls week-end), and split 4 entrees, with food leftover. Wow. Chicken and waffles. Awesome presentation, with a stick of rosemary anchoring it down. Chicken was moist and crispy. Waffle was soggy and not so great :(. Veggie hash was tasty, but surprisingly on the smaller scale of other entrees.

Wait was long for brunch, but somehow, we were seated quickly. Waitress was friendly, and food came out relatively quickly. Bathroom is downstairs, around the corner :(. Very popular spot. Great food, huge servings, friendly service. Can see why this is popular in Vegas. My advice, split it."
4565,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Heard the hype, wanted to try.

Pros:
Huge portions
Great Service

Cons:
More food, less taste
Overpriced for the quality

I weigh my reviews heavily on the quality and taste of the food. The food at this place was okay at best. The portions are bigger than Claim Jumpers, but the flavors were sub par. I split the sage chicken and waffles with a friend (there is a two or three dollar charge to split the plate.)  

When we got it, it was so nicely presented and huge. I was shocked. I didn't know where to start. When I tried the waffle, it tasted plain. I really needed the syrup with it, but there was bacon baked inside of it and I did not like to mix sweet and savory. The chicken was cooked well, nice and tender, but again it was plain. There was no real spices to it. I had to dunk it in my friend's sauce to finish off one piece. After a while, the flavors mixed together and everything became sickening to eat and look at. 

My friend ordered sage chicken with the eggs benedict. His plate was huge as well. He had chicken, eggs benedict, a biscuit, and mash potatoes all covered with hollandaise sauce. Literally everything was covered in a blanket of sauce. After a while, he too gave up. He is a pretty big guy and if he gave up, I'm sure the food was too much and too overwhelming after a while. 

My favorite part of the meal was the watermelon-kiwi lemonade. You have to order it. Comes with a piece of watermelon on the side. Very yummy. I tasted more watermelon than lemonade, but that's okay since I don't really find watermelon drinks anywhere. 

Don't believe the hype. The food will overpower your taste buds, and not in a good way."
4566,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Gave HH A GOGO another try and think I liked it more than the first time.

Went around 10:30 p.m. The restaurant was relatively empty. We were immediately seated. Our waitress was delightful. She even brought us both our own biscuits enshrined in honey butter--they were complimentary!!

I ordered the HH Twisted burger #2 with fries. The burger was just okay, but needed some seasoning and the spicy/cheesy profile was not great. The fries were good.

My man ordered the chorizo hash with eggs and fruit garnish. He was not a fan, as their potatoes are not very good or flavorful--the focus is more on herbs than salt. 

Overall, I think I would come back and try other popular items. As it stands, not the best food in Vegas or the Strip, but a cheap eatery with massive portions."
4567,Hash House A Go Go,3,"When you get in you kind of feel like you're a cattle herded up a rickety old escalator and into a small rectangular room with no windows. 

However you're greeted with some jolly hosts in Pajamas and super hero gear, in what seems to be some kids dream/ nightmare. While you wait youare offered a mimosas and bloody marys. The bloody mary , costing 10 bucks is HUGE.

When you sit down you'll notice the shoddy halogen lighting and lack of decor, but that all doesn't matter when you get your mountain of food.

I would recommed just split one thing for two, or if you want to feel like a fat king or queen or prince or dutchess, just order one of these monster plates for yourself.

For vegas its more for taking photos, but at the same time you can pay a little more for a buffet. 

Food is solid and tasty. 

But its nothing you can't find in a smaller portion at KFC or Dennys."
4568,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When I'm craving breakfast at anytime of the day I instantly think of the typical IHOP, Denny's, or some nearby casino cafe. Well now that I've officially dined at Hash Hash A Go Go I'll instantly think of here. It's breakfast 24/7 with huge plates.It also happens to be on the Vegas Strip. The portions are no joke humongous come here to stuff your face bringing someone to help eat is recommended. I believe they were also featured on some travel channel or food network show which is always cool.

Sage chicken benedict http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=cGsK1B1Z519hdfb6YeX3HA it's a must here so delicious.

The corned beef hash http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=_OC3pVhtKBDqgIhJeCqMPA was pretty good too. It came with eggs and a huge biscuit.

And dont forget the softball sized biscuits drenched in gravy or not but why wouldn't you drench them in.gravy it only makes sense to.

How about those huge French toast and pancakes. The French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=T-5Gzq0cSGBQN5dOBAVIOw was covered with nuts, whipped cream, syrup, and powdered sugar. And those pancakes seemed almost an inch thick and was almost as large as the plate it was served on. They offer different flavors, like pumpkin! 

Customer service was excellent. We were in and out with no problem. Our server, forgot his name, was such a character made the whole experience even better than what we'd expected. The price is reasonable for the amount of food.

Considering I had just eatan at a Xmas party maybe an hour ahead then unknowingly demolished a whole plate here the food has to be good. I'll definitely be back. Maybe they'll take that Groupon I bought a few years back for a location that closed at M casino."
4569,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I am so disappointed. I have heard such good things but after last night I will never come to this one again! I came here with my boyfriend and my family because there were in town staying at the hotel. First off the hostess looked and sounded stoned as well as being on her cell phone as we were leaving. Next, our server had no idea what ""on tap"" meant as well as not knowing what beers they had. The biggest issue we had was the fact that they brought each dinner out 10 min apart... There for 4 of us so by the time everyone finally had their meal the first order brought out was cold. As if that wasn't bad enough I had to grilled salmon and it was so dry I was eating off my boyfriends plate instead... I will NEVER come back to this particular Hash House again I would also encourage anyone else that is considering going here to avoid it at all costs. So not worth the money!!!!"
4570,Hash House A Go Go,5,Can you say amazing? I stayed in the quad and this was recommended by a friend of mine. I didn't have high expectations for this place but it blew my mind. Our server was great. I had the Kokomo and I've literally been dreaming about it ever since. The fries were fresh and hot and just freaking perfect. I can't wait to go back. My next vacation will be somewhere near a Hash House.
4571,Hash House A Go Go,5,"They should add like three more Go's to their name so that you really understand how much you need to go here!!! 

This is hands down the best breakfast I have ever had. Sorry Mom!!!!! Maybe if you dipped your French toast in banana cinnamon cream and covered it in pecans I would give you a better Yelp review. I never really understood I liked banana until I tasted the carmelized banana they put on top of this masterpiece of a meal. 

If that isn't incentive enough to eat here then you should see the pancakes. Even the kids pancake portion is bigger than your head. 

If you order an adult meal be prepared to leave with a standard sized adult meal in a box because the portions are huge. Even with portions this size the quality is top notch. I could seriously eat here for every meal."
4572,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Long wait and semi-slow service, but oh-m-gee, that brown sugar banana pancake totally made up for it! I don't even like pancake but it's seriously good. The butter and syrup definitely made it richer, but it was good by itself too. And did I mention it's freakin huge!"
4573,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent HH Quesadilla! Was enough to feed my significant other and myself. It was huge! Kendra's service was as good as the food, Thank You, Kendra!"
4574,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Giving HH 3 stars. I went to the location inside of the The Quad Hotel & Casino. It's 24/7 which is nice. I enjoyed a HH house Cobb salad with chicken and my boyfriend had a very appetizing 1lb stuffed burger. The French fries were very good as well as the burger. My salad was ok, I would've preferred smaller chicken chunks as opposed to what I received (extremely large chunks). It was still good nonetheless. We were a lil bummed because we couldn't get the steak until after 5pm which kinda defeats the purpose of being 24/7 establishment."
4575,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Large portions does not mean good food.
I ordered the Chorizo Hash, with eggs over medium. This was served on a cast iron skillet, but it wasn't hot, in either temperature or spiciness. Disappointed . Couldn't finish it.
The diner seated next to me ordered oatmeal with fruit. They must have served him a pound of oatmeal and a pound of fruit, but the fruit wasn't ripe and who can eat that much oatmeal! What a waste."
4576,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food is insanely good. Menu has large variety. Portions are HUGE. Drinks are on point and service is always awesome. 

If you're going to the spot in the Linq the wait can get a bit ridiculous if you're going during busy hours, I think it's totally worth it though!"
4577,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I got the sage chicken and waffle and my boyfriend got the fried chicken eggs Benedict. The chicken is cooked perfectly and tastes very sweet (which is not for my taste buds). The portions are very large! The fried chicken eggs Benedict wasn't the greatest for my boyfriend either. Both dishes were really subpar and unfortunately I came in with high expectations because of reviews. Nonetheless, the food was good but I personally wouldn't come again. Service was fast too! They charge $2 for ranch."
4578,Hash House A Go Go,4,Not long wait for a full popular place. Choose this location because it was the closest to Mandalay Bay. We went around 10am. Server was great. Food was very good. Griddle french toast was very good. Husband enjoyed the bacon waffle and the snicker bread pudding. Would return. Portions are real good.
4579,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was so excited to try this place out and hyped it up so much I didn't think it could disappoint. I saw this place featured on Man v. Food and on countless billboards around the Strip. This location, inside Imperial Palace, had a huge line and fairly long wait. I was famished and didn't mind the wait as long as the food lived up to all the hype. Before I even looked at the menu, I knew I wanted to order their signature dish...the chicken and waffles. While I waited for my order to arrive, I saw a wide arry of delicious dishes being zipped back and forth in front of our table. All looked craftly plated, with huge heaping portions. I salivated each time my beloved (or so I thought) chicken and waffles would zip in and out of my line of sight. Finally it arrived, moment of truth. I bite into my deep fried chicken breasts and was underwhelmed to say the least. Batter was soggy, not crispy with the resounding crunch I had imagined. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and moved on to the waffles, hoping that Hash House would redeem themselves here. But alas, I was disappointed yet again. The waffles were huge, and filed with bacon which made my eyes grow large with a childlike wonder, yet I lamented again when I found those waffles to be soggy and rather flat in flavor. 

Needless to say I walked away from this place pretty much disappointed. Will probably not be returning anytime soon...at least not on my own accord."
4580,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent breakfast. Big portion you can definitely share.drew our server did an awesome job. I highly recommend this place. I will remember this experience for rest of my life.
4581,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great spot for brunch! It is pretty packed in the morning but the wait isn't too bad around dinner time!
4582,Hash House A Go Go,5,There is nothing bad i can say about this place. The amount of food is incredible the quality is great and the twist on the classics are terrific. I had the man vs food sage chicken benedict. Friends had the chicken and waffle and the stuffed burger. Everyone enjoyed. If your not a big eater find someone you can share the dish with. Or you will be taking home food.
4583,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A GoGo never disappoints! Great service, delicious food. It doesn't get much better then this. Total vacation food."
4584,Hash House A Go Go,5,I had the steak and egg special and it was amazing. The mashed potatoes were perfect and the steak was cooked to order. In addition the kiwi watermelon lemonade was perfect too. Definitely coming back to hash house everytime im in vegas. Especially those late nights and alot of the places are closed.
4585,Hash House A Go Go,3,"5 stars for my first visit. 2 stars for my second visit.

We stayed at the Linq so Hash House A Go Go was a convenient breakfast spot. Besides, twisted farm food sounded interesting so we decided to give this place a shot. Ended up waiting no longer than 45 min for a party of 2 for the first trip. Second trip had no wait because it was late at night.

SERVICE: The first time around, service was awesome. Our server brought everything to us in a timely manner. However, the second time around, at 3AM, service was dead. What made me laugh was the fact that as the server was filling our glass cups and ran out of water, she nonchalantly said ""oh ran out"" and never came back to fill up my water cup. I was so thirsty from the disgusting corned beef hash and dry biscuit. 

FOOD: For breakfast, the food was awesome. I had the gravy biscuit mashed potatoes thingy (idr the name) and it was savory and delicious. My girlfriend ordered the flapjack not knowing that it was the size of Yao Ming. The second time, I had the corned beef hash which was my biggest ragret. 

Overall 3 stars for this place."
4586,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is amazing! Best breakfast I have ever had. I don't usually write reviews but this is well deserved. They cook everything to order so you have to waiting a little longer but it's totally worth the wait. I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Twice. It was that good. I recommend that you share. The portions are huge and there is more than enough for two. My husband had the meatloaf hash. It was by far the best meatloaf either one of us had ever had. I would order it and I don't ever eat meatloaf. The prices are great. Hash House A Go Go is definitely one of the cheapest places we ate at our stay in Vegas. I would go again and again and again. The service was good the food is great! I completely recommend!
4587,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My favorite ""breakfast"" place in Las Vegas.  Went to the one in the Linq this time.  Same menu as the Sahara location...
I had the chicken and waffles while the lady had the biscuits and gravy breakfast.  Both were excellent and both were enough for two people....  Next time, she gets to pick and we only order one entrÃ©e with a set up.
Service was excellent and the food was delicious.  The maple reduction is excellent.

Come about 20 to 30 minutes before you want to eat, you will be waiting for a table!  They're that good and worth the wait!"
4588,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Service was just awful and extremely disorganized.  It took them two hours to seat a part of 6 because they just never seemed to have the perfect sized table for us.  Food took close to an hour to come out of the kitchen, and everything was covered in butter, cheese, and dressing.  Clearly nobody is going here to eat healthy, but this place wasn't decadent, it was just kinda gross."
4589,Hash House A Go Go,1,"uh no no no......one of my gfs brought us to this place after she saw it on Man vs. Food.  Ok one star because this place was on a television show.  Before we started eating..I already wanted to gag because I started seeing what was being brought out...it was like regular food on steroids.  The food was just ok..I guess the novelty is the portion size..ok fun, experienced that.  Afterwards I would say 2 of the 4 of us were not having a good time....I'll leave that to the imagination.  With all the other good eats in Vegas..I would skip this....."
4590,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Every time I'm in San Diego, my friends always tell me to go here because they rant and rave about how amazing this place is. I never got a chance until this past Monday.

Located at the LINQ hotel (on the second floor from the casino), I already saw how busy this place was when I was walking towards it. I was happy to hear that they were open till 9 PM on Christmas Day even though they're a 24/7 business. I felt bad for the workers but I wanted to give this place a shot. I was with a party of 7 people and we all waited patiently for about 20-30 minutes and we were in. I'm sure the wait is usually about 40-50 minutes.

Breakfast food is served all day, so I got the hardwood bacon, avocado, onion, and swiss omelette. Pretty basic but I was content with it. I should've ordered the mashed potatoes, I got the crispy potatoes instead. They were good, but I think I was in the mood for something softer. That's entirely my fault. My plate came with a biscuit and it had a sprig of sage on it. I don't like biscuits but this was actually good lol.

I tried some of the other peoples foods and they all tasted pretty great. The Texas Ranchero was pretty good, but I think I expected it to be more similar to an eggs benedict. It was just a rendition of it, but not eggs benedict. So hard to explain...I know I don't make sense but it had sopes as the English muffin and it was toppled with cilantro, tortilla strips, black beans, chorizo, avocado, and scrambled eggs (you cannot substitute the scrambled eggs to be poached, this is their Texas Ranchero). This was resting on top of the mashed potatoes and you can't substitute that either.

The crab cake benedict was pretty flavorful. I sampled a piece of it and wished I wasn't sick so I could just go ham on their plate but I didn't want to be rude and eat all their food and spread my disease.

Oh. And the one thing I had failed to notice was that their portions are HUGE. So I would've been fine to just order one plate and share that.

Next time you're in the area come here and enjoy some decent breakfast food.

TL;DR
Show up with your whole party, they can't seat you unless you are all there.
Sharing is caring because they have huge portions. Maybe even try ordering family style? Who knows.
Be prepared to wait."
4591,Hash House A Go Go,3,"SOOOOOO much hype. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the food but it's never lived up to any of the hype. The portions are just ridiculous. I mean I can usually share one of their entrees with 2 other people. Let me rephrase, YOU HAVE TO SHARE AN ENTREE. Don't try to get your own plate unless you want to carry around left overs up and down the strip or you want it sitting in your hotel room making it smell like left over fried chicken."
4592,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Came there to eat some brunch and ordered chicken and waffles and the tractor combo. Both were pretty good, but the restaurant itself was unsanitary. We saw a cock roach on our table and got rid of it as soon as we saw it on the table. We wanted to get our meal compensated, but without any proof, that wasn't possible. So the food was good, but unless they manage to get rid any possible infestations, I will not be going back."
4593,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ordered the #5 Burger with cheddar and avocado. Aside from being visually pleasing, it was perfect in every way. Wife had the baked chicken which she thoroughly enjoyed. Flavor was mild and chicken was tender. Lemon vinaigrette dressing was amazin ng. Server was pleasant and attentive. Portions are definitely generous. A must stop when you're in Vegas."
4594,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Solid place with huge portions. Service was decent, food was solid, atmosphere was pretty good. Decent prices."
4595,Hash House A Go Go,5,We were recommended this place by some friends and it did not disappoint. The portions are ginormous so a 2 person split is perfect. My wife and I split the Tenderloin Benedict and it was delicious. Neat atmosphere was fun and the service was great.
4596,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We missed this restaurant on our last visit; but our travel agent encouraged us to make sure we didn't miss it this time. My wife & I had the fried chicken & waffles & the presentation was only surpassed by the flavor.  Our cocktails were amazing.  We had their Bloody Mary, & a Mimosa. It is place not to be missed & worth the wait"
4597,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Artery clogging, jolly good time having everything at this place.

What can I say about Hash House that i'm sure hasn't already been mentioned a mouthful of times. See what I did there? And seeing is believing when you see the portions here. Holy macaroni!

Ginormous portions. Crazy delicious food. Delicious boozy drinks. Fun atmosphere. 

While the portions were clearly more than either of us could eat, and we could have shared a single item... then why are you in vegas if not to indulge and go overboard? I felt zero guilt only eating a third of my plate and giving the rest of it to a hungry homeless person on the strip. Why not? 

If you come here on the weekends, especially during peak meal hours... expect to wait! While the wait may seem daunting, it went faster than expected. Talk to people in line with you, meet new people. It's fun. We met a couple from the UK there on vacation. Super awesome accents.... but I digress from the topic at hand. Hash House! 

Huge fan of this place. My waistline and taste buds thank you hash house. Well done.

Side note: chicken and waffles is a winner. winner, winner chicken dinner-- er breakfast! p.s. sneaky bacon slices in the waffles! Meatloaf breakfast thingymabob was also bomb. Oh, and the drinks. Yea the drinks. Do it."
4598,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was really excited to see this on the itinerary from my weekend in Vegas. I have heard great reviews about it from the food network and friends. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The food was just ok in my mind nothing speculator. 

I know they are famous of the chicken and waffles but I did not get that because it does not seem appetizing to me. I did try some and I thought the waffles were great but the chicken not so much. I got the BBBLT and a side of fries. The portions are huge and had I known that I would have probably split it with someone even though I did finish the whole sandwich.

My biggest complaint of the whole experience was that my food took forever to come out especially after everyone in my party was already served. I also felt like the waiter was overwhelmed and instead of having someone help him he just tried to do everything himself which made service pretty bad. 

For being on the strip I did not think that the price was that bad. I definitely would give this place a shot just to say you have been but I felt there breakfast and lunch menu could have been bigger and more diverse. I definitely would try it again if I was in Vegas."
4599,Hash House A Go Go,2,The portion is too big. And the food is not worth the price( except the portion). Don't know why it's 4 star.
4600,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The hype is real!!! This place is crazy. Get here before 10am or you're going to be waiting a while. The feel is like a trucker stop collided with a diner that was owned by a modern interior designer. Make sure you go hungry because the portions are huge. Very easy for 2 adults to share a plate and not go away hungry. 

We ordered a snickers flap jack, and this thing was the size of a pizza. I thought the waitress was joking when she said it was the size of a Prius tire, but she wasn't. HUGE, and more surprising, no loss of flavor or quality. Great exterior with a nice, soft interior. 

I had some bacon and eggs, and they were as good as any I've ever had. Our friends ordered the house special (I forget the name) but it had a sage fried chicken, waffle, some crazy good sauce, mashed potatoes, and fried spaghetti. I stole half their plate and went into a food coma. Of course you can't forget about the BLT Bloody Mary. I'm not a Bloody Mary fan, but that may have converted me. 

Service was awesome, food was even better. We will definitely return next time in Vegas."
4601,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Long wait but for i dont know what. Hot as hell. Poor service, rude hostess. The light skinned large sized woman was rather rude calling us to our table. She should work in the back where there is no interaction with paying patrons. Otherwise maybe im giving 2 stars for that and the dish i had- meatloaf hash. Too thymey tasting. Biscuit is big and tasty. Saw the chicken and waffle come out- now that looked insanely good. Would not come back here sorry!"
4602,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Finally got down to the IP tonight to see what all the fuss is about. Much like everybody else here, I saw HH featured on Man V Food and vowed Id check it out one day.

Despite what I read in some other reviews our server was outstanding. He was informative, helpful, and attentive. I had the ""Pacers Hash"" and my friend had the ""Sage Fried Chicken Benedict""  The portions are, indeed, rediculously huge, but I thoroughly enjoyed the food.

The prices are very affordable(like 13-25 a plate) and the location was easy to find on the 2nd level of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino.

We will be back."
4603,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was absolutely wonderful. The entire staff is nice, fun and upbeat. The food is incredible! Totally worth the price. You must try the brown sugar banana pancake, it's to die for. 
We went twice on our two day vacation. Will go again next visit."
4604,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We came here because we were tired and hungry and saw it walking from our room through the casino when we went to wander the strip. I was going to have our group go to grand lux in the Venetian which would have been a much better options. But we ended up here instead. 

Prices are about the same as at grand lux or most other sit down places on the strip at like $13ish for breakfast type items. I got the corned beef hash and was surprised when it was shredded corn beef instead of ground which I thought was nice. I got scrambled eggs with them and they were very bland so I wasn't a fan. The potatoes were decent being homestyle fries style with the corned beef and cheese on top. They give you a biscuit which sucks, hard as a rock and bland and dry, we ended up taking them and threw them at our friend while wandering the strip. Everything comes with a stalk of rosemary stuck in it which looks tacky in my opinion, but whatever they think is cool. Other than the food being pretty bland, the portions were large and served in cast iron skillets which was cool and nice. Our waiter was a d-bag and made the experience even worse. He was never around, and the only time we saw him was when we ordered and when our food came, and when he brought us the check. When he brought us our food, he asked us how everything tasted, which how do we know since we just got the food?!?!  And then we didn't see him again till he brought us the bill

I won't come back. Grand lux is far better in taste, class of the restaurant, service, and overall experience"
4605,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is amazing! Good food, huge portions. We discovered this place on day 2 in Vegas. We were able to save time and money by eating a late breakfast here and taking leftovers for lunch, and/or splitting a meal. I wish we had one in Boise. I still dream about the chicken, asparagus hash!"
4606,Hash House A Go Go,5,This please has the best breakfast I've ever had! Def worth the wait and hype! I order the chicken Benedict it was life changing! It was so big that my husband was honored with finishing it off for me!
4607,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I stay at the Linq for one reason.
Hash House a Go Go is located there.
I can party hard, roll out of bed and get brunch and a bloody mary whenever I want."
4608,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Over-rated as 'best breakfast place in Las Vegas'. We arrived around 10:30 on a Monday to find a line of about 8 to 12 people. The line moved quickly and we were seated within 15 minutes.

As per other reviews, portions are very large. After looking at the menus (and a few pics on Yelp) I ordered the sage chicken, eggs and mashed potatoes. My friend ordered the Corned Beef Hash. Overall service was good, attentive and prompt. Environment is unique with checkered chrome metal on the walls and comfortable booths. 

I didn't taste hers so all I can say is she liked it. Nice large strips of corned beef hash over potatoes with some gravy. She ordered hot tea and it came in a rather unique tea bag. 

I ordered the Andys Sage Chicken, Eggs and Mashed Potatoes along with coffee. The chicken is breaded and deep fried. Mashed potatoes have bacon in them. Eggs were over easy and there was also two strips of bacon. The eggs were a bit overcooked but still slightly runny. The chicken left a lot to be desired, tasteless and bland. The breading added nothing to the flavor and was too thick for my preference. Bacon also wasn't very tasty. The mashed potatoes were ok but there's a lot. There was a raspberry drizzle around the outside of the plate that proceeded to make everything I touched sticky. Not a big fan.

Overall I'd call it a disappointing visit from my perspective. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles but wasn't a big fan of how it was presented after looking at the pics on Yelp."
4609,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Arrived at 11:39am checked in. The process was very organized considering how slammed the waiting area was. We finally got called up at 12 and sat, about 10 mins till a server took our drink order, we put the food in as well just based on how long that took. Its 1:10pm  and its been over an hour of sitting and waiting for the food. Not really sure why its taking so long. If you're looking for regular service I do not recommend eating here, if you have plans for the rest of your day.

I ordered the crab cake Benedict, it was okay, lots of carbs. One crab cake,  one fried egg over a bed of mash potatoes and two biscuits. It needed at least another egg or two to cut the carbs. Overall not really impressed for an hour wait. the presentation was great tho."
4610,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Yummy, yummy for the tummy!!! The chicken and waffles are a must have!!! My new favorite spot in Vegas. The food is fresh and fabulous."
4611,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Let me just say that when you go here you will not be disappointed! The food selection is awesome with portions that are deadly if you consume all of it in one sitting!

Our server was excellent with answering out questions and getting our food out in a timely manner! I was pleased with everything from the food to the service. It's a must you visit here when in Vegas!"
4612,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Massive portions.  Food was good enough.  Went with my boy and he's a big eater.  Even he couldn't finish.

Prices reasonable. Vegas used to have great late night options, but they're dwindling as casinos turn to fast food mall-style eateries for after hours.   I hate it. But this place is a bit of the good old days.


Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."
4613,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Portions are huge and taste is amazing. Definitely a plus, plus. Price wasn't bad either."
4614,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I don't know what it is about this place, but this is the second time I had breakfast here and it really didn't impress me. This time I had the infamous New York Times favorite chicken and waffles. I have to admit the fried chicken breasts were tender and juicy, but there was no wow factor when it came to flavor. The waffles lacked in flavor. It really didn't even taste like waffles. It was just bleh. Even the syrup didn't help it much. If I do return to a hash-a go go in Reno or Las Vegas it will probably be for your normal breakfast type meals because I tasted my wife scrambled eggs and they were good. I like when they scramble them soft and not too hard."
4615,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love the food, great portions, decent price. Only reason this is a 4 star review, there is always a long wait."
4616,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Overrated. Yes, they have huge portions, which is great if you're looking for that. Also, it is open 24/7 and has lots of variety.

Maybe it was just what I had, the chicken hash, but I just didn't find the food quality to be great. The hash was more like breakfast potatoes and the chicken was all dark meat, which isn't my thing. 

Also we had to wait forever for our food (50 minutes from when we sat down) and when I finally got my food, it was not with the right eggs. They offered to take it back but I had waited so long I just kept it. Not worth it."
4617,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I understand that this restaurant is located inside Imperial Palace which might be one of the worst casinos in Vegas, but we're here for the food right?

I got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and I've got to say, it's a massive portion of food! This is probably the most well known item on the menu, and for good reason.

All of the food from the crispy juicy friend chicken, the waffles and the syrup was great. This could probably feed 2 people. I was pretty hungry and I had about 3 pieces of chicken to bring home. It's also not incredibly expensive either so that's a good thing after a long night of gambling.

I will probably come here again on my next time to Vegas, but I won't make the mistake of ordering it just for myself.

4618,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Going to Vegas for the first time can be quite overwhelming, what makes the trip easier is visiting with a Vegas Veteran.  In this case, my boyfriend.  I write up a list of places to eat and things to do and my bf informs me how essential it is that Hash House a Go Go is a MUST EAT.  

I'm all about good eating so I add this place to the list and eagerly research their online menu to see what's good.  Reading up on the benedicts I bee lined on the: House smoked salmon with fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili creme and 2 basted eggs.  The bf gets his regular: the Andy's sage fried chicken with spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, grilled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs.  

When we finally got to Hash House, located all the way in the back of the Imperial palace casino up the elevators, we were SOOO hungry for breakfast.  There's a long line here so if you can go early or if you're a platinum member cardholder make sure you tell the host or hostess when you put your name down.  After we realized that we could do that we were seated promptly.  We both already knew what we wanted, but I HAD to order hot chocolate.  Even better?!?  A Smore's hot chocolate!!! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=p79oe4kOMulYacX3t3UMpw

This was amazingly delicious!! Comes with a graham cracker & everything.  I had envious eyes all around me from other patrons at Hash House. In a fair amount of time our long awaited food comes and we dig in.  My bf is enjoying every bite of his fried chicken and eggs.  I liked mine too, i just thought my asparagus was a wee bit over cooked.  There was so much food I tried hard to get through all of it.  Alas mashed potatoes and fish and everything on that  platter of a plate, won in the end.   I really enjoyed all the vegetables in my dish and the different flavors.  

The service here is pretty quick and there's a unique style amongst the workers, definitely a fun and lively environment that I'm looking forward to next time.  I might try something else and see what else is good on the menu. The Smore's hot chocolate IS a must though!

Yelp Challenge-- 12/365"
4619,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You're going to wait a million years to get a table, but I'm willing to wait that long for Snickers pancakes that are bigger than my face, and the best biscuits and gravy everrrr. If you come here for breakfast and don't get pancakes, you're doing it wrong. This isn't the place to get the typical eggs and bacon. Get something fun, and you shouldn't be disappointed."
4620,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Plates are GIANT, food is nicely plated, and is super yummy. Service is great despite being very busy. One thing that bugged me that probably shouldn't have is that you have to pay for syrup. Like... really? That's the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars. Otherwise they're amazing and no local should leave Vegas without eating here first."
4621,Hash House A Go Go,5,Jesus Christ they give you a lot of food here so much in fact one meal here pretty much does me for the whole day. I guarantee you won't finish it all. Excellent location right on the strip inside Imperial Palace. The chicken and waffles is everything everyone says it is and is my personal favourite. I tried the Bloody Mary and granted it was relatively early around 11 am but there was so much booze in it I was drunk by the time I sipped the last drop no word of a lie. Not sure if the server just wanted a big tip but he wasn't shy with the vodka that is for sure. I looked around and seen towers of food on each table and couldn't quite believe the ride I was on; then again it could have been all that booze. Gotta check it out people!
4622,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Initially, I was excited to go as the Hash House in San Diego is great.

Yeay:  large portions, fresh and good quality ingredients.  I had the corned beef hash.  Hubby's Total Rewards card served as a speed pass, so we only waited 10 min when the regular wait was an hour.

Meh: slooow service (took 30 minutes for food to arrive), the vanilla waffle was more like a pancake shaped into a waffle-- very cakey and almost soggy, I was expecting something crisp and airy"
4623,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is my Go to spot to eat here in Vegas.  I've tried just about everything on the menu and everything has large portions and is delicious.  
This is literally the first spot I recommend to all of my friends visiting Vegas.  
Fun environment and great food and drinks.
I personally love the sage chicken Benedict and the enormous brown sugar and banana pancakes!  The sage chicken and waffles is also a great dish that draws a lot of attention. 
I have yet to come here and leave unsatisfied."
4624,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is the kind of place you should take your worst enemy. Order him a Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles. And when he's done and the blood flow to his brain has slowed to a trickle, stab him in the chest. Bitch ain't going nowhere."
4625,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Okay, this is what I am talking about, breakfast done right! Well, I had breakfast but they have other great selections that I'm sure are wonderful! The important thing about this for future hungry guest is to either A) Be on an extremely empty stomach or B) Share a plate with someone else, the portions are huge! I shared my plate with my boyfriend and my sister and husband shared there's. I was really surprised that the price of the plate was very reasonable for the amount of food we got. It was my cheapest meal on the Vegas Strip and the best. The service was great! Our waiter was amazing and very helpful. When I return to Vegas, this place will always be a must go to!"
4626,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Service is amazing, food is great, all around love the experience. We stayed at he LINQ and it was a short walk over. Loooove the corn beef hash. Must come here again!"
4627,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food was absolutely delicious! The portions are humongous and leave plenty of leftover. Come with a huge appetite because this place does not disappoint.
4628,Hash House A Go Go,3,Extremely big portions. You'll get tired halfway. Definitely need a doggy bag. Nothing special. I guess great value for your money.
4629,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Servings are huge. It's good but imo, it's way too overhyped. I've eaten here three times but I still don't feel like it's anything too special. I got the chicken and waffles and it was great. If you go here, I think you should definitely try it."
4630,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Holy food coma! I was ready to pass out after this huge meal! 

Ok so we had high expectations and they definitely lived up to them! The group I was with mostly ordered the burgers and the chicken and waffles. I had the ""baby"" burger which is not baby at all. It's gigantic, just one less patty (can we order off the kids menu?!) Either way I enjoyed it. The fries were so so. But my friend who got the chicken and waffles was very satisfied. 

The food came out pretty quickly but the service was whatever. It was an older woman with zero personality. She seemed irritated with basic menu questions (I mean, why are you a waitress then really ?) but it wasn't soo bad that it ruined our experience. 

I just wish Ãber wasn't intimidated out of the city. The taxi line was so long and it was a long walk back to our hotel after that meal. But that's at no fault of the restaurant lol. 

Just be prepared to either share your meal, have lots of leftovers or roll home slowly."
4631,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash house is located in the Linq Hotel, the wait is long but goes FAST and worth the wait! The restaurant is huge and the bar is great with so many options!  The menu is extensive and the portions are HUGE! Easily sharable, but there are so many good options, you want to try a few things!  Service was on it, especially considering how busy they are.  I cant wait to go back!"
4632,Hash House A Go Go,5,"WHOA. You must! Don't go at peak times, and expect a wait. If you time it right, you'll wait 15 mins. Time it wrong and it'll be 2 hours. Thankfully they're open 24/7! 

Ask your waiter to make recommendations, and then just go with 1 of 2 things:

Chicken Benedict or Tractor Pancacake Combo

These plates are HUGE and will serve 2-4."
4633,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had the chicken and waffles. The portions were incredibly huge. I had lots of leftovers, and despite having a fridge in my room, I decided not to bring any home. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. I wish I could recount/write more but was too hung over that morning to remember everything on the menu."
4634,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you're visiting Las Vegas you must try this place out! My fiancÃ© and I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was so freaking good! The mash potatoes were the best I've ever had!!! The portions are also good.. we shared one plate and were pretty full! 

The drinks are also good and a reasonable price! I will definitely come back next time I'm in town!"
4635,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Big portions (if you're sitting for 2 best to share), the only thing I couldn't get over was you couldn't get a side of hash browns. The place is named hash house.. Service was friendly, there was a half hour wait at about 11am to keep in mind. Had the chicken and waffles, everything cooked to perfection, chicken was juicy a bit more spice would have taken it over."
4636,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just found out about this restaurant during my last stay in Vegas. Food was delicious...shared a dish and still had leftovers! I was a bit leery, since it was located in the Imperial Palace and happily surprised. 

Since something happened with our order, we were even given a free bloody mary from their sweet manager!"
4637,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Totally enjoyed the chicken and waffles. The chicken was so tender and juicy, seasoned perfectly.   And the waffles were light and fluffy and stuffed with bacon on the insides.  I highly recommend this dish."
4638,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The portions here are outrageous. That's the biggest takeaway. It's seriously awful. There are a lot of hungry people on this planet and there must be less than 1% of the population that can handle the size of these portions. They must throw out thousands of food everyday. Share something. Seriously.

The food is very tasty though. To say that it's comfort food would be an understatement. You will need days to burn off whatever you eat here."
4639,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When in Vegas, a must-eat for us. Legendary portion size, and a full drink menu served 24/7. More locations to choose from, but up the escalator at the Linq was most convenient. Being from Indiana, we favor the Hoosier selections portion of the menu. The Breaded Tenderloin is very good as is- tenderloin pounded thin and the size of a hubcap. But, one modification for authenticity....hold the ketchup and add mayo! Pickle, onion and (no ketchup) would make the offering perfect, easily big enough to share! Pairs beautifully with the spicy Bloody. You may have a little wait in season, but well worth it!"
4640,Hash House A Go Go,4,i really love this restaurant it very original ... i think it a very unique looking place and serves very great portions of food my bf and his dad order biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon and i order the pancake..which was bigger then the plate.. my bf mom order a standard breakfast but they all look big and delicious and well made ..the prices were awesome .. the food taste really good so it was a good experience nome!!! not your run of the mill breakfast and brunch plate..it was like a homemade southern breakfast plate more of an old style which a high end plating.. which made it look fancy  lol t too oh they played a lot of johnny cash which tie everything together.. lol i love this place and will be going back!!!
4641,Hash House A Go Go,4,My mother was begging me and my brother to go here when we went to vegas so we finally went and man must i say the portions wore VERYYYY big if you go with another person I highly advise you to split whatever you get place was very busy and service was okay but our server billy did his best to make us happy overall the food was very good !
4642,Hash House A Go Go,4,Large portions and friendly staff. Biscuits and gravy were good while chicken and waffles were ok. Would come here again.
4643,Hash House A Go Go,3,"More than one person suggested this place to my wife before we went on our vacation to Vegas. They all had my hopes up, but expectations fell somewhat short. After you order I guess everyone receives this honey butter basted biscuit. This thing was huge. Tasted ok, but it was kinda dry. Presentation of the food was excellent. Some of the dishes look like works of art, but taste like something I can make in my own kitchen. Not bad, but not great either. A+ for presentation, but only 3 stars."
4644,Hash House A Go Go,1,"My wife and I were super excited to try this after seeing it on Man vs. Food so we made it a priority to eat lunch there.  We were seated fairly quickly but had terrible service from our waiter.  He took about 10 minutes just to bring me a soda because they had apparently run out of clean glasses.  How can a restaurant of this size, in a hotel of this size, in Vegas run out of clean glasses?

Anyway, our waiter kept disappearing for 5-8 minutes a time within the first 20 minutes of us being seated.  We finally got our order in and, no joke, it took 45 minutes to get our food.  My wife ordered the chicken eggs benedict and I got the meatloaf sandwich.  We were never given an explanation as to what took so long.  I guess because it's all fresh and whatnot, but a couple sat down next to us about 15 minutes after we were seated, got their food 10 minutes before ours even showed up and they were gone before us.  Really crappy service from the waitstaff.

As for the food, it was good but I think my opinion is heavily skewed by the bad service we got.  If any server or restaurant gives you a bad impression within the first 10 minutes, chances are isn't not going to get much better and you won't be blown away by the food no matter how good it is.  Once again, another over-hyped restaurant experience thanks to television.  I won't be giving this place another shot."
4645,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place started as a revolution, the location at the M casino was exquisite, that location has now closed, and apparently it took with it all of its grandeur and deliciousness. Giving it three stars because it wasn't totally disappointing but it lacks creativity and imagination, and of course flavor. Step it up guys, chicken and waffles was so five years ago!!!!!!!"
4646,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We tried this place during a May visit to Vegas.  We didn't plan on visiting this place, but we needed some breakfast and I remembered the name as we passed.  

First and foremost, the serving sizes are HUGE.  Come with an appetite, even if you share a plate, there is a lot of food.  

The food had great taste and good presentation. 

They have a lot of breakfast and brunch type foods, and that's what we had.  But they also had great looking options for lunch and dinner including some good looking burgers, salads, and sandwiches.   

The servers are overworked...our server seemed to forget us at least once, but this place does see a lot of business, so it's to be expected.  

Good price point and overall a fun and casual meal."
4647,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've said it before...I HATE BREAKFAST.  There's something about Hash House a Go Go that changes my mind, though.  Maybe it's the delicious Bloody Marys that can be had at 8 in the morning (yes, I DID get talked into buying the souvenir glass.  What?  It's all tilty and cute.).  Maybe it's the fact that this place is a stellar restaurant in an otherwise shitty hotel/casino...makes you feel like you've actually won in Vegas when you stumble upon it.  It might also be the fact that the food is inventive, sustainable, AND delicious (as well as HUGE).  AND there is good music pumping too (thankyoufornotplayingtechnoorpophere.)
Whatever it is, it comes down to this: the food and drinks were great, the service was amazing, and I was thrilled to actually be enjoying breakfast (something I RARELY make it to in Vegas).  The only thing I can complain about is the bench seats along the edge of the restaurant...I was forced to sit NEXT TO my husband instead of across from him.  THE HORROR!"
4648,Hash House A Go Go,4,Tried the Sage fried chicken Benedict due to the Man vs Food recommendation. Kids had the blueberry pancakes. Way too much biscuit for the Benedict but the taste was good and portions were pretty amazing. Great service too.
4649,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions and a lot of items to choose from, bring your appetite or share because you will leave with a doggy bag!
I know some people will see the huge line and become discouraged but don't- the short wait is well worth it!"
4650,Hash House A Go Go,5,"They told us it was a 40 minute wait, we were seated in 15 minutes. Food was exceptionally good."
4651,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I was so excited to finally eat here after seeing this place on television. I didn't get to go to the original, I had to SETTLE with the one at Imperial Palace. 

I think this place is more novelty than it is ""good eats"". They are doing one heck of a business here, so what do I know. 

After waiting about 1/2 hour we were seated in a haze of customers and servers. Our server came over pretty quick and I ordered one massive Bloody Mary which was dropped off pretty quick. I think it cost me 20 bucks. The server was very friendly and made some decent suggestions. 

My buddy opted for the chicken and waffles. It looked really good but he said that the waffles were soggy and really took away from the dish. I ordered the dish I saw on Man vs. Food, which was fried chicken, spinach, eggs, cheese, mashed potatoes and a bunch of other things. It was good but it really was just too much for the sake of being too much. 

I don't believe there are any Subway heart smart runner icon next to any menu item here.

The food was OK. I can now say I ate here.  After paying 60 bucks for two breakfasts and one drink,  I realize I could eaten very well for a few bucks more.

Its worth checking out if you take it for what its worth. It reminds me of Tony's in Birch Run Michigan http://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-i-75-restaurant-birch-run."
4652,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I had a great time here , I will explain later on , when i am certain of all the details ...."
4653,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Everyone is right on with 4 stars.   We had the Meatloaf (shared...it is HUGE) and it was good.  Added a couple of eggs and it was perfect.   I am not a big ""star effer"" but HHAGG is.  Pics with signatures everywhere (this is vegas, it doesn't surprise me that movie stars have to eat somewhere)   slammed into your face.  That is the -1 star.  Some people I bet enjoy this but really....WHO CARES?"
4654,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We have been impressed by the dimension of the plates - really big as written in other reviews!! We have taken french toasts at late night - an enormous plate but in the average, nothing OMG. Come here if you are really really hungry and want to have some more people-watching."
4655,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Mediocre at best. Slow service, had to stop a waitress from another section to ask for more water since we only saw our waitress twice. Food options were rather weird. I ended up getting the pancake with a side of bacon. Food was decent and edible."
4656,Hash House A Go Go,5,Anytime I am in Vegas I love Hash House breakfast. I always take people who haven't been while in Vegas. Went there in April with the family and the kids meal was huge that my god brothers probably could have shared but it was great watching them try to finish the huge pancake. Definitely go if you haven't visited.
4657,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I finally got a chance to eat at the place that supposedly serves ""twisted farm food."" It had been on my radar ever since I first saw it on Man v. Food. Staying at Imperial made it all the more tempting to just go there for each meal. In a rare showing of mercy to my wallet, I didn't do that.

Before going inside the dining area, you'll see a number of autographed portraits and menus. Adam Richman's is one of them. 

I decided to do takeout for dinner. While it was very tempting to just get the popular sage fried chicken and waffles, I was in a 1-pound stuffed burger mood. Oh, that'd be one pound of meat. The entire burger was probably closer to 2 lbs., although not quite there.

The mushroom and Swiss stuffed burger ($12.95) was amazing. Extremely juicy and gargantuan. Everything cooked perfectly. It was heaven just to see the melted Swiss and sauteed mushrooms. It's served with the cold fresh veggies on one bun half and the stuffed patty on the other half. Two big dill pickle slices in the burger. While the lettuce looked a bit wilted, that's probably only because everything stayed in the same closed takeout box for a few minutes.

I'm guessing they used a brioche bun. Very soft and inviting. I personally think it could have been better with a slight toasting on the flattop. This just felt like the Juicy Lucy I had in Minnesota a couple years back, just in steroidal form. I think the burger could be too greasy and too imposing for some people. Fork and knife might be required. I for one needed a larger mouth.

Burgers come with one side item of your choice. I got the basil pesto tossed crispy potatoes and enjoyed every bite. Great job on the crispy potatoes. It also had some broken-down diced tomatoes in there. The olive oil from the pesto collected a bit at the bottom of the plastic takeout container.

Dessert is served all day here, and one of the servers mentioned that some items (like the bread pudding) are for in-house dining only. Might expect up to a 15-minute wait on that bread pudding.

Breakfast includes french toast, flapjacks, and the Fried Chicken Benedict, all featured on the Man v. Food episode. I hope to get back there for some of those dishes.

I saw the plating of the sage fried chicken and waffles I spoke of earlier, and it's literally a tower of food. Three or four waffles for the base, some fried chicken on top of that, and a large knife to hold it all in place.

Even with all the inflated prices on the Vegas strip, I think it's well worth the price to come here. Check this elite spot out the next time you're in the area."
4658,Hash House A Go Go,4,Waited about 45 minutes and it was worth it. I ordered fried chicken with waffle and meatloaf hash with a side of biscuit and sausage gravy. Food came out a little slow. Portions were huge. I suggest sharing an order. Bacon waffle was sweet and savory. I loved it. Chicken was tender and had delicious crispy batter. Meatloaf hash was flavorful. The spinach and red peppers was a great complementary. Too much food. I don't know how anyone can finish 1 portion.
4659,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Dry fried chicken and mediocre waffles, poor service. Just because you have a lot of food doesn't mean its any great if its all subpar to supermarket fried chicken.  I can't recommend, especially after having Bru's Wiffles in Santa Monica. Doesn't even come close."
4660,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It took a long time to get our food, so our friend passed out at that table.  But that just added to our fun at 3am.  Once the food got there it was well worth the wait.  The Chicken and Waffles are legit.  We shared one order with 4 and there was plenty to go around.  The gravy makes this dish.  I think this meal is the perfect late night drunk food.  No hangover the next morning - so that's a win."
4661,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We landed in Vegas at 9:00 AM in the morning, dropped our bags off at the hotel, and went straight to Hash House A Go Go! Freaking delicious!"
4662,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I read the reviews but I'm sorry I don't understand the four and five stars.  This place was crazy busy but we only had to wait 20 minutes or so.  Very nice young man as our server, gave us drinks and plenty of time to choose from the large menu.  We looked around at the size of the portions of some of the items and were totally intimidated.  The server told us many people share but since we like different items we opted to each get our own.

I had a skillet that had stir fried veggies over scrambled eggs, potatoes and a bisquit that was huge and pretty good although mine didn't seem completely cooked in the middle, sort of doughy.  My husband had eggs, sausage, potatoes and again the bisquit.  My complaint, the eggs even though the server told us everything was cooked to order so things didn't come out at the same time, were rubbery and not piping hot and the potatoes were not good at all.  I want my potatoes to be crisp and don't want a bunch of seasonings that take away from the potato and add a lot of spice to them.  Mine were way over cooked so didn't eat most of them.

We go to Vegas a lot and will probably go back at some point since we'd like to give it another try.  Based on the other reviews we wondered if we just got a bad meal for a one time thing."
4663,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG!  This place satisfies every time!  The portions are so huge like the pork cutlet dish that feeds me and my three kids!  The pancakes are bigger than standard plate sizes.  The service is always great.  There is usually a long wait to get in, but it is worth the wait."
4664,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ridiculously huge portions for most eaters. We had two people at the table order the chicken and waffles and both agreed they should have just gotten one order and split it (because they didn't even get through half of their own portions). 

I'm a little on the fence about the place overall. Overall the food was good, but some of the condiments (like the homemade BBQ sauce) were not on point. And all the weird garnishes look cool in terms of presentation, but got in the way when actually eating. Some of the plates were overwrought. But still, if you want a really large breakfast meal to soak up booze, this is higher quality than most options for that.

It's very good, I just am not sure if it was great."
4665,Hash House A Go Go,1,"There is only one way anyone could possibly enjoy the bland taste of this frozen: microwaved food: You are totally plastered. That being said if you're hammered and just need to get some food in you, go for it, although you may wind up feeling like crap either way. No pun intended. If however you're sober and expecting dishes with taste and quality, save yourself the disappointment. If by chance you're there with someone, go ahead and drink a bloody mary or two until you can suffer the taste of the food. That is if you can stand the wait to get in or the worst service Las Vegas could ever dream of offering."
4666,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food was amazing! We had the salmon scramble, chicken Benedict, waffles and pancakes. Everything was fresh and delicious. Service was excellent! Good for kids too!"
4667,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is insanely good.  While waiting it was fun to take a picture with the Bull Statue near the entrance and read all the plaques on the walls from who had been there.

HUGE PORTIONS! - So be warned! 

I am from NJ and am used to diner food (large portions of home cooked comfort foods), but this was diner portions of creatively delicious comfort food. (they deep fried pasta!)

I would definitely go again!"
4668,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If your looking for good food on the strip at a good price and big portions, look no further.
Chicken and waffles are chicken and waffles, but here they are real big.
Go for the sage benedict plate, it's very tasty and a sight to behold.
The photos don't lie"
4669,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love this place, it's in the LINQ hotel on the 2nd floor and can't say enough good things.  Liz was our waitress this morning and yesterday we had Paninni.  They both killed us with kindness, great service and most importantly the coffee was AMAZING.  Be very careful the portions are huge."
4670,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Loved this place, from the line thought we were going to have to wait awhile...they told us like 30 mins. it was less than that, got seated and told about the menu and drinks...Me and my Wife decided to share the Sage Chicken and Bacon Waffles...yeah that right I typed Bacon Waffles...lol and let me tell you it was delicious...2 nice pieces of chicken and 4 Bacon Waffles....Bacon cooked on the inside of the Waffle..crazy right. It was sssoooooo good if you ever in Vegas you need to check this place out, strongly recommend...enjoy."
4671,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here around 11ish the morning after Christmas and the wait for a party of 4 was about 30 minutes or so.  Not too bad considering how packed it was!
A solid 5 stars for the food!!  We ordered the chorizo hash, the bacon/avocado scramble with griddled mashed potatoes, sundried tomato/goat cheese scramble with crispy potatoes, and the brown sugar banana pancake (a must-try!).  The portions were HUGE and awesome.  The 4 of us were starving when we came in and barely finished half of all the food we ordered.  Definitely recommend sharing!
Minus 1 star for the waiting area (very cramped and not a lot of space to sit or stand while you wait), noisy (the hostess screams the name of each party as tables become available and it can get annoying...also difficult to hear her over all the people...they should use a microphone/speaker system).  Also, the restaurant itself was kinda dim/dark and not the cleanest.  Service was okay, not great, not horrible, but got the job done.
Overall, a great brunch spot with great food (and portions), if you don't mind all the noise!"
4672,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I was a little skeptical about the food at first. I associate large portions with poor quality. But the food was really good. I had the chicken & waffles and we split the gigantic pancake. Both were delicious, albeit enough for a small family. Definitely my go to place for breakfast when in LV."
4673,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've tried the one at the M Hotel a few years back and was very impressed. This location was super busy because its in the heart of the Strip. If you have a large group, be prepared to wait for 30-45 minutes just to be seated. I suggest to snack on something along the way or while waiting for your name to be called. Better yet, grab a big cocktail from the casino bar and wait...hey, you're in Vegas baby :)  We were here on Saturday 11:30am and it was already packed and we were starving. I suggested to eat here because the portions are huge and food is quite delicious. Luckily the bar had a quicker turnaround...perfect for just a couple of fellows. I got the same thing - Andy's sage fried chicken, served w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. (See My Pic) My friend ordered the Griddled French Toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup. As much as we tried to finish the meal, we had to surrender. My goodness, food coma...here we come. Thank God we just planned to hang by the pool and lush out...lol. Overall, Hash House is a good bang for your buck. Our counter server was quick and came by 3x to make sure we got everything we needed.  The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is clearly enough for 2 but like what I said earlier...you're in Vegas!  Splurge a little :)  They have different locations so check their website but this one in particular is not as nicely decorated as the one in M Resort. This location is extremely busy and felt tight but its open 24 hours. The M Hotel location has more tables and outdoor seating with nice views."
4674,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Alright, so here's the deal with this place. My husband and I have a hard time finding restaurants that will please us both. I am
More of a foodie. He hates anything pretentious with small servings. This place is our happy medium. Good food , LARGE servings and a hipster ambience. Love the one in San Diego. Vegas location has a totally different vibe...kinda trashy and in a crappy casino. Food was still good though."
4675,Hash House A Go Go,5,Absolutely my most favorite breakfast place EVER!! Spent a while on yelp looking for a good place to have breakfast and I'm so glad that I chose this place! About an hour wait but well worth the wait. They make the best mash potatoes and I had their salmon scramble and it was amazing. I can't wait to go again someday (hopefully soon)!
4676,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food and service were decent but the wait time was over an hour. I didn't think it was worth the wait time. 

The portions are huge! I got the breakfast quesadilla and was able to eat it over two meals. Hubby got the chicken sandwich which he thought was ok. Our friends got the chorizo scramble and they loved it. 

I also recommend getting the BLT Bloody Mary. Hubby loved his and he's usually super picky about his bloody."
4677,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had to come and see what the fuss was about. I have heard of the huge portion size, but the food is touted as better than most. I am usually disappointed by places like this, but it really was good. I had the meatloaf, which was awesome. The pancakes are 18 inches across and the banana brown sugar is by far the best of those. Biscuits are heavy and roughly the size of a softball. What surprised me most about Hash wad the pricing. I swear I would spend more at Denny's. Awesome bang for your buck in the town that takes all your money. Can't wait to come back and try some other entrees!"
4678,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Got this recommendation from the bellhop at Mandalay and he was sooooo right. Really loved this place. They had an Indiana motif which I thought was kinda cool because that's where I'm originally from. Our server was really cool, don't remember his name, but he had a ginormous Mohawk. He recommended the Chicken and waffles, which I got and the Corned beef skillet, which my tita ordered. Honestly the portions are wayyyyy too big, but it's Vegas, it's what you do. My sister's corned beef was out of this world. Fresh, not canned, potatoes on point, and biscuit soft and buttery. The chicken and waffles were pretty good too. The waffles had strips of bacon cooked into it, and omg. So freaking good. Sis and I both decided that this is a MUST everytime in Vegas. Oh and make sure you get your ""roadie"" on too."
4679,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The quantity is huge! And most times when you get quantity you tend to pass up quality but not this time, the flavor was really good! I got the banana foster French toast and it was pretty damn good. My only complaint is how loud it is in the restaurant.  I was there with 3 friends of mine and i could barely talk to them because I couldn't hear them! Honestly the surrounds and loud music really pull this place down, maybe then the music down a bit and then m rating will go up."
4680,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ehhhhhhhhhhh. 
Insanely expensive. $7 glass of orange juice. The plate portions are immense though!! I'm putting it at a three stars for poor service and the friend chicken being super dry. I was really disappointed in this one."
4681,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was A grand slam. Staff, atmosphere, price, food presentation was OMG perfection! Definitely a return visit for me...."
4682,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food, service, and price!

When I was planning my trip to Vegas, I did some research on places to eat and this was very high on the list. One of the main reasons was because it was featured on Man vs. Food.

My friend and I decided to eat here for breakfast and I wasn't disappointed at all. I decided to try the ""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict"", mainly because this is what was featured on Man vs. Food. It had everything in it: mashed potatoes, bacon, cheese, friend chicken, egg, tomatoes, spinach, and a sauce (I think I probably left some stuff out). The portion was HUGE! For $18, this single plate could feed about 2-3 people.

We also got the bacon waffles which were good. The waffles were light and airy with the bacon cooked in to it.

Lastly, the Smore's Hot Chocolate was delicious! Take my recommendation; it's amazing :)"
4683,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This Place is a Hidden Gem !!! You get to go to Plush New Hotels along the Strip. Fancy Decor ...Fancy Enticing Buffet . But This Restaurant is inside Imperial Hotel an Old hotel Front of 5 Star Cesar Palace .. Line can be long but the wait is worthy!! Ordered hash with Chorizo!! Did I finish? It's HUGE!! Our server JASON has the Best Convincing power to make you Hungry long before he explains all the food on Menu on Detail!! 

Lastly I found this Gem through the help of all Yelpers here!!"
4684,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Overall my experience was good. After we sat down our waitress swung by to say she'd be right with us. It was mid breakfast, so the place was pretty full. It did take a long time to get water though. Our waitress was friendly & knowledgeable about the food. She had good suggestions, and we had a good experience with her. The portion size is definitely huge! 

I got the biscuits & gravy! Being that I lived in the south I had high expectations! The gravy was phenomenal, but the biscuit was a bit dry. My friend go the hot & sticky granola & it came with an assortment of fruit. It looked delicious & she seemed to enjoy it! 

We enjoyed our breakfast, the atmosphere was nice. I just think next time I would go during a time of day where I knew it might not be as busy."
4685,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was great the food is enough to feed an army. You'll definitely walked out staffed and have some left over for the next few days.
4686,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place.
Large portions. Very large!
His is my first time at the Vegas location and it's huge and good looking inside."
4687,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Come with an appetite! This place serves huge portions! I've been before for breakfast and this time I tried the chicken and waffles. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The waffles have bacon cooked inside. I tried the gravy also and it was amazing! My boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak, but doesn't like gravy, so I tried it and will definitely be ordering something with gravy the next time I come. He even liked it and he doesn't like gravy at all. I wish I had room for dessert, but always end up with at least one meal boxed up and very full!"
4688,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is great! The portions are huge so it's ideal to split one meal with two people or even three, that's how big the portions are. I went for breakfast with my family and it was a great. Had a lot of food to take home but I would 100% recommend"
4689,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Rachael was quick, attentive and energetic. The food was delicious. Big portions and a great atmosphere. Thank you, Rachael!!"
4690,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Bloody Mary while you wait? -Why yes, I think I will.  Seriously, it was a very good bloody mary.  I also decided that if I was going to indulge, I may as well try the Andy's sage fried chicken ( a Man vs. Food menu item).  As the other reviews mention, it s HUGE.  Fortunately, the taste matches the portion size.    A great find for your Vegas morning."
4691,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait was long. So grab a pager, pull $20, and play 25 cent video poker downstairs while waiting.  The portions were huge...seriously you could feed three people with every entree.  But where's the fun in that?  I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict and my friend ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  We were both in awe of the genius of having strips of bacon in the waffle batter.  The food was great and definitely worth the wait.  I'll definitely be back on my return visit in Vegas in July."
4692,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Excellent breakfast place on the Strip.    There is a bit of a wait time to be seated and the service can be a little slow at times, but the food itself is excellent.  The portions are so huge that two people can easily share many of the entrees.    The pancakes are as big as a medium-sized pizza!  The coffee is good, and cups are kept refilled."
4693,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Very disappointed. Was drawn in by the 'chicken pot pie' - it was a huge disappointment. Nothing traditional about it & flavors did not pair well at all. Unfortunately, a wasted meal on my end."
4694,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Soooooooo good. I wish I lived here, I wanted to try several of the dishes. I decided I on the salmon. PERFECT is all I can say."
4695,Hash House A Go Go,5,Really great spot. I went for brunch and went with the Man v. Food menu item--Andy's Sage Fried Chicken! It was so much food. I knocked out about 1/4 of it so would be much better to share. The cocktails looked pretty incredible too.
4696,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I hated the service here. We got seated quickly but apparently, the hostess never told a waiter we were there and we waited for about 15-20 minutes until we finally asked a waiter when someone was going to serve us. We saw the waiter tell the hostess and all she did was walk off. Then about ten minutes later, the waiter comes up to us and says, ""well, since no one else wants you, I'll go take your order."" Seriously? He said it in a joking tone, but I still thought it was rude. 

The food was alright too. I don't know what all the hype is about. I guess the portions are really big and the presentation of the food was nice, but it's not like the taste was extraordinary. If you like quantity better than quality then this place is for you."
4697,Hash House A Go Go,4,Portion sizes are enormous.  Reasonably priced for Vegas.  We liked the chicken and waffles and came back a second time.  Overall a pretty great place for breakfast.  Down side is that it is crowded and can get pretty noisy.
4698,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The only thing impressive is the size of their food

Food not very impressive just big.  I had the chicken and waffles and it was a bit greasy. The giant biscuits were good and the waitress was very friendly."
4699,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Server was not very considerate and constantly trying to rush us for brunch. I ordered the roasted chicken, peppers, asparagus, and rosemary hash with egg whites and half order of potatoes. Alright quality, way too much oil and not much added flavor/spice. Portion wasn't what I expected (yes, even though I got 1/2 potatoes). However, my friend got a pancake that was ENORMOUS. I tried it and it was very good and cooked perfectly. Perhaps I just got a subpar dish for this place or I was expecting more, but overall I was not impressed and would have been more pleased at a Waffle House (from Georgia)."
4700,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow to some of the reviews. Let me start off by stating our experience at the Imperial Palace Hash House was great. Our waitress was great, a little mix up with splitting the bill at the end, but was quickly resolved, mistakes happen, and it was a bit confusing. 

Ok, to those who rated it so horribly, besides having bad service, our waitress informed us that the wait for our food would be longer than usual because they don't have microwaves or pre-made items, or heat lamps. Therefore the food you receive is fresh and all our food was served HOT. I would gladly wait longer for fresh food than Denny's or McDonalds pre-made items. 

This place is known for it's portion size. SOOO for people to judge harshly on having huge portions is ridiculous! When the Hash House was on Man V. Food it showed the huge portions, so don't complain especially when the price is not expensive for being in Las Vegas!!!

I have eaten at many places on the strip and this by far is one of the best, because of the portions for the price. I had the stuffed burger with avocado, bacon and cheese and their side house salad. It was SOOO good. I couldn't finish all mine, but guess what I took it with and ate the rest later!

I will return to this Hash House, and will be trying the San Diego one in the future."
4701,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here after an early morning flight to Vegas. We arrived, checked into our hotel, took a nap and then went out to eat... yeah I know... we're old!

I saw the pics and reviews of this place and book marked it before I even arrived in Vegas =)

At about 9:30 am we had about a 20 min wait. Once seated our server seemed a bit frazzled and overly busy so everything, including our food and drinks seemed to arrive a bit late. 

We ended up ordering a veggie hash with scrambled eggs and fruit on the side. It was pretty darn good and the eggs were cooked perfectly. 

Next time I think I'll opt for a giant pancake or sandwich. Keep in mind that the portions are huge so if you aren't super hungry its a good idea to share a meal. 

I'll come back again for breakfast/brunch the next time I'm in Vegas."
4702,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had. The chicken and waffles are amazing and plated beautifully. The brown sugar and banana pancake is a must have. Bloody Mary's are awesome as well. The portions are HUGE and definitely shareable. 100% recommend this place!
4703,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Wouldn't recommend - huge portions ( not humanly possible to eat ), chicken pot pie not good at all - gravy tasted like it was from a packet and looked like mayo"
4704,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our first morning, well afternoon in Las Vegas would be started with breakfast(lunch) at Hash House A Go Go in Las Vegas. Friday afternoon, no waiting for a table can't get much better than that. After patronizing their San Diego location we were more than happy to know there would be a location on the strip waiting for us during my birthday celebration weekend. Our waiter was so attentive and on top of things. I love it when I do not have to ask for more napkins or a refill on water. 
I had the lovely cheeseburger - not realizing that it's either one patty split, or two actual patties with all the fillings in between. It was served with a side of mac & cheese (cheesy, gooey, tasty), and I tried to finish as much as I could. My friends ordered one of the benedicts entree's and a salmon scramble dish. No complaints from our whole table. We ordered one banana pancake to share and sure enough we couldn't finish the huge flapjack. 
Reasonably priced, full bar, something on the menu for everyone. It's definitely a must-have while in Las Vegas (or San Diego). Bring your appetite and good luck if you can finish your plate!"
4705,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is pretty damn awesome! We came here on the weekend and it was so busy. Weekdays seem more calm. I recommend the sage chicken and waffles. Delicious and the waffles have bacon in them! Our server Bree (sorry if that's spelled wrong) today was knowledgeable of the menu and had a great vibe. I would definitely recommend this place.
4706,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Totally super sized entrees..flavors were good and service top notch!!! I just wish they had a variety of desserts, we went someplace else for dessert and coffee. 

We had the sage fried chicken and waffles, mushroom and Swiss burger and I had the corned beef hash. The kids had grilled cheese sandwich..Which we had to return cuz they made it on wheat bread (cmon now...for a kids meal? Use the good sour dough stuff...not wheat!) so my kid got a burger instead and the other kids had the giant chocolate pancakes. Flavors of each dish were pretty good, fried chicken was super tasty and my corned beef hash delicious..burger was ok, good flavor and cooked perfect medium rare. 

My only complaint was that the food was obnoxiously huge...at least it packed flavor..otherwise could come off very  gimmicky. 

Waiter was awesome!"
4707,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Absolutely Loved this place!! When I came there was a 5 minute wait not bad for a place well known. I ordered the Chicken Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had ordered the meatloaf and hash. The restaurant wasn't at all busy which was great for us because then we'd get better service and have our food out faster. Unfortunately the server we were given with was really nice when he did come around but for the most part disappeared. I watched the other servers and seen that they kept checking on their tables making sure that their drinks were refilled and if everything was going well. Our Server only came around to take our order, drop off our food, and drop off the bill. The rest of the time I never even saw him around the area. When our food came we tripped out on the portions because they were HUGE!! The flavor was yummy nothing like I have ever tasted!! and the price was really affordable.."
4708,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went here based upon the yelp reviews. One hard thing about yelp is that it is one overall review and is not broken into categories. I had the chicken and waffles because of the reviews and I thought they were just ""meh"" they weren't bad just nothing earth shattering. My wife had a burger and it was the same thing. As far as value goes I would give it 5 stars. You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck. If you are looking for large quantities of food for reasonable prices then this is your place. If you want a high quality pleasant dining experience I would look elsewhere. Also I did not personally care for the decor and ambiance. It is dark inside and because it is upstairs it was hot. Overall I would say not bad just so so. Service was acceptable but nothing over the top. If I was in Vegas with a group of guys looking to throw down I would definitely come back. If you are just out with the wife looking for a nice date I would go elsewhere."
4709,Hash House A Go Go,5,"While in Vegas, I just HAD to swing by HHaGG to check it out.   

At first, I was really concerned that at 4:30 in the afternoon, the hostess told me it was a 45 minute wait.   A couple of groups before me got on the list and then decided to head on down to the casino for 20-30 minutes of gambling while they waited.   Great plan... right?   Nope.   I thought I would just chill for a bit and play games on my phone.   Much to my surprise, my name was called about 5-6 minutes later.   Apparently... EVERYONE ahead of me thought they would go down to the casino and weren't there when it was their turn.   Woo-hooo!!   

This time I ventured into the world of the dinner menu.   I love love love my breakfast foods, but I'm in Vegas and this is my way of gambling as a warmup to the real gambling (*wink*).   I gave the #2 Stuffed Burger a go go (Pepper Jack, Guac, wax pepper, jalapeno, bacon, and queso cheese).  Good golly miss Molly... this was a big ol' burger with n elbow dripping mess about to happen.   If you are a dainty eater... stay clear of this bad boy.   Thankfully... I'm not a dainty eater.   I dove into this beast and trembled as the sheer joy of gluttony washed over me.   Dude... this was a beast of a burger and would have been worth the 45 minutes that I didn't have to wait.  

I'm all in on HHaGG now... I look forward to more cheat days on my diet to stuff myself silly on a new menu item.  Yum Yum Yum."
4710,Hash House A Go Go,5,First time here. Sooooooo good! I had the famous chicken and waffles. The chicken was so crispy and flavored well. The sage really stood out and I luved it. While I was working my way through the waffles I discovered bacon inside them. How great is that! The portion was so big I was able to take the leftovers home and eat them for dinner and breakfast the next day. I also had the old school hot chocolate. Delicious! A must stop.
4711,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is awesome! HUGE portions and very excellent food. I don't think you could get anything bad here. The service is very quick and they get a lot of people in and out. 10/10 will go again :)
4712,Hash House A Go Go,2,"If you want to gorge yourself on a shitton of food, then this HHAGG is your place.
Located inside a maze of a hotel (I'll give them the fact that they're remodeling) we are seated in a strange room of booths. The interior is dim and uninviting.

Our waiter was alright, but seemed a bit frazzled. He kept repeating the items I was ordering with different names than what I was reading off the menu. He also gave an air of irritation because I was just listing off the orders for everyone at the table.

This place is the perfect example of quantity over quality.

Although the food wasn't bad, it wasn't stellar and definitely not food that I'd recommend to others or return for. Sometimes having two huge heaping mounds of smoked salmon on giant biscuits and mashed potatoes is just TOO much. Even when shared amongst two people.

The sage fried chicken was moist, but lacking in flavor. There was nothing special about the dish. I didn't taste any sage, the syrup was regular ole maple syrup. 

The style of hash was boring. Shredded dry meat. Potato cubes. It didn't hit the spot at all. And the gigantic looming biscuit was dry and brittle and really just a sponge to soak up any grease.

For our party of 7, we were seated within 10 minutes on a Saturday morning around 9am.

Maybe other locations in the chain are better, but this one I will not be returning to."
4713,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing breakfast!! HUGE portions. Corned beef hash & banana pancake is delicious & shareable. Service with Scotty was above & beyond!
4714,Hash House A Go Go,4,"HH review

First recommendation do not get the pineapple juice mimosa. I love pineapple juice but these two were not meant to be mixed together. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and DMD ordered the cheddar burger. Our waitress was adorable, and very attentive. 
Both our meals were very good, but the presentation of the waffles and chicken the table got next to us was spectacular. I was told they have one of these in Orlando, but if never heard if it. We were not disappointed"
4715,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions and really yummy! We had the sage fried chicken pasta, that was gory and delicious."
4716,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you are in Vegas and don't make it a point to eat here then shame on you. This is a must place to eat while visiting Las Vegas and especially if you have an appetite for some very LARGE portions of food or looking for an economical way, since you have lost your a** gambling, to split a meal this is your place.

We have eaten at the location in San Diego and this location did NOT disappoint. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin sandwich which literally is at least 4 to 5 inches outside of the bun with fries. My wife ordered the Chicken sandwich which measure about 8 inches high. It is a crusted chicken breast smothered between two huge garlic cheese toast slices. For a side dish (which is included) we ordered the smothered mash potatoes, OMG are they good. They are a meal by themselves. 

The service matches the high quality of the food which makes the entire dining experience a perfect 5 stars. Needless to say we are still eating the leftovers today. 

Do yourself a favor, don't get sucked into all the crappy food all over the strip, take my word for it, this place is the best. Enjoy!!!"
4717,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I just want to start off by saying I went with a big party of 10 on a Friday night to the Hash House, we did not have to wait but maybe 10 mins for a table, our server was Brad, Brad was extremely attentive, helpful, went above the line of duty, and made sure our table was happy. When I said above the line of duty, for most of us it was our 1st time there and 2 ordered the same sandwich and when one got it, the other friend was just commenting to us oh if I knew it had chopped peppers on it I would have ask to have that removed, when Brad brought her dish out, the peppers were not even their! He was an excellent server! 


I spilt an order of Fried Green Tomato stack with a friend, and when it came out, it was very eye pleasing. So bright with color and stacked beautifully! It was thick slices of fried green tomatoes, feta cheese, a chicken salad between layers & sweet tangy balsamic vinaigrette drizzled all over it. Oh My Gawd!!! That was some delicious heaven!! Was sad when it was all gone, just talking about it now is making me want it again!

I also ordered the cheddar, bacon avocado hamburger with horseradish mash potatoes. WOW that's a huge burger; I could only eat a quarter of it and that's with removing one of the patties, the bun was perfect, it held everything together, firm yet soft, the cheese was real sharp cheddar the bacon were soft crispy strips that just melted in your mouth, the avocado, oh man that was the best, so fresh, so creamy just yum!! The horseradish potatoes were perfect! Now I ate most of them, couldn't stop, they were sooo good but because of that, only ate a  of my burger.    

I look forward to coming back! So many things to still try!"
4718,Hash House A Go Go,5,HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!! Chicken & Waffles the size of Mt. Everest  I made the mistake of stopping here Friday morning as soon as we got to Vegas. Let's just say I knocked out until that evening. The portion sizes are huge and definitely worth the cost. My sister got the meatloaf hash and she loved it too! We were sooooo greedy we went back on Sunday before leaving Vegas .
4719,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food, big portions at a very low price point. But the weights are just too long. It took us more than an hour to get a table. They have the best chicken and waffles. Me and my husband were stuffed after eating the whole portion. Kiwi Watermelon lemonade was a hit as well."
4720,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place gets super busy!  Make a reservation before if you can!  I was lucky enough to find a seat at the bar top without waiting 45 min for a table.  I had an AMAZING smores mocha!  It was incredible.  Melted marshmallows on top!  And of course, my friend and I had to split the chicken and waffles.  HUGE portions!  The service was great too!  

For some reason I had no cell phone service in the restaurant though.  Bummer.  ATT problem?!"
4721,Hash House A Go Go,3,Decent place for Breakfast. It had a longer wait than most places and then we waited for our food for a long time but once it was out it was decent.
4722,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One word......OMG!!!  Oh wait...maybe that's 3 words...oh well.  The portions are huge, ginormous, humongous...and you can't help but take pictures of what you're about to devour...without success.

This place is located inside the Imperial Palace, where all this constructions are going on and you can't even the find the proper entrance to the hotel.  Crappy hotel and casino, but Hash House is a hidden gem.  

We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 4, but well worth it.  The food wasn't just huge in portion, it was actually good.  Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, BBBLT, Sausage Gravy Pot Pie, and the Scramble were all very tasty dishes and a perfect cure for the hangover from the night before.

Service can be a bit slow, but who cares when you get to watch everyone else get the most ridiculous meals?  I wanted to walk over to some tables and take pictures of their food too!  Ridonculous!!!"

4724,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We just happened to stop by here during our annual family vacation to Vegas. My parents wanted to go to Guy Fieri's something or other but when we tried to go there they said they would unfortunately be closed due to some sort of fire alarm issue. What a happy accident that was because low and behold this amazing breaskfast place. Our waiter was excellent and you could tell he genuinely loved his job. He said he was a 10 yr veteran of the store and proceeded to give us a run down of the menu. Just a forewarning, the portions are enormous! Our waiter let us know that if we wanted pancakes don't even try to order more than one because there's no point you will not need it. These were very wise words! I ordered the Banana Pancake with Brown sugar and house made whipped cream as he recommended. This was THE BEST pancake I have EVER had!!!!! I really wanted to finish the whole plate but there was no way! Every single bite was filled with delicious chunks of banana and brown sugar. The texture was a perfect consistency of crispy and softness where it should be. My Dad ordered a skillet meal and we'll, you guessed it, they literally brought it out to him in a skillet! My husband also had a pancake, he got the classic one and he absolutely loved it. He made the mistake of ordering bacon/sides with it, I say mistake only because you will not have any room. Seriously you must make this a part of your trip to Vegas! Hands down this place blows any other breakfast here out of the water! Also the Nitro Cold Brew Coffee was of course heavenly as well!! You will not regret giving his place a try! I have been craving that pancake ever since... mmmmm!!!"
4725,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was our first stop from the airport! My husband and I were so hungry! He was craving chicken and waffles so we googled a chicken and waffle place and this is what we decided to go with. 

I got the two eggs any style with toast, sausage, and potatoes. Nothing original. But when my husbands food came out, it was so beautiful to eat! He ordered chicken and waffles that was piled high. The waffles had an excellent crunch to it and the chicken was not dry at all. I was in awe. I took photographs of his food and forgot to take a photograph of mine!

I was so jealous..."
4726,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Not sure why all the good reviews. Basic comfort food, way over priced and nothing amazing, though portions are large. Chicken and waffles (their speciality) was just plain bad, chicken was super dry. Also service was slow and very rude. Waitress kept asking us of we were done since her shift was ending and needed to get our check done. Word to the wise avoid this place."
4727,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Open 24 hours at the Linq hotel- this place was phenomenal with reasonable prices! 

I got the chorizo hash- which was sooo flavorful- with a nick kick to it! 

The whole menu looked really good- I honestly wanted to order everything. 

Their breakfast items of pancakes, waffles, and French toast looked amazing! 

Definitely wish I would have found this place earlier on in my trip. 

I highly recommend this place and will definitely  return."
4728,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I went to Hash House A Go Go because I didn't really know where to go for a cheap breakfast while we stayed at the Venetian. The food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing either. Customer service wasn't bad though. Our server was pretty good and he tried to crack some jokes. Unfortunately, hung over girls that are hungry don't want to laugh- they just want to eat. He was funny in retrospect.

I had the salmon eggs benny while my boyfriend had the chicken and waffles. I remember sitting back and while we were waiting for our food to come. We were silently pointing and laughing at people that were getting these massive plates delivered to their tables. I was like ""I'm SO glad that's not what I order"" WRONG! It was totally what I ordered. I just looked at my plate and my hang over was gone... and so was my appetite. There was way too much hollandaise sauce on my eggs benny. There was also just too much of everything. I had maybe a total of 3 bites of this thing, then I wanted to just look away and not eat for a week. My boyfriend's dish wasn't too bad though. There was bacon built into the waffle and the waffle was pretty soft. 

It really wasn't bad at this place, but I just didn't want to die of a heart attack. I felt it coming as soon as I took a forkful of the potatoes and biscuits drenched in a rose hollandaise sauce. Come here if you're really hungry. The price was amazing for the amount of food you get. Got damn."
4729,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was good but you probably should share a plate.

I got the Man V Food Fried chicken benedict.
The first three bites were great but thereafter it felt WAY too heavy.
Pretty tastey though. 

Minus one star for the misleading weight.  1 hour and 15 minute wait.  We checked back in and they had already called us and made us wait another 15 minutes. Then when we were sat we were told it would be 30 minutes for the food to come out. thats 2 hours before we even got a bite.

Food was pretty good but Im not a fan of waiting 2 hours for food.

Server was very nice and personable."
4730,Hash House A Go Go,4,Chicken and Waffles..better  come with a B I G appetite cause the portions are HUGE..best one i had so far...but ne thing was since they sat us all the way in the back seemed like they almost forgt about us being there...8P
4731,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hash House has a lot of hype which made me think this place would be really really exceptional.  The wait is a bit ridiculous, but the reviews say so much.  After being seated my lady and I still waited about 45mins for our food to come.  Our waiter was Drew...he was average. We heard him being REALLY generous and informative with other tables but we only got the basic waiter conversation. I ordered the chicken and waffles which was really really good!  I've never tasted anything like it.
It was definitely a huge amount of food, more than I expected. I would still visit again but not when it's busy."
4732,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Servings are HUGE here.  I had the meat loaf (which was awesome), but the couple at the next table ordered a pot pie. It was ginormous, and it looked so good!"
4733,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was a relieving change of pace for us.  It's nice to pay for what food is actually worth in Vegas.  The portions are enormous; you'd be well advised to split entrees here.

I had the banana French Toast and was thoroughly pleased."
4734,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was the first place my wife and I ate at when we arrived in Vegas. Holy Pancake! The portion sizes are fantastic! We shared a Tractor Driver Combo with a pancake, sausage and eggs. We were both stuffed! As we were eating I saw a plate go by that looked interesting...Chicken Benedict! I will for sure be back to try that out."
4735,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was phenomenal! Huge portions and excellent service. Got the chicken and waffles, wow, just wow. Two huge chicken breasts and 3 waffles. I had a little trouble finishing it! I also bought a banana brown sugar crusted pancake to take home for breakfast the next day.. The pancake was the size of the entire pizza box. Definitely recommend coming here to  anyone in Vegas"
4736,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came here two days in a row! First day we ordered the sage chicken eggs benedict... Wowsers on the flavor and textures! No wonder is was featured on Man Vs Food. Love it! Second day, we had the corned beef hash... perfect recovery food: salty, tasty, crispy, and slightly greasy. Everything you'd want in a homemade corned beef hash. Must see for tourists, like me... EPIC portions! Seriously, three people could share a plate."
4737,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We ate at Hash House last night, and as usual it was great. We had the loaded burger and the BLT. The service was great and we got our order pretty fast. The only thing I did not like was the soft croutons in my salad. They must be a specialty type of crouton, they're not hard they're big and soft. No matter what State I'm in, Hash House is always a winner."
4738,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Definitely worth the wait! 30 minutes for Saturday brunch! Had to go with my usual - Chicken & Waffles, fresh-squeezed OJ - split due to it's enormous portions! Multiple locations offer consistently delicious dishes; however, this one at The Linq is 24/7 versus at Rio."
4739,Hash House A Go Go,5,"#1 Place to visit for breakfeast when we come to Vegas, for taste and value. Be patient because it does take a while to get food and beverages. They could also improve on the biscuits, I'm from the South so I have high expectations when it come to biscuits."
4740,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Got here on a busy Sunday for brunch and there was a huge line, I expected that. I didn't care because I love brunch and I've been dying to try to this place!! Once we got seated, the waiter took drink jerseys and recommended their kiwi watermelon lemonade so I ordered one because it sounded amazing! I mean, who doesn't like watermelon?!?!  However, I was a little disappointed with the drink because it was overly sweet from kiwi syrup and I couldn't taste any watermelon. We ordered the chicken hash and fried chicken Benedict. It took them 45 mins to bring our food out and I was not a happy camper. Good thing the food was delicious and the Benedict even had a kick to it! Just like all the other reviews, the portions were huge! You can easily order one entree and share between two people. I was so full from this meal this ended up being my only meal for the day. I was feeling unhealthily full. Overall the food here was very good and definitely worth trying out at least once. I personally will not be back any time soon due to the wait time for food and how unhealthy I felt after the meal."
4741,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I like a good breakfast, but certainly not enough for a constant 45+ minute wait. My mom and i decided to have breakfast (well, closer to lunch) here and hoped that we would be okay since it was a random Tuesday in November. Nope. There were hordes of people waiting in front of Hash House as we came up the escalator. We were told it would be a 40-45 minute wait, so we decided to shop and explore in that time. I found it strange/annoying that they don't use the buzzing pager devices to call tables, just a PA system for the last chance after shouting. Anyway, we came back at the correct time and were seated (happily for us, in a roomy banquette booth with a view of the main room). Even after ogling the gargantuan portions on other tables, we decided to have our own items so we could try more and just take any leftovers back to the room. My mom ordered the signature sage fried chicken and eggs breakfast, while i tried the special, a skillet (forget the name) with grilled steak, corn, green beans, roasted tomatoes, and mozzarella, with two eggs over medium. We also shared hot chocolate; it came in a giant mug, was a big mess covered in drizzled syrup, and didn't taste very different from Swiss Miss. Our entrees were both pretty good, but nothing to rave about really. I did appreciate that the steak chunks in my skillet were only cooked to no more than medium. Her fried chicken (their star dish) was tasty, but the chicken we had at Yardbirds the night before had been better by miles. Overall, fun menu but I wouldn't go back unless there was (magically) no wait."
4742,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've eaten at HH in San Diego and pestered my friends into going while we were in LV, so my hopes were pretty high. 

We went on a Saturday around noon, called ahead but they don't take reservations on the weekends or day-of. Our wait time was an hour and an additional 30m at the table once we ordered. It was extremely crowded, but the crowd cleared by the time we were done eating around 2:30.

The food was just okay and not the same compared to my visit in San Diego. I ordered the same exact thing (chicken with potatoes, etc) and this plate came out saltier, drier and just not as mind-blowing.

Don't think it's worth the wait or crowd, but really do love the menu. I do have to say that what the food lacked, the service made up for - that was superb. And their bloody's are bloody good!"
4743,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food with super huge servings.  My husband and I shared the chicken and waffles and it was perfect serving for the two of us.  There is always a wait but i will tell you that is was well worth it.  Located on second floor of quad resort.  Hostess and servers all friendly and food comes with fast service.
4744,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Who knew this trendy breakfast / brunch place on the strip was going to be good??  Awesome bloody's, large portions, and fast svc.  What more do u need the morning after in Vegas?  :). Go early cause their will be a long wait."
4745,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Having been to the OG Hash House on Sahara, I wasn't entirely optimistic that they could be as good in the dirty shit palace/rashfest that is the IP.  
Came here w/ a party of 10 after 12am...it was dead.  Which was good since there was no wait.  A friendly jersey shore looking dude was the ""host"" in a white tee & dooky chain and greeted us with a ""how many mang?"" 
Service wasn't bad.  Food came out decently quick.  Just be aware that the late night menu is in effect and you can't get the chicken n waffles and other good stuff.  Had the Chicken Benedict, which was basically a pile of eggs on top of fried chicken on top of bacon on top of a biscuit on top of potatoes covered in some cheese and sauce.  Pretty damn good.
Portion sizes are still huge no matter what you get, whether it's the hashes or the 1lb burgers, so it'll soak up the juice and then u can go party some more and chuck it up later.
I'll come back again since it's on the strip and I want to try some other stuff from the regular menu during normal hours."
4746,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This hipster farm-fresh breakfast restaurant is located inside the LINQ hotel and wow, they know how to make a first-class breakfast. It's very popular and our wait time was about 25 minutes to be seated.

I ordered the Tractor Driver Combo which was a pancake with two eggs (scrambled for me) and protein (bacon!). I upgraded my pancake to a Hash House speciality - a blueberry pancake. This pancake was larger than the plate it was served on and was jam-packed with berries. It was so enormous I just couldn't finish it even though I was famished when it arrived.

Everything, including my freshly squeezed orange juice was absolutely superb. Prices were reasonable too! I would have easily given five stars if our service didn't suck. She was super-friendly-smiley but it was like pulling teeth to get a glass of water or a coffee refill or an extra napkin...frustrating!"
4747,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We loved the Hash House! My husband got the chicken and waffles and I got one of those big ol' pancakes. The chicken was fantastic with a pervasive, but not overpowering, taste of sage. I got one of the brown sugar banana pancakes and it was at least 6x bigger than the ones I make at home. It was SOOO GOOD. I wasn't able to finish it at the restaurant, so we took it back to our room and saved it for a snack later in the day. It was just as good then ;) Definitely recommend."
4748,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Sometimes changing ""standard""  food items goes too far, and I feel that Hash House A Go Go indeed tries too hard to change standard dishes. I also am suspicious of places  that serve such large portions that you must overeat or take home.  I do not confuse large portions with great food but here the portions are  large but the food only OK. 

If you are looking for large portions of  strange new combinations of food; this is the place for you."
4749,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Was in Vegas for EDC weekend && had to try Hash House! The food pictures looks bomb, so I had to give this place a chance. Ordered the Chicken & Waffles. The waffles had bacon in it!! Chicken & Bacon, my two favorite things. The pictures didn't lie, Lol. Def worth another visit."
4750,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Only been here once, but I still remember that big O pancake I had lol. Not a big fan of chicken and waffles, but I keep hearing theyre great here."
4751,Hash House A Go Go,1,I had the chicken and waffles here and all I can say is I won't be going back IHOP has better Chicken and waffles and there thing is pancakes.Just Sage on chicken is not a good recipe.
4752,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is my favorite place to go to in Las Vegas!!! The servings here are pretty amazing for the price!!!
4753,Hash House A Go Go,2,"If you're an instagramer, then this place is for you. If you're a FOODIE, then steer clear. The food is picturesque, but the taste is unimpressive. I got the sage fried chicken and it wasn't worth it. First of all, I came in at 1 am and the food came out in less than 10 minutes and it was not a busy night at all. That tells me that the food had already been cooked, and since it wasn't busy, the food had probably been sitting for some time. The biscuit was so hard that it actually took some effort to cut it with a knife and the fried chicken was drier than my humor, and this was no laughing matter. If you like taking pictures of your food then by all means, come here. But if you're into good tasting food, then this isn't it."
4754,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing food amazing portions. Definitely worth the long wait times. One of my all time favorite breakfast/brunch spots. Everytime in Vegas it's a must.
4755,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You'd better come hungry....  good grub,  crazy extra large proportions . 
Great service with a smile."
4756,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went Sunday at 9:30 am. A ton of people waiting...They call out of order to  accommodate people in party. It was a fair concept & time went fast. Portions are HUGE so share!! Had the known for chicken eggs Benedict. Was like a chicken fried steak over a baked mashed potato, scrambled eggs, biscuit and  a spicy chipotle cream sauce. Was good but got boring and dry. Biscuits were too big and dry. If I would have gotten chicken and waffles, may have been better and more moist. Kids got pancakes off the kids menu. One was still so big, my 3 Boys could have shared. Other son got a waffle that was also moist & good. Presentation and service was awesome!!!
We will go back and wait for a table again. It's worth it!!"
4757,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I wouldn't consider this place a 4* restaurant! No special flavors, dry chicken and waffles . Fries and Mac n Cheese was good 
Nice people tho but food isn't great but it's not bad either."
4758,Hash House A Go Go,4,Love how this place is open 24/7! My husband and I had stop by here last night or I shall say this morning around 1AM. I had ordered the basic because I really wanted sunny side up and everything came out perfectly. The portion was humungous I couldn't finish it. Their homemade biscuits was out of this world along with their homemade yam. My husband got the steak and eggs and the steak was cooked to his liking. Soooo good! We also love our waiter which I remember his name but he was very good and he taught us how to make Heinz 57 sauce out of A1 and ketchup lol
4759,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We decided to try this place based  on the reviews , it was ok food was very bland , Ridiculous proportions , nice presentation but just not seasoned well at all!! My pancake was the size of a frisbee, not buttery at all!! The turkey in the skillet left little to be desired , Two nice sized  chicken Breast on the waffles , bland but crispy, the waffles were huge and flavorless, overall food choices that we shared we just ok!! Wouldn't rush to go back ..."
4760,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Gargantuan Burgers... is all I have to say. 

My group was staying at the imperial palace and instead of walking to a different hotel for lunch, we decided to give the hash house a try. Honestly, saying that the portions are large doesn't quite describe how big their portions are. We're talking total eclipse here. I highly recommend splitting a plate with someone or having someone order the least expensive item on the menu (a biscuit) to avoid the split plate charge. It doesn't get anymore american than this... size wise"
4761,Hash House A Go Go,4,This is a good spot to satisfy your late night cravings. The BLT bloody mary is unique and awesome. It's like a sandwich in your alcohol. It even comes complete with toast and a mayo packet. Makes for an excellent snack while you wait for your meal. The menu is plentiful with lots of tasty-sounding options. But my favorite is the sage chicken. And I normally don't care much for chicken. It's delicious and yummy. Tip: Portions here are HUGE. Like really huge. So don't be afraid to share.
4762,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I'd like to give it a 3, but it's just that much of a disappointment. Let me back up:
6 years ago I was in Vegas and a local friend took me to this super hip place off the strip.  Back then they just had the one restaurant in Vegas and were, relative to today, very small. The food was amazing and so was the service.
Cut to present day: In town with my wife and I see there are more restaurants than the original.  We head to the one on the strip. Immediately, the ambience had that ""commercialized and branded"" feel.  When we sat down, our waitress was nice, yet overtaxed. Literally, 10 seconds after our order was given, someone showed up with food, obviously mistaken, and stormed off when we noted we had just ordered. A few minutes later, another person showed up with the wrong food.
Our food arrived. It wasn't horrible. In fact I liked it. However, I couldn't help but compare it to what it once was. In that comparison, the food was horrible.
I would have made this a 3 at least but that afternoon, the stomach issues started and really still haven't ""cleared"" up/out completely a day later.
I was happy with our waitress and tipped 30%. She did a great job for the over taxed situation she was in.
As for Hash House A go go (TM), it has fallen prey to the gluttonous greed of corporate America and is NOT what it once was."
4763,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went just for dessert--bread pudding and coffee.  Everything served here is typically so huge you cannot finish it.  My husband and I easily polished off the chocolate Snickers bread pudding though.  Don't get me wrong, it was big but two people can easily finish it if you like bread pudding.

This was one of the best bread puddings I have ever tried (best is still at Famous Dave's).  Each bite was different.  I never knew if the bite would taste more like bread, like chocolate or like a Snickers bar.  I really enjoyed that aspect.  It was also served with a very generous scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It was just the right amount to have some with each bite of pudding.  The only thing I wish they would do different would be to use hot fudge drizzle on the plate instead of cold chocolate syrup.

I also had a cup of coffee and I thought it was very good.  I tend to be a picky coffee drinker and thought their brew was very rich and super hot (double bonus for me).

Will definitely return for dessert.  We also can't wait to try the dinner menu.  The mashed potatoes look outstanding with what looked like broiled cheese and bacon on top.  We almost enjoyed watching the food pass by as much as we enjoyed our dessert.  The meals are gigantic and the presentation is unique.

Have been for breakfast and dessert and can't wait to go again."
4764,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for breakfast one morning during a recent business trip.  Located in the Quad, it is a perfect location if you are staying at any of the center Strip resorts.  Seated at the bar with my friend, the bartender was attentive and very nice.  I ordered the Basic breakfast, which included scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, fruit, and a biscuit.  My friend ordered the bacon waffles.  We were both very pleased with our selections.  Hash House is traditionally known for their abundant portions, but in my case the Basic breakfast was just right.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon was no too crisp, and the potatoes were crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  Best of all was the biscuit and fresh mashed strawberries.  Delicious!"
4765,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Went for lunch, restaurant was fairly busy, sat at bar. Ordered the chicken and waffles, which took almost 30 minutes to arrive... fried chicken was barely warm. Very disappointing. The manager offered to make another one, but I declined. Food was not worth the wait. I've found this restaurant very inconsistent with quality of food leaving their kitchen, over my past several visits."
4766,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place rocks.  I love the chicken and waffles here.  Make sure you go there hungry, you get a ton of food"
4767,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food: good! Chicken and waffles and potatoes. Great portions and decent prices. 

Service: good for as busy as they are. 

Atmosphere: looks good but it is soooooo busy all the time and the wait sucks!!!

We love this place but you have to be patient. Expect a 45 minute wait."
4768,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The BEST homestyle breakfast I have ever eaten. Service is amazing, but a long wait is a given. We only waited about 35 minutes on a Friday morning for breakfast & the waitress said it was a slow day given that their usual breakfast wait time approaches an hour & a half. Soooo, if you are on a time constraint, move along! Nonetheless, our waitress (Kendra?) was phenomenal, funny, and gave great suggestions. I will start by saying I am not a pancake guy, but I knew from recommendations that I had to get pancakes at Hash House, so I did. I got the Tractor (something) breakfast with brown sugar banana pancakes, and let me say it was the best thing I have eaten! So sweet & perfect, I did not use any of the syrup. Came with your style of eggs and choice of potatoes or meat, I got over easy eggs (they were done perfectly), and a slab of ham. My parents got the crab cake benedict, and the tractor dish also with the banana pecan french toast. Everything was amazing and we were actually in and out quite quickly after the wait. Will be back, love this place!"
4769,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ok folks, I know this restaurant is good only based on 1 item lol Ive been here 3 times and ordered the Fried Chix Eggs Benny everytime. Biscuits, cheese, bacon, tomatoes, spinach, chipotle sauce and succulent moist fried chicken. The most twisted, delicious and savory dish for breakfast ever! With a superior quality that doesnt go down I had the same dish 3 times and was wanting more with a full stomach haha Ill be back in Vegas again soon just to try the Pancakes, French toast and all the other delicious items! I want the whole menu haha"
4770,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Everytime I go to vegas, I come here at least once or twice. This place has been a staple for my yearly trip to Defcon for at least 5 years. It is located on the strip in the LINQ casino, right smack dab in the middle of the casino. At one time the casino was called the imperial palace which was a lot more weathered than the casino it is now. But I liked it because it is centrally located sitting in between classic Flamingo and Harrah's Casinos. 

Now for the food, making your way up the escalator you will start smelling that made to order food that comes out of that place. Hash House a Go Go is one of the best restaurants I have been to ever and I have 5 years of experience to base that off of. Even after a casino re-branding they have managed to keep the food to the top quality i have come to expect. 

When you eat here, expect to leave VERY full, although the menu prices are modest with $15-20 meals, the portions are quite healthy. So if you had breakfast you may want to share. Before I start talking about the many dishes I enjoy here, I wanted to take a moment to tell you about the coffee. They have a serious cafe in this place, if you have a traditional espresso look no further. And for you adventurous types, try the Smores Mocha, its huge and has a layer of marshmallow over it! If cinnamon is more your flavor when I had the Cinnamon Capp, I was in heaven. Not a coffee drinker? Well how about a nice tall BLT Bloody Mary, they put bacon and lettuce in this thing and serve you a side of toast. That's right you can take them out and you have yourself a drink... and a BLT!

Now for the food.

I am going to start off with my favorite dish and most likely this will be yours too, Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. For less than $20 you can have a feast of perfectly fried chicken towered (and I mean literally, towered) over huge Belgian waffles filled with bacon. I can never finish this meal so it end up breakfast the next day. This meal comes in a tower with a steak knife and skewer to hold it up. The plate is beautifully decorated (must like all their plates) with peppers and sauces. The presentation is always there with Hash House, I wonder what type of dish washer they have because it gets put to use! 

The other meal I have here is the 18oz Rib-eye which is bone-in and sitting on a mound of pumpkin mashed potatoes, I didnt know what that was until I got this. I still really dont know what it is but it tastes delicious! This meal is a must for the Steak eaters out there. 

The venue as I mentioned before is up an escalators in the middle of the LINQ casino. It is open 24/7 but gets really busy during regular meal times. I would suggest coming in the off hours. Also there is no bathroom upstairs so, be sure to go before you head there or you will be walking around the casino trying to find one."
4771,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place gets 3.5 stars from me, but I rate it as a 4 since you can't give half star ratings.  This place is located inside the Quad (Formerly Imperial Palace).  I went here with my wife last Saturday for brunch.  The main reason I would give this place 3.5 stars is definitely not because of the food, but because of the atmosphere.  First off, it's located inside the Quad hotel, which in general is dumpy and has a high population of riffraff.  When we went, the place was very busy (Minimum 30 minute wait for 2 people) and loud.  They don't have a lot of seating, so we ended up just standing and waiting.  I'm not sure if it's because of where it's located in the hotel, but we got no cell phone service in this restaurant.  Again, because it's so loud in here, it's not exactly the best place to hold a conversation.  That said, if loud music and good people watching is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this place.  The food here was actually very good, and they give you way too much of it.  My wife ordered the sage chicken and waffles with bacon, while I simply had a bacon sandwich with fries.  Both were good.  I really wasn't in the mood for breakfast food that day, so my options were limited.  Also, it seemed like we had to wait for a long time to get our food, mostly because they were busy.  Overall, I wouldn't rush back here to eat, mainly because of the atmosphere, but the food was good."
4772,Hash House A Go Go,3,Was looking forward to eating here.  Food was okay but not great enough for me to return.  Portions are huge ...share a dish.  Fun place to try
4773,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is pretty unusual and somewhat difficult to find using their own map on Yelp.  

I was with two other guys for a convention and we thought we'd try this out at 11PM.  Service was good.  The food offerings were very good and breakfast appears to served all day.  

I ordered the corned beef hash...it wasn't.  It was corned beef on top of chopped and fried potatos, a load of cheese and a rock hard biscuit.  It was tasty but no hash in the corned beef hash.  

The overall experience was good or I would have to post a two star review.  I would love for someone in the restaruanting world to start with a menu of realistic portion-size expectations.  The portions were enormous and you have no idea you are getting so much food."
4774,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food... I'd recommend it to anybody. Just be prepared for the wait to be seated it was packed
4775,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Portions are huge, you can split a meal.

Line is always out the door, be prepared to wait an hour in line and another 30 minutes for your food.

After 1.5 hours of waiting, we weren't too impressed with the food. I was expecting a flavor explosion, but it was just ""bleh"". Even the bloody mary was gross..."
4776,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So let me start by saying that, my friend suggested we go here in fact she raved about it prior to our arrival at the Quad (where we were staying anyway). On the afternoon that we ventured upstairs we were beyond hung over and quite ready for a meal of epic proportion BOY DID  WE FIND IT!! To begin our server sucked, I believe her name was Shea, but don't quote me but if you get her avoid her ass like the plague. She took 15 minutes to get our drink orders  (one Pepsi and two waters)to the table after telling her we needed a minute to look over the menu.When she finally brought the drinks and I discovered my water glass was dirty I proceeded to wait another 20 minutes to get my water again. The kicker...they weren't busy and she tended to just disappear for 20 minute increments. Another waitress that we called over (Janine) was SO helpful! Despite us requesting the manager she still was polite and attempted to help us with anything we needed even though we were not at her table. Once the manager arrived and we explained our issue he took over and took care of us for the whole rest of the time. I ordered the rib eye with horseradish potatoes and boy was it good! The manager made sure that EVERYTHING was taken care of and was so freaking attentive to our needs. He even brought us a huge piece of their wonderful strawberry cheesecake and ice cream for our troubles. We tipped (Janine) stiffed that other chick...and consistently thanked the manager!! I will definitely go here every time I'm in Vegas and want a great meal and great service...Love it!"
4777,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I've been going to a different Hash House for years, so I figured it was time to give this location a try. We arrived about 7am (seems like a reasonable breakfast time). We were second group in line and we were told it would be a ten minute wait. They were obviously understaffed as 90% of the tables were open. 

After waiting ten unnecessary minutes we were seated. It took close to 5 more minutes before someone came to get our drink order. Once we placed our order in our server disappeared. Our coffee cups ran dry. It was a good 10 minutes before she came back. The hostess jammed the small front room full, which gave the illusion of a packed house to people in the lobby. It was excessively noisy. The larger back room remained vacant while the lobby was packed. 

The food was okay. The burgers were a little overdone (yes I like burgers for breakfast). The pancake was dry and didn't come with enough syrup to correct that issue. 

The poor service and inadequate food don't give me much of reason to wait on the uncomfortable steel benches in the lobby again."
4778,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Where do I begin? We went for brunch on a Sunday. The wait was about 45 mins long but it was well worth the wait! Our waitress immediately greeted us and took our orders for drinks. The drinks and food was just outstanding. Make sure you have an appetite because the entrees are pretty hefty! The Chicken and Waffles are a huge hit and I only managed to eat half of it, if that!"
4779,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food and Service. Call for reservations.  It gets crowded and crazy during peek hours.  Is totally worth it when you get the food though.  Fried Chicken in any of the dishes is worth it.  Great portions sharing is a good idea.
4780,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We all know there are the best buffets in Las Vegas, but if you are looking for large quantities of excellent unique cuisine; then you must search out Hash House!

Located right off the strip, it's easy access from all the action and attractions. There might be a bit of a wait to be seated, but if your smart, go check out the bar where its first come first serve. Not only do you get to see all the specialty drinks being made but you also see all the beautifully plated dishes come out of the kitchen. You honestly don't even have to look at the menu to choose your entire meal.

If you decide to sit at the bar, hopefully you get Gary and Sassy. Two knowledgeable mixologists who make visually stunning drinks. They might even make you an awesome drink that won't be found on the menu. Gary gave us a truly memorable experience and we will undoubtedly return.

Whether you get the Fried Chicken Benedict or Pancakes the size of hubcaps, you can't go wrong at Hash House. The prices are extremely reasonable to boot. This is a must go, you will not be disappointed!!"
4781,Hash House A Go Go,1,The portion sizes are too large and the taste was subpar at best. The dish were not well balanced making it hard to eat. The waititme for brunch however was only 10 minutes so there is a plus.
4782,Hash House A Go Go,4,Went here with a huge group of families.  Service was pretty good but they kinda hustled us for these tractor drink cups for the kids.  The kids asked for them and the server told the kids they were 4 bucks but didn't tell us parents.  That was kind of annoying.  Other than that I could not complain.  Yum!  Definitely go hungry.
4783,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Heard this was a really good place for a heavy big plated breakfast or as one of my friend said ""Denny's on steroid"" and usually there's a 3 hour wait because it is always packed. Well I was already starving but since I wanted to try this place I decided to try it. Luckily when we got there, there was no wait....and we got seated right away...and this was a Saturday around lunch time. We all decided to kind of share since the portions were so big...so I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict which was featured on Man vs. Food as a favorite food of this restaurant. 

mMmMmM it was delicious indeed! The sauce was amazing and the combination of fried chicken, egg, biscuit covered in an amazing gravy sauce was sensational and I probably could have finished the whole thing myself if I wasn't watching out for carb intake....however I totally wiped clean my half of the plate. hehe 

Definitely a good place for very hungry people and for those that love a heavy amazingly delicious breakfast meal."
4784,Hash House A Go Go,5,"For a better dining experience, this is the place. We went for breakfast and Corrin, our server, was great. Hubby got red velvet waffles, and I picked vanillas both delicious. We both only ate half of each of our waffles. Sausage was quality and not that soft mushy cheap sausage, friend chicken was delicious, but the breast and leg they serve is a bit small. The presentation matches the yummy taste for the most part. My son ordered his usual of the kids' menu (from every restaurant) the mac and cheese, but it was in a pool of cheese- way too much for us and we love cheesey food. Corrin quickly replaced it with his 2nd choice, grilled cheese on perfectly toasted wheat bread with fries, but again way too much cheese. So he wasted it :-( I'd have him order something that doesn't come with cheese next time. They seem to over due it in that area. I also enjoyed the hot chocolate. It is one of the better ones out there. They do not offer gluten free items so my daughter ate tomatoes and sausage. She enjoyed it."
4785,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So the Inferior Palace is now the Quad. Thankfully, Hash House is still upstairs. While the Linq construction out front makes getting into the Quad a chore, the good news is you're no longer dodging taxis to come in here, nor is it as difficult to find the escalators to Hash House anymore.

Don't miss the flapjacks (apple cinnamon is my fave, followed by blueberry pecan) and the chicken & waffles is to die for. (tip: order that for at least two) Even a bowl of oatmeal comes out super sized with a large selection of fresh fruit.

They are open for lunch and dinner (but not late; I think they close at 11) but breakfast is where they really shine. Eat here."
4786,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We made it there early on a Wednesday and had a 5 minute wait. The service was prompt. My one complaint is that they had no regular drip coffee. I got the giant pancake and could only eat half, so bring an appetite. It was really delicious with bananas and brown sugar"
4787,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is my go-to for breakfast in Vegas. Their pork tenderloin eggs Benedict will get you right past the hangover and right into the Bloody Maries. Awesome food, huge portions and great service!! Love it"
4788,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We visited for brunch on a Tuesday morning around 10:30. There was a 25-minute wait for a table. This wasn't unexpected as we had read the reviews and knew how popular this on-strip joint was. Friends told us after the fact that the off-strip original location is nowhere nearly as crowded and is actually much better. Maybe next time we're visiting Vegas we'll check it out.

Both hubby and I considered ordering the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict or the Fried Chicken and Waffles but changed our minds after seeing the portion sizes. No, they weren't paltry portions, but just the opposite, incredibly jumbo. We saw some table around us order them and split each one between two people. That's definitely the way to go. We each ended up ordering the Sage Fried Chicken which came with 2 eggs, as well as bacon mashed potatoes and fresh fruit. The portions were so big that we both had breakfast for the next day as well. Lastly, there was an impressive cocktail list and I enjoyed a pineapple mimosa."
4789,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I wish there was a Hash House in CA because it was so good! My group ordered mostly the corned beef hash and the meatloaf hash. I think I was in heaven when I started eating it. The portions were great too. All of us had food leftover to take home. Each hash entree also comes with fruits and a biscuit, which I didn't even get to because I was so full from the actual entree. You must go here and eat if you are on the strip! I guess the one bad thing is that the wait for the food was really long but it was so worth it!"
4790,Hash House A Go Go,4,If you are hungry and in the mood for a big breakfast then this is the place to be. Consider sharing plates- it's that big. The chicken and waffles are the house favorite but the chicken is r as flavorful as i would have liked.  The waffle is light and fluffy and will leave you wanting more.  My favorite is the waffle with bacon strips cooked in- everything is good with bacon!!
4791,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Huge portions, I advise you to share unless you love to go to town when you eat.. HORRIBLE SERVICE after we ordered our food we never saw our waiter again.. Even when I would see him and try to get his attention he would look and walk right by hhahah.. This place is overrated in my opinion as far as the food/quality go!"
4792,Hash House A Go Go,2,Food was just OK. Service was bad. Food took a long time to come out .  It was one plate at a time. One plate every ten minutes. There was five of us eating and by the time the last meal came out everyone else was done eating.
4793,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Every time I go to Vegas, I always want to stop by in this restaurant to eat and to take a break from all the gambling.  It's always busy in here but it is always worth the wait!!

After waiting for about 30 to 40 minutes, we were seated and then we were greeted promptly by out server.  She was really nice and she was patient with us since she probably could tell we were a little hung over from the night before.  She recommended the bloody mary to help!!  Cool points to her for that.  

I recommend trying their hash dishes.  You won't be disappointed.  I actually love the corned beef hash.  Remember, the portions are big and you probably won't be able to finish all of it.  Another dish I tried before is the sage chicken and waffles.  That was also another huge plate and the chicken was cooked perfect over a great tasting waffle.  

They also make great drinks!!  If you're not yet drunk from drinking while you're gambling, try the drinks they make here.  If you're hung over still try the drinks here.  You know the saying, the only way to cure a hangover is to drink more.  

Great restaurant.  Great prices.  Great atmosphere!"
4794,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Meh.  I think this place is a little overrated.  I looked this place up on Yelp and  came here solo since my bf was playing poker.  I don't mind eating by myself.  This place is located in the Quad and you had to take an escalator there.  I waited in this line right outside the door for a good 2 minutes before somebody told me that this was the line for the bar.  The people in front of me and behind me thought they were waiting to put their name down too!  The hostess stand is actually further and right in front of the restaurant, not at the doors entering the restaurant.  Lame.

So it was super fast putting my name down, but I told them once a seat opened up at the bar I'd probably sit there.  He told me it'd be a 40 minute wait on a Saturday at10AM.I looked around and people seemed to be ordering the chicken and waffles but that seemed like too big of a meal for me.  It took me around 30ish minutes for a seat to open up at the bar.  Then like 4 freaking seats opened up after me and nobody sat down (ugh).  I wanted waffles though so I ordered the combo which came with pancakes but you could upgrade to a waffle for a buck.  I also ordered a bloody mary.  So after I order they come out with chicken and waffles!  They messed up on my one order so that super sucked.  The bartender admitted it and asked if I wanted another bloody mary and it'd be on her since they messed up but I declined since I'd be too blasted walking back to my hotel.  The bloody mary was really good but the food was just like.... not good.  The waffle looked nice and big and fluffy but it was lukewarm and soggy.  The eggs were eggs and the bacon was a little chewy.  I think restaurants like this should at least have basics down!  For the wait and the food I wouldn't come back here again."
4795,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It's fried chicken, bacon, biscuits, tomato, mashed potatoes and spinach with a chipotle Benedict sauce. I'm not kidding when I say it's enough for at least 3 people. But it is so good!! Very flavorful and the chipotle Benedict sauce is creamy with a hint of spice. It was also the dish featured on Man v. Food!"
4796,Hash House A Go Go,4,My husband and I came here for breakfast to this location after trying to decide what we wanted to eat. We had ate at one of their other locations off the strip last year and were already prepared for the portions sizes. We opt to split one of their breakfast meals and were not disappointed. There is a small surcharge for plate sharing but at this place it is is well worth it. The banana brown sugar flapjack tasted very good and had chunks of bananas throughout. It reminded me banana nut crunch cereal. Make sure you have plently of time to waste. The service was very slow and took awhile to get refills on my coffee and water.
4797,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had absolutly awesom fried green tomatoe with chicken salad and grilled chicken with pumpkin and mashed potatoes, coverd with tomatoes. Food was amazing and we will come back for sure. Loved it."
4798,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG!! Best kept secret.
Let start with the environment. Lots of pictures and art work on wall. The food was so good we ate here twice while in Vegas the only thing I did not like is that it's so so called.
This is a 24/7 location breakfast,Lunch, Dinner options and all the food is a very large portion you can share your food unless you have a very very big appetite.
The prices was reasonable and staff friendly.
In a good location it's in one of the hotels."
4799,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food here has beautiful presentation, but nearly no taste. The portions are huge - we got the famous chicken Benedict and the biscuits and gravy. Both were served on a giant bed of tasteless mashed red potatoes and the biscuits and gravy had barely enough gravy to make a thin layer over the biscuits. 

The service was terrible, the waits were long...save yourself the time and money and go someplace else.  Or try a pancake. Maybe they are better?"
4800,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Overrated. The portions maybe generous, but that doesn't give an excuse for having bland food. The food here is lost in all the layers of meat, veggies, sauces, and decorations. I think if the dishes were made more simple then I think it would have been fine. 

To be honest, classic and simple dishes like eggs Benedict or fried chicken & waffles were lost in the clutter of food put onto this one plate. Now, don't get me wrong, the food here is decent but in terms of flavor, it was lacking.

I tried the Andy Sage's Fried Chicken Benedict which is like a unconventional version of biscuit and gravy mixed with eggs Benedict. The portion is huge and reads to be a delicious dish on the menu, but in actuality, there's nothing spectacular about it. Like previously mentioned, a lot going on. The chicken was a little bland but at least it was moist, the hollandaise sauce was too thick and bland, the biscuits were fine, and the mashed potatoes were average. I'd rate this dish 3/5. 

The take on chicken & waffles here was close, but no cigar. I thought the waffle was good (although a bit heavy) and I especially enjoyed the thick bacon that was cooked into the waffle -- a great combination of sweet and savory. As for the fried chicken, it was appetizing, but not lacking in bold flavors that a fried chicken should have. I'd rate this one 3.5/5. 

Located inside Imperial Palace on the Strip, it's a place you got to try for yourself if you're in Vegas. Although it's not the best food you'll find, it's worth the try. Like they all say, ""Go big or go home""."
4801,Hash House A Go Go,3,Portions so large but we didn't want to look like cheap tourists so ordered a plate an entree for every single person in the party. Next time I will definitely be cheap.
4802,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ordered Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese and the sage fried chicken.  Huge serving!!! It's best to share it with a group."
4803,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions, awesome food presentation, great tasting chicken, good service and pleasant dining decor. I highly recommend Hash when you want a killer breakfast and now it's even easier to get to with a location right on the strip, inside the Linq.

They are usually really busy so try to avoid large parties and expect a wait, especially around breakfast and lunch time."
4804,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The food's visually stunning and beautiful; however, once you get down to eating its quite bland. In a strange way I felt swindled.

My initial rating was a ""1"" star; however, the very reasonable prices and large portions forced me to make an adjustment."
4805,Hash House A Go Go,3,"While I am a HUGE fan of the original San Diego's Hash House A Go Go, and waited almost 2 hours to be seated, this place was totally different.

First of all, the imperial palace is soooo outdated. The parking structure to the casino was a trip all on its own, and once we got to the casino, while we kept seeing the hash house a go go signs, we couldn't find it.

Alas, we asked the security guard who told us to go to the middle of the casino (I hate these half ass directions btw) and walk up the escalators. While I may have looked at him little crazy, indeed you have to find the center of the casino, and you'll find the escalators to the restaurant.

Unlike the San Diego's earth friendly, clean, crowded atmosphere, this one was much like the Imperial palace. Smoky and empty.

don't get me wrong. the service was great. Though I wish the guy would stop winking, and if he has a twitch, my bad playa... my bad.

I got the pork katsu with the burger buns and my co workers got different plates. Of course none of us were ever able to finish our plate, and it was delicious.  I just wish that Hash House A Go Go would've thought twice about their locations in vegas."
4806,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was amazing. Service was not the best, but the food was worth the awful service. Serving sizes are huge!"
4807,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent choice for a fun breakfast! A load of food and reasonably priced! Great choice when staying in Vegas.
4808,Hash House A Go Go,5,"legit food! breakfast was insanely good!

Got a skillet, wife got monster sized waffles. 
Good coffee too!"
4809,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for breakfast at the suggestion of a local.  He said that the food was delicious and that the portions were huge.  He was right on both accounts!  My husband and I ordered a Belgian Waffle and I ordered a Blackberry Granola Pancake.  We both barely ate half of it.  Our server, Ishii, started out unpleasant but improved throughout the meal.  The food although awesome, was expensive and we were charged for each cup of coffee.  There were no refills.  We are glad we gave it a try and MIGHT consider returning for dinner.  One thing is for sure, we will DEFINITELY split an entree!"
4810,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hubby and I took my grandparents to this place for brunch and it was absolutely yummy! HUGE portions (my husband and I each ordered something, and ate some then and it was dinner) of great food. The waitress was very fun too. She was able to handle my grandpa and his overwhelming humorous sarcasm. Will repeat next time we are in Henderson!"
4811,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hash House A No Go!
-'s: Hype. Poor service. Noise. 
+'s: Extremely large portions  

To put review in context, I was a server for over 11 years, my mother had a catering company, and we were not ""doing the Vegas thing"" meaning we were neither hung over nor drinking prior to the drinks ordered in this post.

I've wanted to visit this place since I saw the Man vs. Food episode many years ago. So disappointing. It is incredibly noisy and crowded. My husband used his earplugs to handle the din. We had a 45 minute wait. We stood at the bar for a Bloody Mary to pass the time, waited 10 minutes before borrowing the menu from the folks next to us, and were noticed 15 minutes later, went with the bartender suggested upgrade on the vodka for $2 more for a total tab of $26. Rough start, but still hopeful. 

Upon sitting, I noticed place setting had a dirty spoon that I ignored, knowing that sometimes dishwashers miss things. After about 10 minutes, our server took our order...Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict, OJ, coffee, side of ""bacon, bacon, bacon"" and another Bloody Mary. Drinks took a while; I had to ask three times to two different servers for milk for my coffee. Bacon ordered as an appetizer came with the entree, which is probably on us for not stressing that we wanted it earlier. We had to ask two different staff again for side plates so that we could share the dish. Although the presentation was photo worthy in terms of sheer size, our food was barely lukewarm. The tomato slices were a faint red; there were a few sprinkled raw spinach leaves, the equivalent of a single scrambled egg, and a large, but dry chicken breast. The mashed potatoes under the tower of calories were roughly mashed with large chunks of potatoes and very little seasoning. On the bright side, the portion was huge and easily split by two. 

And here's the rub... the server brought back a boxed glass like the one the third Bloody Mary was served in; I stopped him and said that we hadn't ordered the glass, and he explained that it came with the drink. (Although the very same drinks at the bar did not come with a glass.) Looked at the bill and found that the upgrade in vodka this time raised the drink price to $21.99. I wanted to dispute the charge, but the husband was done and really didn't want to wait around for the server any longer. I felt that the ""upsell"" was dishonest and very much a swindle.

Be careful when ordering drinks and double check what you are charged. The servers, runners, bussers, etc were all pleasant enough...they were just unable to handle the volume and activity the day we were there. But we will not be going back to see if this was a fluke."
4812,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Second time I came here & once again, it left me super duper happy! I always go for their Benedicts because that's my absolute favorite breakfast especially from here. This place is a MUST! Yal gotta try it out if ever you're in the area & are in dire need of some post-drunkened recovery."
4813,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We have been to a Hash House in another location and loved it so since we were here at the Quad we wanted to eat!! Lots of people waiting to get in but it went pretty fast 15 min. They took us to a booth/chair table. I sat on the booth and went to the floor!! MY HEAD WAS AT THE TABLE!! I sat on the chair and my husband sat on the booth with a throw pillow under him so he would be comfy. The lady who sat us didn't even try to help us with this. The waiter came and took our drink order and was friendly. As we waited my husband noticed his silverware was dirty so we got a fresh set. 
  My husband ordered Cornbeef Hash with eggs and potatos and a beer, I got salad with mango vinrigrette and sage chicken. The waiter came to us and said sorry our food is taking long but, he didn't like the looks of my salad it was all wilted so he sent it back. Yikes!! That was nice of him. Now everyone around us is eating but, us because of my salad. 
  We got our food and my husband loved his Cornbeef. My salad there were issues. DRY!!! We had to ask for more vinergrette, which took him a while and then he never came back and asked us how we were doing or even feel up our drinks!!! In which I was waiting for my ice to melt to drink something half way through eating. I had still old and wilted lettuce it was awful. 
  We will never go back to this location again!!!"
4814,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food was great! Took about an hour to get a table during Sunday brunch but you can buy a drink at the host stand. Brilliant. The chicken and waffles were ridiculous, tasted great and is enough food for 3 people. I hope to come back again one day."
4815,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best Bloody Mary EVER - The BLT Mary!!! Pretty sure they hand-picked the freshest, juiciest tomatoes and somehow married them with bacon flavor to come out with this spicy/savory mix. A salt/bacon crumble rimmer and a large piece of (what else?) BACON as a garnish and TA-DA!!! Best Bloody Mary. Ever. The End."
4816,Hash House A Go Go,2,"First of all, like everyone else, I've wanted to try this place. I've heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. 

I arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), ""We don't seat parties if they aren't all here, but you can check if they're in there."" Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. 

First of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer's platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there's a difference between good and thinking something's good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. 

Second, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I've had better service when Binion's Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. 

Third, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you're practically sitting on their neighbor's lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don't get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. 

Fourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she ""LOST"" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would've picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I'm not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn't be that rude to anyone! 

I give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it's worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We'll see...

So Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to  pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn't  running around forgetting people's orders, losing people's credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer's platters can pay a waiter's 4 hour shift and they'd provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!"
4817,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Really good food, huge portions,  reasonable prices. I highly recommend you c ok me to this place"
4818,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ok, listen. Was there 67 billion people in line to eat here on a Sunday around noon? Yes. So...go early. 

I've never been here but heard about their epic portion sizes, so I sort of knew what to expect going in. 

I ended up getting the bacon/avocado scramble and a bloody mary. The scramble was really tasty and they didn't skimp on the avocado. It came with a huge biscuit, home fries, and peach jam. The peach jam on the biscuit was HECKIN PHENOM. So I ate maybe about...2/3 of my meal, we finished around noon and I kid you not - I wasn't hungry until like 8pm. So it's perfect fuel for walking around the strip all day. 

They are true to Vegas pricing so don't expect Denny's $$. But after a long night of drinking, this is probably not what the doctor would order but it feels good anyways."
4819,Hash House A Go Go,3,"There was no wait but we did go in at 11pm. We owed the Sage Chicken and Waffles to share and we still didn't finish it as it was enormous as other yelpes have stated regarding their portion size. In sure it could have easily fed 2 adults and 2 small children or 3 adults and still be filling.  The price was decent concidering the actual size of the meal but that's pretty much all your paying for as the services was just okay. The presentation of the meal was great and almost floored me when it came out because of how much food was on the plate. The chicken was good if you like A LOT of batter. I felt it needed a little something for me to make it stand out a bit more but all in all not bad.  The four heavy waffles included in the meal had bacon slices cooked in it which was nice but really if I didn't see it while eating it, I wouldn't have even noticed it was there since the waffle itself over powered it in flavor."
4820,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Had to make a visit here after seeing at least 100 infamous chicken and waffle pictures.  And of course, what else would I get here...chicken and waffles.  But don't be stupid like me and make the biggest two mistakes of my life:

1) drinking Fat Tuesdays before eating because I got full before the food even got to the table and also buzzed.  Plus the unhealthy amount of sugar in one of those is not very complementing to the oiliness of fried chicken.

2) ordering one chicken and waffles plate for yourself.  Everyone shared a plate with someone at the table except me and a friend who insisted we needed our own.  Once we got our plates we knew we were idiots.  There's so much chicken and waffle that I'm sure it could last three meals.

Regardless, the food was aesthetically pleasing.  The waffle was alright, nothing too special.  I think there was bacon in it which I'm personally not a fan of.  The chicken had maple syrup downed on it which I'm also not a fan of.  There's a fried leek too.  I just prefer my sweet foods to be sweet (why is there bacon in the waffle....) and my savory foods to be salty and deep fried.  I think the chicken would've been better if it wasn't drowning in syrup.  But the fried leek was good."
4821,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Long wait (holiday season), but worth it! Great bloody mary's, and lots of delicious brunch dishes to choose from. All the portion sizes seemed enormous. A note for hash enthusiasts: the hashes are with diced potatoes, instead of the traditional shredded or tiny cubes of potatoes."
4822,Hash House A Go Go,2,"What i believe people love about this place, which all Americans Love, is the large over the top portion size of the dishes. However, the taste of the food was just mediocre to me. I tried the apple cinnamon pancake which flavor wise was not that amazing. The eggs Benedict wasn't anything to boast about either. Only thing I truly enjoyed was the mashed potatoes included in the eggs Benedict which were well seasoned. I have to note that it took some time for my cousin to figure out where her fried egg was located on this dish as it appeared she was served less than a whole egg, odd because everything else is plentiful.

My personal dish was the fried sage salad. What i appreciated was that the salad included more than enough topping blue cheese, apples etc... but i wasn't impressed.

The staff here are sincerely nice but i wouldn't return for the food."
4823,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always amazing!!  It's our must do when in Vegas!!  Everything I've ever tried has been outstanding food wise!  The service is always great, we sat at the bar top and got to chat with a couple of bartenders on our last trip, they were super friendly!  You will not be disappointed!!  The portions are large, so if you're not super hungry, you can split a plate and have an extra drink. The bloody Mary's are outstanding!!"
4824,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Late night grub fail.  This location was just a disaster, super slow service, food was not flavorful to the point of almost not edible and a fail on the Bloody Mary which just tasted like tomato juice.  I actually had to add pepper and Tabasco to try to get some flavor.  Dont know if this chain is going down hill or if it was this location and time.  The last location I went to on Sahara was great!  This one I would of rather skipped it and got a bag of chips at the gift shop."
4825,Hash House A Go Go,2,huge plates of really cheap filling food.  If you're going for quantity you'll love it...if you care about the quality  go somewhere else
4826,Hash House A Go Go,5,Sage chicken and waffles are divine and feed 3-4 people. The waffles have bacon in them! Pancakes are gigantic! We take all of our out of town guests here... especially late at night!
4827,Hash House A Go Go,3,First time back in a while.  Atmosphere still good.  Started with Fried Green Tomatoes.   Tomatoes were flavorful.  Finished up with Chicken and Waffles.   Chicken was fried to perfection and very crisp.  Waffles were good too.  Took quiet a while for entrÃ©e to arrive.  We took home half the entrÃ©e as the portion sizes here are ginormous!!!
4828,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We got there early and didn't wait too long! Hostess was polite. Server/bar tender was wonderful, made a great BLT Mary! 

You need to understand going into this that the portions are enough for more than one person. Seriously, probably up to three. Share.

I had the Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict. Try it."
4829,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great place for a hungover brunch after a night out on the strip. Food is great and the portions are HUGE - don't order an appetiser like we did, you won't get through it all! Service was great too. Would recommend!"
4830,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is a go-to breakfast spot whenever my wife and I are in Vegas. The chicken and waffles is the best I've had (the little touches like the bacon in the waffles and fried leeks take it over the top), and the portions are ridiculous. We generally only order one meal and share at this point unless we are down for engorging ourselves."
4831,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Gluttony in its best form.  HUGE portions (even for Oklahoma standards, lol).... I mean I ate for 30 minutes and it looked like I hadn't touched it. It's definitely good, but I'm pretty sure I'll be sharing next time!  I had the chicken and waffles and the husband had a skillet of some sort.  Both were great!  Bloody Mary's are enormous and can be taken to-go! Win!"
4832,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg, the food here! Talk about delicious, ginormous dishes. My group tried the cinnamon apple pancakes and the chicken and waffles. The portions were huge, definitely come hungry! It was busy but the staff was super great and the atmosphere was great too. A must try for sure!"
4833,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First of all this place is located in the LINQ hotel, great location on the strip. When we walked in there were people everywhere, but I urged to stay because the food looked so great. Our wait was only about 45 minutes for 3 people. (If your hungry this may not be the ideal place for breakfast due to the wait, but luckily they are open 24/7) I got the sage chicken Benedict thing, the waiter said it was the best thing on the menu. My friends had a meatloaf hash, and pancake (which was huge) combo. Over all the vibe and food was great."
4834,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'm still not totally sure how I feel about this place. The portion sizes are definitely outrageous. No one should ever be able to finish their plate here. The food was all OK, but nothing really stood out besides the size of everything. I guess go here for the novelty, if you are super hungry and have 6 other people with you to share your plate."
4835,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The second star is strictly for the service, the food was terrible. The guy behind the bar was friendly and attentive. The food was terrible. Should I say it again? I had the chicken fried steak, the batter was way over the flavor of the steak. The green beans were hard and undercooked. I ate about a 1/8 of the meal, asked for a Togo box, so at least I could give to someone who maybe needed a meal. Won't eat here again."
4836,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A huge yummy portion of chicken and waffles came to our table! We also tried the french toast and it was also very good. This place was fun, but busy! Come with patience and you won't be disappointed."
4837,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Worth the long wait? Yes! Thankfully I had done my research ahead of time and knew to expect a long wait. We arrived around 10:00 am on a Saturday, and were told the wait would be around 40 minutes. Unfortunately it took an hour, but a delicious bloody mary helped that go faster! I am a bit of a bloody mary snob, and this was deliciously spicy! Plus, a healthy sized glass as well. 

We were seated and immediately greeted by a friendly server who took both our food & drink order. I suggest knowing what you want before sitting down. I ordered the chorizo hash thanks to the suggestion by our Uber driver, and my husband ordered the brown sugar & banana pancake. 

The portions are massive!! I loved mine, but after a while, my husband said his was a bit too sweet. But that's too be expected! The cold brew with vanilla was the best cold brew we have had! 

Overall, I'd come back and suggest it to friends. It was a wonderful experience, maybe just pack a snack to tide you over!"
4838,Hash House A Go Go,2,"NOT WORTH THE TWO HOUR WAIT ohmygosssHHHHHHh.

The wait was only bearing because it was near the strip but I was starvingggg. The pictures did me wrong. I ordered the corned beef hash because, hello hash, what else should I order from a hash house?

My hash was DRENCHED in the cheese, it was like 80% Cheese and the rest was the corned beef. It got really salty really quickly and I couldn't even finish it. I tried to dig my way around the cheese but there was so much it congealed into a goopy mess. The skillet looked super oily and the potatoes were just okay. 

I felt so unhealthy. I don't think I'd even come back to try another dish because the first time was so memorably bad. The only reason I gave it two stars was because our waiter was so polite and accomodating."
4839,Hash House A Go Go,5,So amazing...one meal is good enough for four people!!!!!i'll come back when I'll be in Vegas....thank you guys
4840,Hash House A Go Go,4,"hung over and looking for some good ol' greasy breakfast to fill your queasy stomach?

Head over to Hash House hidden within the shady alleys of Imperial palace.  Treat your stomach, who's probably still mad at you, to a satisfyingly greasy hot mess, they call on the menu: andy's special sage fried chicken benedict.  

So finger lickin good, it makes a girl like me feel guilty just by looking at it.  If you're not that into sauce, i would recommend getting it on the side, cus they drench this dish in it.  The sauce is good, but really heavy...I would split this with another hung over buddy.  The sizes are mighty hefty."
4841,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was amazing! We were staying across the street at Cesar's Palace and came here for lunch....need to do this every time we come to Vegas! The portions are huge and are a great value! The side order of the biscuit with gravy was enough for me to eat as a meal! My husband ordered the Snickers pancake combo and couldn't finish it....which is pretty unheard of for him! One word, DELICIOUS!"
4842,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I cannot get over how much food you get for a (comparatively) low price!  We've been twice now - once before the Imperial Palace became the Quad, and once since the Casino has switched to the Quad. Now, it is nearly impossible to find, down deep, dark alleyways, passed the very cramped concierge desk, down some steps. I'm sure the management at Hash House is not too impressed with this... but it has lead to a much shorter wait time! 

Come hungry and in your Thanksgiving Day fat pants. Don't come if you ""could eat, but not that hungry"" or if you plan on hitting the pool later.  I had the Andy's Sage Fried Eggs Benedict. It's bigger than an NFL football, swear to God. Inch thick layer of real mashed potatoes, two ginormous biscuits, a full chicken breast fried to perfection, a layer of eggs, some spinach, another layer of cheese, then topped off with the most sinful chipotle hollandaise sauce. Now, I'm a 5'8, 130 lbs girl but I can eat, that's for sure. I put this plate to shame and left with half a biscuit on my plate - drawing quite the praise and congratulations from our server who was thoroughly impressed. 

This restaurant is more of a spectator sport. Dishes are brought out when they are done, they don't use heat lamps so if you have a large crowd, some people will be left without a plate until their meal is done. In the mean time, you gawk at everyone else's ridiculous amount of food and at those who are stuffing their faces. 

We come here for breakfast and don't eat until lunch the NEXT day :)"
4843,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We met with family here for breakfast.  The portion sizes are ginormous. Their servers are friendly, The food is great.  There's not much that doesn't come with mashed potatoes.  Nobody was able to finish their food.  If you're a healthy eater,  order a lot of ala carte. The eggs were great,  and the hot chocolate was out of this world.  It's hard to find if you're not familiar with the area but if you self park at The Flamingo and walk straight through their casino,  past the Flamingo Habitat,  you'll see The Linq across the street and it's right inside. The escalators are marked HASH HOUSE."
4844,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I first heard about this place on Man vs. Food (big shock). I didn't realize that there were two locations- the one on Sahara, where MvF was taped, and this on, inside Imperial Palace. We were within walking distance of this one.
We made our way through the Reno-esque Imperial Palace casino, went up the escalator, and arrived at a near-empty restaurant on a Friday night. We were seated immediately. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was huge, and the waffles had whole strips of bacon in it. Yes, whole strips! Sadly, those were the highlights. The chicken didn't have much seasoning, unless you count the rosemary skewer that held everything together. Rosemary's a really strong herb, and I tasted it in every bite. I wasn't crazy about the reduction, either.

My husband had a fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes. Frankly, I liked his food more.

The service was great, and the waffles made great leftovers the next day. But otherwise, I left kinda disappointed. I wouldn't rule out coming back here when I'm in Las Vegas again, but I'll order something else."
4845,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So I just got back from Las Vegas and my last meal was at Hash House A Go Go. I love this place. I had the HH meatloaf hash. This comes with HH's famous meatloaf, potatoes, red peppers, the biggest biscuit I have ever seen, a slice of melon, 2 eggs cooked to your request and a strawberry. YUMMY!!! I have been to this location twice before. This time I sat at the bar because there was a wait. I didn't realize that they went from normal hours to being open 24 hours. I might have ate there sooner during a late night gambling or dancing on my latest trip. So i opted for the bar because I was so hungry. I knew better than to let my hunger order more than I dish since I was alone. I thought about getting their bacon waffle which is so delicious. But I knew I wanted more than just carbs and meat. Mark & Jayson were the bartenders on duty. Both guys are awesome!! They were very friendly and very attentive to their diners at the bar. So I had the meatloaf hash and it was very good. Of course, I couldn't finish it. Their portions at Hash House are ridiculously huge that you could split 1 entree with a friend and be stuffed for the rest of the day. I wish that I could have taken my leftovers with me to the airport, but there is some silly rules about bringing stuff like that through security check points. I would have given 5 stars for my review. The only reason I didn't was because the restaurant is located so deep inside the Quad that you couldn't get any type of cell reception or cell data. I definitely would recommend anyone going to Las Vegas that loves breakfast to try and stop by Hash House A Go Go before getting on a plane to head home!! Can't wait to get back to Las Vegas to eat here again!!"
4846,Hash House A Go Go,1,Didn't live up to the hype. Portions are definitely huge but the flavor was eh. Cool concepts and flavor combinations but like I said eh. I had the chicken and waffles. Presentation was beautiful. Service was also a slow. Took about 10 minutes for our waiter to come check on us after we were seated.
4847,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was conveniently located in the hotel I was staying in. I almost didn't go because of all the other food I was consuming but decided to stop in before I left for the airport & I am so glad I did!! The food was DELICIOUS!! I've heard great things about this place & wanted to check it out for myself. Some of the mixes on the menu seemed a little off and didn't make sense but once I got my food it all came together and I left there a happy girl! If you're in Vegas definitely check this place out!
4848,Hash House A Go Go,5,"That are amazing!!! Wonderful food, great drinks, and the portions can feed an army! Great service and it was in a good location."
4849,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We tried Chicago based on the open reviews we saw when we checked and there was a half an hour wait they gave us a ticket and we went in to the casino for a bit and came back they tried to see this in a table in the main dining room literally the very middle of the room I hated that so we moved to another room in the service was a little slow food was good, my smoked salmon omelet was just OK, potatoes were crunchy not flavored that well. My husband tried the chicken and waffles and that was pretty tasty,  Huge portion, we should have just ordered one thing and shared!"
4850,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great for the food and even better for the novelty of the HUGE portions they give you.  Not for the calorie conscious although I did see egg whites in the menu.  Go early because t gets crowded.  Make sure  you are hungry, you can't go wrong.  Same experience as the San Diego location."
4851,Hash House A Go Go,5,All I can say is I will definitely go back EVERY time I am in Vegas! They told us the wait would be an hour and we decided to wait because we had heard it would be worth it. We were seated within 15 minutes! We ordered one of their specialties (to share since we'd heard about their portion size) and it was delicious! Cannot wait to return!
4852,Hash House A Go Go,5,Definitely the place to go for breakfast when in Vegas. Portion sizes are huge. Shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and still we had left overs. We both ordered OJ and we could have shared those as well. Biscuits with the meal were really good as well as the crust on the chicken! Based on other reviews will have to go back and try the chicken and waffles.
4853,Hash House A Go Go,4,A very good brunch spot. The pancakes are HUGE! You get one but it is about the size of a hubcap. Nice atmosphere and good service. If you go closer to closing (2pm-3pm) prepare to wait for a table. I recommend this place.
4854,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The wait to get in for 3 people around 1PM was an hour wait on a Tuesday afternoon. Which isn't bad considering you can take a walk inside the casino for a bit before returning back to has house a go go. There's also very limited waiting seating so it's best to just come back when it's close to the time the hostess told you.

Holy crap, the portions are huge! If you don't want to waste food nor money, split it with someone! I got the quesadilla which was really heavy so I only ate like 1/3 of it and the person I shared it with also ate 1/3 of it so we had 1/3 uneaten.. so maybe even consider splitting it with 3 people if you don't really want a heavy breakfast. However, if you're craving comfort food for dinner or after a night out, maybe just split it with one other person.

What I didn't like was how it literally took us 15 minutes to eat but took us over an hour to receive two plates of food. The party that was sitting next to us got seated and ordered 20 minutes after us but their food came out before ours. It was a ridiculous waiting time and I don't think i'll be back to this specific hash house a go go if their customer service / food service is like this."
4855,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had a take out dinner then went back and dined in for breakfast.  It was so good; I would go again.  I didn't have an issue with the crowd because I called ahead for dinner and made a reservation for breakfast.

The food was delicious, and the portions were HUGE!  One dish serves more than 2.  For dinner, we had the stuffed meatloaf - would get it without the cheese if I were to do it again - but the meatloaf and the gravy were yummy.  For breakfast, we had the pancake, and wow.  It was so tasty.

The service was a little slow, but that is par for Vegas.  It was actually better than most restaurants."
4856,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fantastic!!!  Fantastic!!!  3 of us went and had fried chicken and bacon waffles, tractor special with french toast and biscuits and gravy.  Everything was delicious and Kye was amazing."
4857,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a MUST when in Vegas. I recommend breakfast and there is usually a wait so be prepared. The chicken and waffles are so so so good. The food is presented in a fun way and overall the food is extremely good! Don't skip this place, especially if your an early riser."
4858,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Do not come to this place on a 1/4 stomach; I repeat ""Do not come to this place on a 1/4 stomach"" because they give you large portions which is great for the money and taste. 

You should also plan to share with someone if you go with someone. I had the Man V Food favorite called the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. It was great. I could taste everything form the egg, chicken, maple, mashed potatoes. The only thing I wish is that there was more chicken. other than it was still great! Also, I had the crab cake to be extra greedy. haha! 

Recommend, recommend this place. You should probably go on a fast before coming here. That way you can eat and eat many items on the menu. 

~Good deal, no, great deal!"
4859,Hash House A Go Go,5,I really like their menu and decided to try the house specialty sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was delicious but the waffles which have slices of smoked bacon were a little too smoky for my taste. My friend loved it. I would order again but would prefer no bacon in the waffle. Staff was attentive and friendly. Place was cleaned were the bathrooms which is my reference to kitchen cleanliness!
4860,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yummm! 

This restaurant is nothing short of awesome. I had the meatball pasta and it was MASSIVE. I hardly put a dent in my food and it would have been perfect to share with someone else. The meatballs were cheesy, soft, and delicious. The spaghetti noodles were huge too. Our server was super nice and there was a short 15 minute wait at 9 p.m. on a Sunday night. Comfort food at its finest and another reason why I love The Quad."
4861,Hash House A Go Go,5,So good.  Food is as big as your head! The wait was long but it was during brunch so not unexpected.  The Server was friendly and helpful regardless of how busy they were and the food was delish!
4862,Hash House A Go Go,3,"came here after an interview, food was pretty good but it I expected better from all the raves.  The service was extremely bad, and there was hardly anyone there at lunchtime on a weekday.  Getting water refills was challenging.

I will probably try the Sahara location and see how it compares, since I have a few restaurant.com certificates that apparently this location at Imperial Palace won't take."
4863,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I like this place.  Every time we come to Vegas we come here.  The plates of food are for more than one person, or be prepared to take some home. 

This time I was disappointed. The wait staff were not attentive. They seemed to have a lot of tables and were rushed.  Service was sloppy.  Even my plate didn't seem put together well.  Just not the same...."
4864,Hash House A Go Go,2,"As a new resident to Las Vegas, I've taken it upon myself to eat at different places at least once a week.  This week it was Hash House A Go Go located at the Linc.  I'm a food snob, I admit it!  The service was good, didn't have to wait long for a table or food once I ordered.  The problem was, it was obscene!  Nobody should have that amount of food in one sitting.  It definitely wasn't great (I had the meatloaf sandwich), it wasn't even mediocre.  I brought home 3/4 of it for later.  It hit the garbage can today."
4865,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Bloody Mary was great! Coffee was on point!

Ordered the chicken, asparagus hash--the biscuit and jam was great! The hash was good--potatoes, eggs and some small pieces of asparagus. I probably would not order that again -- just okay.  My brother got the basic breakfast--it was just that basic.  

Solid breakfast spot! We sat at the bar to avoid the wait."
4866,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Finally getting around to writing a review for Hash House a Go Go. I visited Hash House a Go Go back in November.

Hash House a Go Go was highly recommended to me by a bunch of friends. I made my way here for dinner during and the experience was good. Just good. Not bad, but not excellent.

The menu was pretty extensive. I definitely had a hard time choosing which entree I wanted. I finally ended up with the corn beef hash. The entree was okay. It was good, but with all the hype and recommendations, I was really expecting to be blown out of the water.

Otherwise, everything else was awesome. The staff was friendly and professional. The venue was nice and clean. The overall experience was good. And the price was very relative for the strip. Entree and a soda ran me about $20-$23 after everything said and done.

I would definitely come back again, but instead of the corn beef hash, I would probably try something else.

I would rate this establishment a low 4 stars out of 5. If the corn beef hash blew me out of the water, I would have rated higher!"
4867,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place gets very very busy. We waited about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad. While waiting, we went downstairs to gamble for a little and came back and our name was called! I love their food! Everything is so tasty and the presentation of each dish is soo pretty! Portions are huge and enough to share with two people. My friend got the fried chicken and I heard they're known for their fried chicken here. I tried a couple bites and wish I ordered that instead! It was so tasty and crunchy. Super super flavorful with the fried onions on it. Such a good price for the amount of food you get. The only down side is that it took forever to get our food. Ohh well! The food made up for it though. I'll definitely come back for the fried chicken! Other items on the brunch menu is also good too! The fried chicken stood out to me the most"
4868,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing place for breakfast ...   I had the corned beef hash and it was made with plenty real corn beef!    The service was also very good.  It was a good thing that I had it at 5 am in the morning so I have the rest of the day to work it off (if that was even possible).
4869,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great brunch/breakfast place, giant serving sizes so sharing is probably the way to go."
4870,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best breakfast I've ever had. Their fried chicken and maple reduction sauce was amazing. I've never had anything like it. The portions are huge so it's worth sharing.
4871,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What a great experience ! The food was amazing, the staff was efficient and friendly, and the pricing was reasonable."
4872,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash house A Go Go: excellent presentation, excellent tasting. 

We order a few different items all of which I was told was great but I personally only tried one thing and that was the chicken Benedict. 

Sauce was on point, delicious 

Chicken was cooked perfect 

Bacon was cooked perfect

Mashed potatoes that everything sat on were perfect

Biscuits were fluffy yet flaky, another perfect 

Sausage gravy was great

All of these components when put together worked so well. This was one of the best breakfast/lunch dishes I've ever had anywhere. 
I was literally eating so slow so that I could truly enjoy each flavor that made up this dish. 

The wait was over a hour but once I tried my first bite it was well worth it. 

This dish is big enough to feed 2-4 people depending on your appetite. There was 2 of us on this dish and when we were done it almost looked as if it could have been re served to someone else as a full meal. 
I'm very happy our waitress recommended this plate for us. We ordered something completely different and before it had made it to the chef we decided to ask our waitress if we made the right choice or if we should have ordered this and she was happy to make the change before it was too late. We thank you for that. Because of you I ate my best meal of my Vegas trip!!"
4873,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Don't go here if you don't want type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, etc. etc. or if you just don't want to gain 12 pounds at breakfast.
Do go here if you're hungover and need a good comfort food carboload.
I snagged the veggie eggs benedict-eggs benedict and accompanying veggies were yummy but I don't want mashed potatoes for breakfast. Yes, they serve eggs benedict with mashed potatoes. Strange.
If I came back here I would order one meal for four, and definitely not so hung over so I could justify drinking beer out of a can in a paper bag. Cute."
4874,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Wet in a Friday morning. The place was packed and there was a decent wait of 30 minutes. The waiter seemed busy and was okay. The food was good. The prices were good for the amount of food and the quality of food. They were accommodating to all types (children, handicap, etc)."
4875,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place has good food. I had a Blueberry flapjack. Be prepared that you more than likely will not be able to finish this whole thing. The flapjack is big enough for 2-3 people!! I loved the fact that the flapjack was big but it only came with 2 little pieces of bacon and some eggs. What I mean is the flapjack is so big that the 2 pieces of bacon just become a tease. No one wants to run out of bacon when they have a giant pancake in front of them. Aside from that, the portions are huge, service is decent, and be prepared to spend $$. 

Advice : Go with a friend and split a plate & the check!! LOL"
4876,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time. We struggled with the hour+ wait to eat, but made it through. And it was worth it.

We ordered a lot, even though we were very aware of large portions this place was famous for. We just wanted to try everything. 

My boyfriend had the corned beef and a side of pancake. The pancake was monstrous! Biggest I've ever seen anywhere!
He liked his food, but wasn't as big of a fan as I was.

I got this salmon scramble concoction with potatoes. I also got the famous fried chicken and bacon waffles. Both were cooked perfectly and had so much flavor to them. The waffles were still sweet and buttery and the bacon only accented the flavor. The chicken was crispy in just the way you want it but super juicy on the inside. The salmon scramble had an interesting taste, different, but super good and rich.

Our server was also very nice. They were very busy so we had to wait a while for our food even once we got to the table, but we kind of expected that.

My only disappointment is that we couldn't bring the leftovers with us on the airplane."
4877,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I typically don't review places like these because with 2242 reviews, they have a great following.  Now I feel obligated because we've been going to Vegas every year, in March, for the last 7 years. We ate at the original HHGG off the strip years ago and loved it. Now the one at the quad/linq is 5 min walk from the hotel.    The food is always amazing and extremely filling.    HUGE portions but oh so good.  The prices for a place to eat on the strip also great.  

You can not go wrong eating here.   Period.  

Until next year HHGG"
4878,Hash House A Go Go,4,"located on the 2nd floor in the LinQ hotel/casino.
park at Flimingo Hotel and walk thru their casino  to where the outdoor shops are(and ferris wheel) into the next building(LinQ), go towards the right.

this is where they did MANvFOOD.
Busy place so come sooner than later on ur itinerary. once we got seated tho, we were waited on within 5min.

ordered the GO GO TRACTOR drink, first(17.99 incl take home tractor), you know, to 'start ya off'.
for meals, SAGE CHICKEN and CHiCKEN n BACON WAFFLE
if U have NOT tried a Hash House place, their portions are HUGE!!!  each plate can feed TWO people so keep that in mind if you are hungry/not hungry/on a budget/have kids with you!!
the chicken n waffles were great! crispy bacon cooked IN the waffle. big ass chicken pieces with hella crispy on it. 
the chicken sage is stacked and tasty, got scrambled eggs in between-its like a super carb overloader meal!! 
that GoGoTra tor drink is cool. its a toy tractor filled with a cocktail and afterward u clean it out and use the tractor to collect dust and save coins(piggy bank)

overall: up to 20 bucks a meal here is nice n filling per person and CAN be more worth the money to get ur feed on than at most places.  u will enjoy ur sit down."
4879,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We walked like 2 miles to get here because we heard it was the best breakfast to get nearby the strip.  It's not in the nicest hotel/casino on the prettiest part of the strip (I think it's actually on the old strip) but don't let that deter you.

We got in on a Sunday at about 1:30, and it was PAH-ACKED with people.  They told us the wait would be 45-60 minutes so three of us sat in the waiting room, and the other two went to the bar for coffee.  They came back a minute later and said there was enough room for 5 of us to eat at the bar, which was probably the best seat in the house - great service. Kye and Tiffany at the bar are awesome. 

We had drinks, friendly convo with the bartenders, and our food was delivered quickly. ..and BOY was it HUGE!!  Every plate could have been shared by 2-3 people and the banana pancake (singular) that the guy next to us got was literally *hanging* off the edges of the plate. 

I got the Roast Chicken Potato hash: chicken, mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus on top of roasted potatoes. Over medium well egg (?) and large biscuit on the side.  Oh and don't forget the wedge of watermelon!  Those things were also cocktail ornaments. I am not kidding.

The best thing about any place in Vegas, I sadly only took advantage of here, was the to-go alcohol cups. Wacky... especially coming from GA (aka the Bible Belt).  I felt like I was being really bad, but I liked it. 

The only bad thing?  The whole place was really warm.. maybe because it's on the top floor, and we were sitting at the bar (by the kitchen door.)  Bar is still worth it!"
4880,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've had a business card from Hash House a Go Go sitting on my desk since my last trip to Las Vegas. I've been meaning to write a review. I was traveling alone so I pretty much got seated immediately at the bar. Kind of odd having a full service bar during breakfast, but this is Las Vegas after all.

I saw lots of Mimosas and Bloody Mary's going out, but I stuck with coffee and an order of corned beef hash and eggs.

It was a Saturday morning and the place was quite busy but there was no problem getting refills on coffee directly from the bartender. Breakfast portion was huge and there was plenty of corned beef, a good portion of eggs, and skillet cooked potatoes. I also got toast on the side. Far too much food for my typical morning meal but I wasn't complaining, everything tasted great. My meal wasn't greasy, it wasn't overly heavy, but it certainly was filling.

Bartender was obviously busy but she had a great attitude and the place seemed to be humming along quite well on the morning I had breakfast. I don't know that it's worth the walk down the street if you're staying at another hotel, but if you're already in Imperial Palace and are hungry for grub, this place may just be the ticket."
4881,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food! The portions were huge and came out like a piece of art!

Food tasted amazing, definitely not your typical chicken and waffles or eggs benedict. Chicken was juicy and waffles came with bacon cooked in it! Eggs Benedict had fresh tomatoes and spinach!"
4882,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The BEST bloody mary I have EVER had! EVER! It comes with a giant straw for maximum consumption, and literally everything about it was perfect! 

This Hash House location is inside a pretty sketch casino, but the restaurant itself is quite nice and we didn't have a long wait for table even though the place was packed. Service was slow but I guess I expected it. The FOUR of us shared ONE meal (sage fried chicken benedict) along with a very nice fruit salad and it was the perfect little brunch! I am not really a food mixer, so I am weary of things with a lot of ingredients, but everything worked so well together and the sauce was amazing! But in all honesty, the champagne drinks and bloody marys are really the show stoppers here!!!"
4883,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went back to HH last week for New Years vaca and none of the problems as my first time. We did have to wait a good amount of time for our food...but, the waiter explained that when we placed our order it would take a lil while since what we ordered was made fresh...kinda makes the wait bearable...and I had the St. Mimosa with OJ instead of grapefruit  juice and it was SUPERFANTASICAL. ..I already loved St. Germain with champagne so it a was a natural choice for me...Food was excellent  as always...enough for two for sure. It's definitely a must go-to while in Vegas."
4884,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We put our names on the list and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes. We probably weren't seated till an hour and a half later.

All the reviews aren't lying when they say the portions are MASSIVE. I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with bacon mashed potatoes and a fried egg. The chicken was a bit dry and the mashed potatoes were bland. I also ordered a side of fried potatoes and sausage gravy, which ended up being uneaten because there's already so much food for one entree. Definitely don't recommend the fried potatoes though. They don't have much flavor to them.

My friends split the Chicken and Waffles and that was definitely a good idea. I really have no idea how one person can consume that much food in one sitting! The waffles were very soft and doughy, if you like that. I do so I really enjoyed them!

Everyone at our table seemed to enjoy their food. Not sure if I would come back though because there's just so many places in Vegas to try!"
4885,Hash House A Go Go,5,If you live brunch.  This is the best brunch place on the planet. With the best chicken and waffles on the planet ... The best part .. open 24 hours ... brunch time all the time
4886,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'd love to give this place 4 stars, and my reason for taking a star off might seem odd to some, but honestly... the portions are a little excessive. No one like leaving hungry, but at the same token, not many people I know like being presented with a plate holding enough food to feed 4 people easily. I had the crispy pork loin benedict, which was really tasty. The southwest sauce on it was perfect, but the scrambled eggs on top were almost superfluous. The pork loin covered my entire plate and was laid on top a big biscuit and mashed potatoes. I don't think I was able to finish half of it. I get that they're known for their ridiculous portions, but seriously... it was a bit much. 

Their bacon waffles (yes, there's strips of bacon IN the waffles) were really good. Super fluffy and a perfect balance of sweet and salty. Their biscuits are big and fluffy and are great with their homemade jam. I think their jam may have been some of the best i've ever had. And the kiwi watermelon lemonade was so so good! 

If they were to tone down their portions (you can keep them big without being insanely ginormous) I'd give them 4 stars."
4887,Hash House A Go Go,5,"After partying and playing Black Jack for about 36 hours the guys and I decided to try out Hash House A Go Go. We'd ask several people during our adventures what place would be the best to go if we were looking for some really good breakfast and almost all of them suggested Hash House.  Hash House is up a setup of escalators and has its own entire floor. There was a 1-hour wait for a group of 8 people, so we decided to go play some more Black Jack while we waited. Once our table was called we were led through the restaurant and it was then that we could see how touristy of a place this really was. There were pictures and posters hung up all around the walls and it felt like we'd just started another adventurous leg on our journey. 

The service, ambiance, and food were great, but I wouldn't be doing this review any justice if I did not talk about the food. The plates of food that you should be prepared to eat are simply massive. I would 100% recommend that you come prepared to eat on an empty stomach. No matter what you get on the menu it will definitely fill you up. Everyone in the group could agree that the food tastes great. I will definitely make it a point to go out of my way and visit again the next time I'm in Vegas."
4888,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great meal after our Vegas Ragnar experience.  Gary was spot on not only with his recommendations and with his service and his personality. Delicious and wonderful.
4889,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here last sunday for brunch. Had to wait 20 minutes to be seated which was fine (a friend told me she waited almost an hour last summer) but then I had to wait a over 30 minutes for my food to come. I have never waited that long for food. Especially since it was just the two of us and I'm the only one that ordered anything. Im guessing theyre understaffed. IDK.

4 stars anyway because the food was great (LARGE portions...the biscuit is HUGE and delicious) and the waitress was very nice. I'd come back for sure but I'd definitely bring something to snack on while I'm waiting. Lol."
4890,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My boyfriend and I got the corned beef hash to split. It was good but nothing to rave about or go out of my way for. The portion was huge, which was a definite plus. It had corned beef hash with country fried potatoes, an egg and a biscuit on the side.

The wait time is absolutely ridiculous here until it hits about 10 pm. From then til about 5 am, your in the clear and I say go for it!

Located inside of The Quad, on the second floor. 
The inside is relatively on the small side considering how popular this place is.

I would probably come back again, but try something different."
4891,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow. 

Incredible food and huge servings. I would definitely go again, but I'd probably split a meal with someone because 

Their Crab Cake Benedict is delicious. Crispy crab patties smothered in a spicy sauce and all on a huge bed of potatoes. Everyone else I was with was satisfied with our food. 

The lack of 5th star came from my drink. While it looked good and it tasted good, I don't think I could taste any alcohol, which was upsetting since I even upgrade to Kettle Vodka. 

So overall a very good experience, but that was the weakest drink I've had in Vegas."
4892,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The perfect place to go to when you've been out drinking all day and haven't eaten a thing.

Came here at 2am...or was it 3am?... on a Thursday (technically it was Friday by then). Thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app, it was easy to find what I wanted (the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict). 

Now when I ordered, I assumed that the photos that I saw were just extreme close ups, but nooooo, this thing is massive!!! Great mix of spicy and...I don't even know what else, but it was good. I wish that I would have taken it to go. It's a lot of food but it tastes great. 

Oh and the service was amazing. Someone in my group was drunk and rude, and kept asking for beer. The waiter was patient and continued to prolong the delivery of this beer which was what we all had hoped would happen. Food came out at a decent time. Long enough that you knew it was made to order, but short enough that you knew they weren't farming the chickens out back. I appreciate the service, the price point and the food. Can't wait to go back!"
4893,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you've been to any of the Hash House locations before, you know the drill - stupid large portions, expansive menu and great food. This Vegas location is no different and they do a pretty good job of dealing with the crazy weekend rush of people.

We showed up at noon on a Sunday and were told a 35 minute wait but only ended up waiting about 20, that was nice. The place was a zoo, people everywhere and not an empty table in sight. Sat, promptly ordered and everything was fine.

The food was great and service was good for a packed Sunday. We both got the #1 scrambles which came with healthy sides of potatoes, fruit and a giant biscuit. The food was actually reasonably priced at ~$14 a dish.

Two things that bothered me which brought this down from a four to a three star. We were asked if we wanted a side of sausage gravy with our scrambles. At no point was it mentioned that said side of gravy would end up being FIVE DOLLARS. Our waitress was so nonchalant about it, ""side of gravy or no gravy?"". Additionally, this place is an absolute cell dead zone. They do have free WiFi, but it is basically unusable and definitely underspec'ed for the location and volume of people. The restaurant should invest in cell spots and better wireless access points.

If you love breakfast food, this is the place to visit. Come hungry."
4894,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great food, great service. We wanted to go here more than once on our trip for sure.

I had the seasonal red velvet flapjack with eggs and bacon (amazing) anywhere I go I have to try red velvet and this was authentic (not fake tasting) red velvet with cream cheese drizzle and butter... Mmmm. But according to our waitress it is seasonal and not around for much longer! I also got the smores mocha because smores! I can't resist. This was good, had at least two inches of marshmallow on top though. I took the marshmallow off to actually get to the mocha. I wish more graham cracker was included to dip!

My friend enjoyed the fried chicken eggs Benedict (featured on man vs. food) it includes: chicken fried to perfection on top of bacon, eggs, biscuits, mashed potatoes, with grilled mozz and chipotle sauce on top. This was delicious too and not spicy at all. He also had a banana latte which he had last time he visited and had to get again.

My other friend had an avocado and bacon scramble which she enjoyed.

We all didn't finish our food but happily took it back to the hotel room to enjoy later. Can't wait to go back!"
4895,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you're looking for bang for your buck and by that I mean HUGE portions, this is a quality place to eat.  While there are definitely other places on the strip with higher quality, more flavorful food, most of them aren't offering portions this size.

I had  the Sage Fried Chicken and a Bloody Mary.  The Bloody Mary was the first one I've ever tried and it was delicious.  Peppery, with the perfect amount of Vodka mixed in.  The fried chicken was average and the bacon waffle was a little disappointing.  They basically throw a bunch of full pieces of bacon into the batter, throw it in the waffle iron and call them bacon waffles.  Good try, but the waffles just didn't have the flavor that I was looking for.

It wasn't a bad meal by any means though.  For the price, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth and I wouldn't be against coming back to this place next time I'm in Vegas."
4896,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ok this place is unique. The portions are really, really big. (I was going to say obscene but chose to say that they're just really really big you be the judge.)

Food quality is really good. They deafly know how to put the front of the food with some good flavor and some good product to boot.

Yeah get your butt over here. Check it out."
4897,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Biggest portions I've ever seen at a diner.  They're not just BIG portions, but the quality is top notch as well. I split the Sage Eggs Benedict with my GF and we both we stuffed.  

5 STARS!"
4898,Hash House A Go Go,4,Very good. Portions large. Can split between 2 people if you want. Service was a little long but very very busy. Some remodeling going on but out of the way. It's just. at the entrance. Prices ok. I would go back.
4899,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing breakfast.  The brown sugar banana pancake was absolutely amazing and recommended by our server.  

Amazing service and reasonable prices.  You need to go there!!"
4900,Hash House A Go Go,5,Most organized wait I have ever seen in my life!! We started with a long wait in line that was over in 20 mins. The staff is outstanding!! And there is a reason for the hype about this place overall- we ordered and shared the chicken and waffles and boy! Yummy!
4901,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Man Vs Food ain't got nothin on me!

It took us a while to find this place--we had to go on a long adventure through the ""extravagant"" Imperial Palace casino to find this place.  Hash House was packed, which was a good sign. I'm surprised this many people trudged through the casino to actually eat here.

Service was pretty good, although the ice water tasted pretty gross--it was probably just tap water.  Our server was very helpful in taking our orders, since it was our first time and we didn't know what to expect. 

 I ordered the Sage Chicken with a side of crispy potatoes. Man this thing was huge! Two breaded and deep-fried chicken breasts sat atop 2 biscuits, bacon, eggs, cheese, and mashed potatoes, and covered in a chipotle sauce. It was messy, down and dirty, and I felt my arteries clog up with each bite--just the way I like it. You've got to eat this right away, otherwise all it all becomes soggy and not as tasty as it could be. After tackling this heavy meal, the tap water wasn't so bad at all. The Crispy Potatoes weren't that good--they were burned and a little dry. I should've opted for the side of Sausage instead.

Of course, major food coma is to be expected afterwards--the host commented on how slow we were walking. All of us were dragging our feet as we left. Nobody wanted to do anything but just lay around and nap. We ate this meal at around 1pm....9 hours later none of us were hungry yet."
4902,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We had a weird experience at this place.  First, I called around lunch time to ask about a dinner reservation for that same night.  The woman on the phone asked me what time and I said 5 to 5:30.  She took my info and said, ""okay, we have you down for 3 people at 5:00 to 5:30 tonight.""  I just said thanks.  I wasn't too worried as we were eating early and I doubted we'd have to wait anyway.

When we show up and I tell the guy at the front that I called earlier and made a reservation, he said, ""I don't think so as we don't take same day reservations.""  Then he checked the book and said, ""oh, here you are,"" and showed us to our table.

When our server came to take our drink order, my friend asked for a rum-based cocktail and the server said that they didn't have rum, but that they have vodka cocktails.  We asked for a few more minutes and then asked her to switch the tv channel (the place was pretty empty and we pretty much had a tv to ourselves) to the women's world cup. 

After she left I turned around and looked at the restaurant bar and noticed that they had every spirit under the sun, so my friend went up and talked to the bartender, who easily made her a mai tai.  With rum.

Things perked up after that.  The tv channel was changed so we could watch the soccer game, we all ended up with delicious drinks; and the food was outstanding.  Two of us ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs were delicious, but the pasta was a little heavy on the sauce.  Otherwise, it was your pretty standard spaghetti and meatballs (though apparently they use a funky pasta that is hollow in the center, which you really couldn't discern while eating it).  My other friend ordered the sage fried chicken penne pasta and it was outstanding.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and the porcini mushroom cream sauce was to die for (and I hate mushrooms)!

So, all in all, the food was really good, the drinks were good, the service warmed up and we had a good time."
4903,Hash House A Go Go,5,"YAY, another Hash House A Go Go, this time in Vegas. LA LA LOVE IT! I discovered this place in San Diego, where they have one and it is definitely something worth coming to. Each dish comes out in a giant oval plate that I swear can feed a family of 4. Their pancakes are all unique and ginormous!! It is just a fun place to go. Not only is their plenty of food but everything you order is great. They have some of the best bloody mary's you'll ever have. I'm soooo happy they have one in Vegas now too. They definitely have a hooked, loyal customer in me. :)"
4904,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hash House A Go Go in Imperial Palace YOU SUCK

First off your staff is rude!! Unpleasant and you can tell they didn't want to be there.  Don't give your customers stink faces or stare them down.  

Secondly make sure you serve food without hair.   Our friends found a cute little curly hair in their meal.  They did end up taking it off the bill but seriously it ruined every ones appetite.

Lastly, the portions are large but they don't compare to the portions in SD.  I kept telling everybody to be astonished by the portions.. They weren't!! Maybe I'm just getting fat or i eat too much but i remember the portions in SD were humongo! We had to take 3 boxes full of food last time! 

The food was good, just not as good as the one in SD!! SHAME!!!  I would have given you one star, but the yummy Andy's sage fried chicken saved your rating. 

THUMBS DOWN! I'll be making another trip to the SD location!"
4905,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We recently had Brunch at The Hash House @ The Linq.. The Hostess was very friendly as we arrived he sat us at a booth and said our waitress, Rachel would come shortly. Rachel came quickly and took good care of us. She was very friendly, funny, had an answer for all the questions we asked on the menu, very efficient and quick to get our order out on a timely matter. If you get a chance to go in for a Bite make sure you ask for Rachel! The food by the way is delicious and served in BIG portions.."
4906,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My friend Michelle saw this restaurant on Man v. Food and she wanted to try it. We came here for lunch on the first day we were in Vegas. I didn't see this restaurant last time I was in Vegas, so I'm guessing it's fairly new. It's in Imperial Palace on the upper level. My friends and I had to wait for about 15 minutes before getting seated. We were looking over the menu and the Sage Chicken and Waffles caught my eye. I was stuck between the Chicken and Waffles and the Tractor Driver Combo. 

As we were called in, I saw that other people's portions were HUGE! The plates were big and the food was also big!  I had to come to a final decision and the winner was Chicken and Waffles. After seeing one from the table next to us, my friend Jenn and I decided to share. Good thing we did because we were STILL unable to finish one plate! The waffles were thick and fluffy and also stuffed with bacon inside! Major plus, since I LOVE bacon! The chicken was surrounded with leek and a stick of sage that was pierced into the chicken. The sage was a little too overpowering for me, but it was something different. My friend Michelle ordered the Strawberry Pancakes and it was the biggest pancake I have ever seen! I don't recall her finishing it all because it was so much! 

This place was very good and the service was mediocre. It took a while to get our food but I think it was worth the wait! Once again, the portions were HUGE and the prices were pretty decent compared to other restaurants on the strip."
4907,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hands down the best meal I've had in Vegas in years!!!  The Chorio Hash was unreal and our service was awesome!
4908,Hash House A Go Go,5,Oh my Goodness!' Try the Truckers Flapjacks with bacon & brown sugar pancake. Crispy bacon cooked in the pancake and brown sugar crusted on top. Can't forget the mashed red potatoes.
4909,Hash House A Go Go,3,"3.5 stars. Chicken and waffles looked better than they tasted. Chicken was crispy but could have been seasoned more. The waffles were okay but were a little doughy and hard to cut. The maple syrup wasn't real maple syrup. They call it a syrup reduction but it tasted like Aunt Jemima. And it came with a bunch of wilted greens on top which was weird. Portion size was HUGE, more than enough for two people easily."
4910,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best place for breakfsat in vegas. Tasty food. HUGE portions. Their chicken special is to die for. Yes, I said chicken for breakfast. They have plenty of other stuff if that isn't for you, but you will regret it lol. Great price for the quality and quantity. never more than a 5-10 minute wait. must go-to if you are in Vegas."
4911,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great hash
Great service
Great atmosphere
Fast
What else is there?
Wish they had one in Colorado"
4912,Hash House A Go Go,4,"when I was told that we would be going to lunch at Imperial Palace the snob in me instantly was like OMG ew......   my friend assured me I would not be disappointed... so I bought into it.... ""ok lets go""   as we walked to our table i began to notice that this place is INSANE for serving size...  my order was the kokomo sandwich (meatloaf sandwich with 2 oversize pieces of texas toast as the bread and a humongous serving of french fries... other items at my table were a pancake the size of Oregon, Pork something or other doused with creamy bbq sauce that... that thing looked and tasted delicious....  of course someone had to get the Man vs Food  - sage chicken....  which was delicious....  I dont think people use the word delicious enough by the way!   overall I was super impressed....  I cant wait to go back!"
4913,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My brother, boyfriend, and I checked this place out a little over a week ago while in Vegas. It took us a while to figure out a good place to eat breakfast at since we decided to walk along the Strip to hunt down a Fat Tuesday. But we ended up back at my brother's hotel to try their in house restaurant.

We took a set of escalators up to the second floor to get to the restaurant. It was fairly packed and they had told us that it would take about 45 minutes to be seated. They didn't have beepers to let you know when to come back, but we decided to just stick around the a lot machines downstairs and walk around outside before coming back up to wait there for 10 minutes. Seating was scarce to find when waiting, so we hung out by the wall near the elevator where there were plaques of menus with signatures and pictures with the corresponding star.

We finally were seated and I settled for their signature chicken and waffles while the boys decided to get the spicy hamburger. Between the three of us, these two dishes were definitely enough and over. They serve such big portions that I couldn't imagine trying to finish a dish by myself.

I really love the touch of rosemary on the chicken and how light and fluffy the waffles were, which had sticks of bacon inside. The hamburger was really juicy and the fries that came with it were bomb. We ended up having leftover chicken and waffles that my brother willingly took for a snack opportunity later on.

Definitely will consider coming back here to check out other dishes!"
4914,Hash House A Go Go,4,A great place to have a filling breakfast with plates averaging between 15$-20$. You get what you pay for which is a lot of food! I ordered The Tractor Combo which came with two eggs and a meat orbiting around my 12 inch pancake! I swear this thing was bigger than that. Food is good the pancake was average in taste. I suggest maybe spending the extra 4 dollars to upgrade your pancake flavor. Red Velvet sounded good! Overall would recommend.
4915,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hands down was one of the best chicken and waffle we ever had. A friend of ours recommended it to us and she forgot to mention that the serving was huge haha. 

I felt very disappointed with their shrimp appetizer. Way too over pricey. I believe it was 9.99 for 3 pieces of shrimp on a stick. 

Good selection of drinks and dessert tho."
4916,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hubby and I were in Vegas and I had heard about this place and seen it on food network so we decided to give it a try..and I have to say we were NOT disappointed..I got the sage fried chicken and waffles and my hubby got a combo with a banana cinnamon pancake, bacon and eggs...The portions as you may have heard are HUGE and well worth the money..Both were very delicious and neither of us had any complaints..well aside from the fact that I thought there could have been a few less leeks on top of the chicken and waffle ""tower""...but next time I just know to ask for none...we left with leftovers of course and ate on them for the next two days...lol...we definitely will be going back our next trip to vegas...I did see some comments here about the wait time but that was not out experience..we went on a Saturday somewhere between 1:30-2:30pm and only waited about 15-20min for a table then the waitress did tell us that it would be a wait for the food since they make everything fresh but it came out in about 20min or so...maybe less...and we were expecting a wait...I mean this is Vegas.."
4917,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is fun.  I've heard about long lines, etc but maybe I was lucky because I never had that trouble. 

Huge, I mean HUGE portions of food, so I would recommend sharing.  I couldn't finish my pancake (singular).  My favorite menu item was ""The Hangover"" it's a 25ounce can of Budweiser and 5 strips of bacon.  Classic.

Service staff was fun and entertaining every time. If you have the chance, check it out!"
4918,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Pancakes bigger than your head, portions that can serve more than one, staff that are friendly and fun. I love this place! I tasted a bit of everything, by I had the corned beef hash which was awesome. I had a feeling that the portions would be hugs, so I passed on the eggs."
4919,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food were different and great...
 I really liked the food there...I got a chicken and waffle... the portions was pretty huge..."
4920,Hash House A Go Go,3,The portions are great! the service can be spotty at times especially when they are busy.
4921,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very good food and drinks, servings are entirely too big but still it's a great dining experience"
4922,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Staying at Harrah's, I decided to try the Hash House at the Quad. Since the Quad is undergoing massive renovations, getting to it is quite the adventure but once I did find it, was worth it.  I had the corned beef hash, with plenty of shredded corned beef, you won't go hungry here!  I'll gladly return!"
4923,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Had breakfast here on a Sunday morning, got early enough for a little bit of wait for two 

The hosts were very friendly. The server Toby was fast and caring. He listen to my Allergies to Maple and got me honey instead for my French toast..

Speaking of the French toast, were delicious. Had fried bananas on the side and oranges. 

Coffee was good too. 

The portions were big, we couldn't finish our food, but that is a good thing cause we were full and satisfied. 

Totally recommend this place"
4924,Hash House A Go Go,1,Don't understand the hype. Party of 5 in front of us couldn't be seated. No idea why. Service was so SLOW. Food mediocre. SKIP.
4925,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A bit of a wait for brunch but its not too bad. Just go back down the casino for a few minutes. 
I got the meatloaf hash and my gf got the sundried tomato hash. Mine was very filling, a bit salty but very good and cheesy. Lots of food which we ended up packing to go and eating the next day.
THe mushroom, artichoke, sundried tomato hash was a bit sour. The artichoke and tomatoes were overpowering and made the whole dish very acidic and difficult to eat.
We also had a bloody mary which was decent.
All in all, its quantity over quality. If you want to get a big bang for your buck you can check it out, but you're gonna feel super full after eating here."
4926,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Went for breakfast today with 2 friends (all first timers). Sadly, we were not impressed. Our server was friendly and nice. But the food was bland and to top it all off I got sick, stomach ache for most of the day. I ordered the chorizo hash, btw. Will not recommend or go back."
4927,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was the best chicken and waffles I've ever had! My friend and I shared the Sage Fried chicken and waffles (smart move, the portions are ginormous!!) The chicken was crispy outside and nice and juicy inside. The bacon waffles were a nice surprise with the bacon cooked inside the waffles. We added an order of hash browns to round out the meal. The music was bangin' too. Great place to have good food, dance a little bit in your chair, and good conversation. A Vegas must!!!"
4928,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Out of town friends introduced me to Hash House A Go Go on the Strip.  My friend always orders the Chicken and waffle dish.  At first I thought EEEWWAH! But then when I tasted it I was in HEAVEN!!! I'm hooked on this place so when ever they come to town I get treated to a dinner there and I either order the chicken and waffle plate or the Sage chicken Salad. Soooo GOOD!!!   The only complaint I have is they play the music too loud so it's hard to have a conversation if this place is crowed, which it usually is!"
4929,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Massive portions! I had breakfast there and couldn't finish it, their hash browns were extra good. The waiter was super nice and chill, even though it was a packed house."
4930,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you're hungry, this place had huge portions for the price and really kind and attentive servers. Honestly, it seemed like it had all the potential to be amazing food, but was unexpectedly bland. I got a veggie hash and most of the veggies were canned and overly greasy. Also splurged on bread pudding to find it was super dry and resembled more of a chocolate bread cake."
4931,Hash House A Go Go,5,"5 stars for the chicken pot pie and the great service!

If I could, I would marry that chicken pot pie...
As you can tell, that's what I would highly recommend. The corn beef with a side of potatoes was bland, dry, and boring. The chicken and waffle is as good as the rest of these yelp reviews say and so are the huge portions! 
I had chicken pot pie for 2 more meals afterwards and I loved it!!"
4932,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went for breakfast and it was HUGE, I ordered a biscuit w my meal and it was as tall as a Cambell's can of soup. While the biscuit was really tall, it wasn't light and fluffy, it was kind of heavy actually, IDK how to make lighter biscuits - mix in more air? different ingredients? it was too much of a good thing.
I went to the one on Sahara, it was a fun experience and if you're into huge portions this is the place for you. The waitress was knowledgeable about the dishes and service was very good.
I don't think I'll go again, I think it has more hype than excellent food and for the money I'd rather go to an upscale hotel buffet."
4933,Hash House A Go Go,5,Perfect place to eat if you are hungry. Portions are humongous!! Hubby & I split the meatloaf plate but we barely finish it!
4934,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Visited August, 2010 

I had been wanting to come to this place for sooooooo long, like back when there was only one. Finally I got my chance, while my Aunt & Uncle were visiting. We showed up on a Sunday, around brunch time I guess. The place was understandably busy & we ended up waiting about 45 minutes to be seated, not too bad. However, once we were seated, it took a little while before a server showed up. 

Once our order was taken, it took about another 45 minutes before my Aunt & Uncle's food showed up. Where was mine? I figured it might be out next, seeing as how these are not your normal sized meals. So, after about 10-15 minutes & still no food, I finally flagged down my server & asked for my food. He replied that it would be out shortly that there had been a mistake. Shortly after, a Manager came out & apologized & said that my meal would be taken off of the ticket. Personally, I think when something like that happens, the whole ticket should be comped, because it is an inconvenience to everyone.  Just saying. 

I finally received my order, Griddled French Toast & freshly squeezed tangerine juice. I would probably go so far as to say that it was well worth the wait :P For as huge as this meal was, it was definitely no match for me, because by that time I was super hungry!! 

All I know is, that aside from the service, for that day anyways, the food was GREAT!! The french toast, tangerine juice & the homemade strawberry preserves are ridiculously good!! You really can't bet the portions either, so definitely come hungry or be prepared to share. 

Overall it is a great place & I would definitely go back. If it hadn't been for the service & the wait for my food, I think it would have been worth 5 stars."
4935,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The legendary Hash House A Go Go located in The Linq! I was pretty excited to try this place out and already knew what I wanted to order before I even stepped in to the hotel. We got the chicken and waffles. Duh. Get there early (like before 9 am), because lines start forming and this place gets packed! Obviously they are known for gigantic portions here, so definitely get a dish to split between two or even three people! The waffles were a bit dry, and the chicken needed salting, but it was pretty good. And certainly impressive; someone at the table next to me even asked if they could take a photo. My boyfriend and I also got 2 mimosas and the total was $50. 

The second time we went (yes, twice in the same visit - it's so convenient and our friends wanted to go again!), we got Andy's benedict, which is a ridiculous behemoth of a dish that includes mashed potatoes, two biscuits, two fried chicken breasts, a thick blanket of crunchy cheese, bacon, and chipotle cream sauce. Unghghhhh it was so much food but I powered through and was able to finish most of my half (except for the biscuit... I don't really like biscuits. And these were pretty dry). 

The server we had on our first visit was awesome - super friendly, helpful, attentive and nice without being annoying or overbearing. He was also quick and we never had to ask him for anything. My boyfriend and I both commented that this guy is like the gold standard for servers. 

Overall I don't think I'd visit again, now that I've been twice. It's pretty gimmicky and ridiculous with the amount of food you get, and the food is decent but nothing amazing, to-die for. If you like pancakes, check this place out. They are basically the size of manhole covers."
4936,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Best place for breakfast in Vegas. Their dishes are so huge that one plate will be enough for three people haha. Great food, quick and efficient service. In one word... EXCELLENT!"
4937,Hash House A Go Go,5,Maple bacon waffles and sage fried chicken was so yummy good but need two to split this plate. 4 waffles and two chicken breasts for $18. Bloody Marys were the bomb.
4938,Hash House A Go Go,3,The food is absolutely amazing. The wait however is not. It took an hour to get three of us seated. I ordered the man vs. food item (chicken Benedict) and it was delicious. The food is so good it makes you almost forget about the terrible wait.
4939,Hash House A Go Go,2,Loooooong wait for food.  Took our dishes 40+ min to come out.  Almost amusing that my meatloaf dish came out without meatloaf.  Ha!  They brought out the meatloaf a little later.  2 stars for huge portions and nice waiter.  Won't be back
4940,Hash House A Go Go,5,Nothing but good things to say! We recently visited Vegas and actually ate twice. First time with a large crowd of about 20. No issues accommodating us. Favs --chizoro house hash and the chicken house hash. The brown sugar flapjack was amazing!  Unbelievable bang for your buck!
4941,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Came here for brunch with some ladies and saw so many reviews on the chicken and waffles that I felt the need to try it! I was a little disappointed with the service we received.  The server had to be reminded several times for something, like cream for our coffee, extra garnishes for our drinks, extra sides we ordered, etc... even though we reminded him several times for lemons, he kept forgetting which got irritating. It came to a point where we had to approach another server for lemons. 

Now the chicken and waffles that everyone has been hyping about.  The chicken skin was delicious and crunchy.  The chicken itself was super dry.  The waffles were very surprising with the bacon inside of it.  Waffles were also dry.  There was a little side of syrup, but I felt like the syrup was needed to drench the chicken and waffles to give them the moisture that it was lacking. 

Overall I wouldn't suggest this place because of their disappointing service and dry chicken and waffles. The only thing nice about it is you can't smell the cigarette smoke from the downstairs casino."
4942,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love this place. Everything is amazing! If you're a foodie, you have to check out this place. Fun atmosphere and killer food."
4943,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House is reliable. You can be sure that this place will conquer your hungover ass with the largest plates of food you can imagine. Texas doesn't have anything on the size of the dishes here. 

The food is immaculate, speaking in terms of Andy's sage fried chicken benedict, It will blow your mind. Get that and maybe the pecan french toast and you and your partner are set.

Come here hungry, go for a long walk, take a nap, then start drinking again. Perfect."
4944,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Just an Overrated breakfast spot in Vegas.

They seem to focus more on presentation than flavor. The portions are big but the flavors are way off. 

Positive:

*The presentation looked great.

*Big portions for the price.

Negative: The taste 

*There was nothing special about the waffles even with the bacon inside. Just Tasted bland.

*The chicken breast had no flavor. Seemed like they focused on the crust and forgot to season the chicken.  

*The scrambled eggs tasted funny. How do you mess up on scramble eggs?  The eggs Tasted very generic...it's  like they added some type of filling to make it seem more. 
Me and my friend both looked at each other with disappointment after tasting it.

I should have Go Go gadget my ass out of there when I had the chance!"
4945,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love the Hash House!! The food Is really good and creative looking. It Is a bit on the pricey side but you figure for how good and preety the dishes come out, It Is worth the price."
4946,Hash House A Go Go,5,"PORTIONS!! Wow. It's one thing to serve a lot but putting out awesome tasting food is a plus. I also love that the server tells us our plates might not come out together bc they don't use microwaves or heat lamps. Fresh is king when it comes to food! I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken, which was a big battered chicken breast w/maple reduction, bacon, bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit. Chicken was hot, juicy, and flavorful. The bacon mashed potatoes I wish I could order by the tub, they were so good! Sausage gravy I had on the side was good too, could have been a little better but it did have large sausage chunks which I liked. If I'm ever near a Hash House again I have to stop in."
4947,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food was delicious, but the service was exceptional. I went with my friend and we were brought to a booth, but there was some leftover syrup on the seat and my friend unfortunately sat in it and stained his pants. Our server did everything he could to help my friend. He cleaned up the seat, brought over a linen and a bowl of hot water with lemon so my friend could remove the stain. The busser also came over to see if there was anything else he could do. The service impressed me so much and that alone will bring me back here! They really care about customers."
4948,Hash House A Go Go,5,This was our first stop after landing in Vegas. The food is delicious and the plates are HUGE! My husband and I shared the Tractor Driver Combo and still couldn't finish it!
4949,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were in town for a few days & my friend said this was the best breakfast spot so of course we went. It was super crowded, but we got in quickly because my friend had some type of card where we didn't have to wait in line. 
The food was Massive & delicious. I had the chicken & waffles. The waffle was fluffy & little crispy. The way I like it. The chicken was really flavorful, moist & crispy. My friends had the pork chop & eggs, Giant pancakes and a few other meals (there were 7 of us) everyone was satisfied. 

The service was fast & friendly. 

I'll be back next time I'm in town!"
4950,Hash House A Go Go,5,"TAWNEY PROVIDED THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER... working in the customer service field allllws me to see a lot. Great customer service is truly a lost art.... BUT NOT HERE.... TAWNEY was simply amazing... she gave us food recommendations, suggestions and was extremely polite! The food was AMAZING!!! We will be back for sure!!!! Thank you again!!"
4951,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great place!!!! Order the Biscuit and gravy with a fried egg though. Also the burgers are awesome....Kids plates can easily be shared between 2 kids...even if the eat a lot.
4952,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Walked here from the Elara and it was worth it.  Not crowded early in the morning, and service was friendly and attentive.  The food came out much quicker than expected."
4953,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great way to start or continue the day. Large portions and great Bloody Marys! It was a big crowd about an hour wait, but was worth it. Should try it after a night of partying!"
4954,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I always try to see positive, but this place is not good at all. First of all when we came after our long flight to eat there was 5 tables max, but the host told us to wait 5 min. We waited for 25 min!!! It was empty Restaurante!!! Where is the manager?!! If they would give us the table, we would start with drink and make them so money. When we finally got the table and order food, I was waiting for my salad over 20 min. I mean what you do there with lettuce???
Food was not good at all. My salad was too salty, my bfs scramble eggs tasted weird he even didn't eat it. Their famine kiwi watermelon cocktail tasted like cucumbers. Awful experience. Hope they will close soon."
4955,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food, but very large portion sizes! Fun, casual atmosphere. I'd come here again for a casual breakfast."
4956,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was the BEST breakfast! The French toast was incredible! I also had scrambled eggs with cheese and it was probably the best eggs I've ever had! The service there was spectacular, we had Amanda as our server and even though they had a wait she never once rushed us. Excellent service and even better food!"
4957,Hash House A Go Go,2,Meh. Cold food piled high in plates. Even if it were hot it still wasn't tasty and way too over priced. I won't be going back.
4958,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was actually looking for another spot, but was getting complicated to find and I was already getting hangry! When I saw the sign for Hash House A Go Go I remember reading about this place and decided to go in. This was actually for the best! I got one of their stuffed burgers and highly recommend. This makes the list of my top favorite burgers! When you are going with someone you can actually split in half, is a standard double patty and do try the fries! Sharing actually leaves room for some dessert which look good but had to pass, like I mention the portion is enough for 2! Either that or room for some drinks. Pinky up*"
4959,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wait is kinda long, but it was definitely worth it.  I just played craps to pass the time."
4960,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The menu is good, everything looks delicious - the one thing you don't realize is the size of the food that is about to descend onto your table! The hamburgers we ordered were mammoth two 1/2 lbs. patties with cheese and goodness melted between the meat. The fries were delicious and if you can get a half a burger into you, you're a king. Leftovers are guaranteed and I have to agree with their slogan,""if you leave hungry it's your own fault"". 
Prices were more than reasonable for the Vegas Strip and service was great at two different locations. Great place to visit, just make sure you're ready to carry a doggy bag the rest of the night."
4961,Hash House A Go Go,4,I was so excited during my review that I forgot to mention what I ordered! I ordered the chorizo hash with mushrooms and spinach on the side. I mixed the mushrooms and spinach in with the hash and it was excellent. The biscuit that comes with the hash is huge and fluffy. The apple jam is amazing. I also ordered a side of syrup to go with my biscuit.
4962,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Simply put: Delicious with LARGE entrees.  

I ordered the meatloaf here ($20) and it literally could have lasted a few meals. There was no way that I would be able to finish it in one sitting unless I didn't eat for like a few days.  It was sooooo good too.  It came with 2 chunks of meat and then the bottom chunk was mashed potatoes with cheese.  Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it again!

My friends ordered the chicken pot pie and another entree (chicken and biscuits I think?) and the chicken pot pie was larger than the size of my head.  It was delicious as well as I stole a bite of theirs! 

The service was attentive and came back to check on us a few times as well as refilled our waters promptly.

You definitely should be prepared to have leftovers!

I will DEFINITELY be back next time I'm in Vegas.
Also, they're open 24/7 :)"
4963,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Seriously don't waste your time! I don't like to trash places but this was so horrible I have to say something.

My friend and I visited Las Vegas for a little trip and heard people raving about this place. I really don't know what happened between then and when we went, but this was such a bad experience. After ordering, it took 30-40 minutes to get our meal. I understand it was busy, but that's not acceptable. The food finally arrived and it was HORRIBLE....completely inedible. My scramble tasted terrible and included their version of a home fry, as well as a biscuit. The home fries were burnt and cold. I'm not sure how they managed that, but it was pretty disappointing. I couldn't stand to eat my food so I sent it back and didn't get a replacement. I think I can count the number of times I've sent a meal back on one hand, so don't think this happens often.

I also noticed several other groups waiting excessively long for their meals and also sending their food back for being cold. I really want to know what was going on that day that we had such a bad experience yet other people seem to love it."
4964,Hash House A Go Go,3,"3 1/2 stars.

Came here for dinner on our night of arrival to Vegas. I always wanted to try it but always backed out after seeing how huge the portions were. But this time we were staying at the Linq hotel and Hash house a go go was there so thought we would give it a try. I hear it gets pretty packed, especially during brunch hours, not sure if they take reservations but just keep in mind there can be a wait. We came for an early dinner so luckily there was no wait. 

The menu has lots to choose from so good if you come with a big group. They have everything from burgers, entrees, salads, pastas and a few late night breakfast items. They bring you a complimentary basket of huge biscuits with honey drizzled on top. We all split it in half as they were as big as my face. The biscuits were warm and soft in the inside but a nice crust on the outside and the honey, sweet lord it was the perfect way to begin our dinner.

_Hash House Cobb Salad. Mixed greens, smoked chicken, blue cheese, fresh tomato, red onion, avocado, blue cheese, smoked bacon all tossed blue cheese dressing and trimmed with barbecue sauce. I had a feeling this salad was going to be packed with dressing. And sure enough it was not only drenched in dressing but with blue cheese as well. You think your are getting a salad because you want something a little light and something with greens but you end up getting one of the heaviest and richest because of all the dressing and blue cheese which is already full of flavor as a small dose. The greens were wilted and not as crunchy because of the dressing. My gf did not eat much of it. 
_Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower. Drizzled with hot maple reduction & fried leeks. The name says it all, as it really came out in a high tower! 3 amazing waffles that were nicely toasted and soft inside, and even better that there were bits of bacon inside. A nice combo of sweet and salty when drizzled with the maple syrup. The fried chicken was okay. I think too much of a thick better and not enough chicken itself. Still great when eaten all together with the chicken, waffle and syrup. The combo is just a sensational flavor that makes you dance inside. 
_The Basic. Two egg breakfast any style, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham). I got this as I did not want too much of a heavy meal before we start the night out. Very standard, nothing amazing. I got egg whites, and although it says 2 eggs I felt it was 3-4.. Not complaining but I've made egg whites many times and it's never that big hahaha. The sausage were good, a bit salty and a tad  sweet, nice to bair with my bland and healthy egg whites. I did not eat the biscuit but the cut potatoes were great and nicely crispy. The fruit was just a slice of cantaloupe. You think you are eating healthy but the portions are so huge we basically did family style so I ate a little of everyone's dish. 
_Pork Ribs. Pork ribs on smashed potato, steamed carrots, green beans  with a demi glaze sauce. I kind of made this title up as I did not see it on the menu so I just described what was on the dish haha. My gf thought the pork rib would be like Park's bbq ribs or Southern or Texas style bbq ribs but it was almost like a cutlet of ribs where there is bones but you can almost cut the knife into it. It was good but nothing amazing, the sauce could have been worked on as it was a bit salty and something in it was missing, it was not that memorable. The smashed potatoes were great with the pork. My fave was the green beans/haricot verts. Very thin and slightly crunchy and the sweet sauce just soaked in. I was not a huge fan of the cooked carrots, very bland and just seemed tossed in to add some veggies and colors. A pretty solid dish overall.

The portions are HUGE! think of Man vs. food so I recommend sharing a plate for 2 people. You may think it's pretty pricey, but for the portion you get what you pay for."
4965,Hash House A Go Go,4,Really delicious breakfast items...but you can't make many changes to the actual menu item.  We ended up having to order multiple meals to get everything we wanted.  Try the watermelon kiwi lemonade...amazing!
4966,Hash House A Go Go,4,"MASSIVE PORTIONS. I've only been here twice, both times at approximately 6am. The food was awesome, super greasy which was exactly what I needed. (Thank you Vegas.) But honestly at any other hour of the day, I wouldn't come here. Average diner breakfast food, and the portions are borderline disgusting."
4967,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place was simply amazing the food was out of this world great for breakfast brunch or a 3am snack.  I had the corn beef hash skillet and it was on point! There was a 1+ hour wait for seating but we snuck by and sat at the bar and ordered food less than 10 mins after arriving.
4968,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're looking for big meals with interesting ingredients this is a sweet spot. To the best of my knowledge I've only ever gone for breakfast, but I'm pretty sure I've had drinks during those occasions. I've been here more than once, and I've helped friends finish their meals. Big Eats here. Try the meatloaf!"
4969,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is one of the few must-do's in LV, IMHO. On my recent man-cation, we chowed down here 3x in 5 days. Dinner/lunch options are good, but go here for Bkft.

Lots of great Bkft options. The Scrambles & the Hashes are good, but my 2 recs are the Andy's chicken benedict and the Banana pancake. HUGE portions. Coffee drinks are very tasty (try ""The Smores"") and are better and priced similarly to a froofy Starbucks drink.

For dinner, their burgers are good, meatloaf linguini rocks, the crabcakes are phenom, and the hammerred pork is unbelievably ginormous and pretty good. The Kokimo sandwich was a little disappointing. Prices are fairly cheap.

TIP: get there before 9am on weekends to avoid a 30-45 minute wait. They take RSVPs 24hrs or more in advance Sun-Thursday. They are open 24/7!!! A great place to end a late night in Vegas..."
4970,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Really love this place. Get there early though, it gets busy quick. Priced right and really great food. We love it."
4971,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best food ever! Crab cakes Benedict is phenomenal! Chicken and waffles is delicious. We come here every time we are in Vegas!
4972,Hash House A Go Go,1,"After bragging the entire 6 hour drive to LV I was embarrassed when our food was delivered to our table.  The portions were very small (even though the pricing remains the same).  I had to ask for the strawberry preserves 3 times because the portion(s) brought to my table were less than a teaspoon each.  (In fact, the only thing that was the normal sized portion of HH was the biscuit).  Both mine and my guest's portions were quite small.  (I've gotten larger portions at Denny's for 1/3 the price).  Even the bacon was 1/3 the size of the portions in San Diego.  Someone definitely needs to reevaluate the HH at the Ling.  I think I'll stick to the San Diego location unless they too become skimpy.  After years of my family taking visitors to HH and raving I was very embarrassed since nothing but the biscuit was even HH standards and I had to beg for preserves for even that."
4973,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We went to Hash House bc we wanted some breakfast and since we are staying at the Linq it was right down stairs. We saw that the reviews were good and was excited about it. 

We got there around 10am and it was packed! We had to wait about 35 min to get seated. Our server was pretty good but once we put in our orders he was never to be seen again... We had been waiting for about an hour to which 3 families had already ate and gone and they had not arrived much earlier than us. We finally had enough when two groups of six received their food and they had arrived about 40 min later than us. 

HORRENDOUS service!!! Was starving wasted two hours of our first morning in Vegas. But went to Guy Fieri instead and it was amazing & great service."
4974,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm hard pressed to find anything negative to say about this fabulous restaurant. The portions are huge, the food is fantastic, and the service is on point. It has a great relaxed, casual vibe. Try the Indiana specialties. They're wonderful! I had biscuits and gravy on a bed of mashed potatoes and was stuffed. Love this restaurant."
4975,Hash House A Go Go,5,"AMAZING food! Had the griddled French toast, it was delicious! Big portions for a small price."
4976,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Enormous portions! Everything is fresh and  cooked to order which takes a while. That being said, our service was not great. We had to ask for water, twice. (And for refills) Our sever forgot to place our second order for drinks and we had to ask about them. By the time he delivered, we were ready to leave. Thankfully it's Vegas so we took our drinks to go. Next time we're starving in LV, we'll come back."
4977,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Was here for a heavy breakfast. My wife and I had to wait for 15-20 mins as the place seems very popular even on weekdays ! 

We ordered crispy potatoes for a side with the cafe mocha. The server was very courteous and took care of us. 

They had grunge music playing which complimented the ambience. 

Later, I ordered Andy's sage Benedict which was apparently featured on the tv show : Man vs Food. The portion aside is huuuuge!!

Took me almost an hour to almost finishing it, but had to regrets. The dish had bacon, fried chicken, sauces, biscuits and gravy accounting for an amazing concoction of flavors. The only thing I didn't like was the biscuit, which didn't seem as hot as the rest and was dry. 

Other than that, a great experience!!"
4978,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ginormous portions us an understatement. I ate an appetize, that was filling. My husband had breakfast for dinner. Easily all the dinner meals that we saw coming from the kitchen could be fir two or three people. 

It was a little loud fir my taste shock us the reason for the four stars, and our waiter forgot my drink refill. Other than that pretty good food."
4979,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Ugh came hear hungry as helll so I knew whatever I ate was going to be bomb but I left disappointed. 

First off me and my friend got the man vs food sage chicken ginormous meal. His meal came with a piece of brown paper bag that he chewed on, in the middle of his biscuit. (Where did that paper bag come from?! It could have been a wrapper to anything in the kitchen!)

The meal itself tasted alright. it tasted like a pile of breakfast items piled on top of each other. A lot of unnecessary carbs. Food network has failed me."
4980,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I have been here 3 times now. Every time my friend talks me into going, and as soon as I go to order I remember why I hate this place...

1.  It smells like cigarette smoke from the casino below.
2.  They play loud and lame music, on top of the overall din from tables being so close together.

They do no substitutions and no additions to their menu. Examples:
My boyfriend says, ""I do not eat pork, would I be able to switch the bacon for-"" the waitress cuts him off and says ""no substitutions!"" His meal came with bacon right on top.

My friend and I both order espressos, mine comes out great, his is watery and pale. He asks if he can get tea instead, and he'll just pay for both. The waiter isn't even apologetic at all that his coffee was made so poorly.  Just an ""oh sorry bout that, can I get you a new one?"" Would have gone a  LONG way.

I asked for the veggie hash with over medium eggs and Swiss cheese on top. The waitress tells me that I can not get cheese. I say, I can't add cheese to my meal? She says, well, you can get a side of shredded cheese. I ask her if my meal will be hot enough that if I place the cheese on top it might melt into it? She says yes. I say ok, I will do that. So the bus boy brings our meals to the table. My eggs are extremely runny and underdone. And the dish is actually cold so the cheesy does not melt at all. I wait for the waitress to come, 10 minutes after my friends start eating she walks by and I flag her down. I ask her if they could pop the skillet back on the stove for a few minutes so that my eggs could cook. She says no. But that if I really wanted they could make me a whole new one. (So basically wait another 15 minutes and then start eating when my friends will be ready to leave)

The waffles and biscuits look beautiful though. I just hate terrible service. And people who can't even be bothered to stick cheese on top of my scramble while it's hot enough to melt a bit.  The soup Nazzi thing isn't cute when it's a chain, that only works for mom and pop shops."
4981,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place has amazing food and HUGE orders. Make sure you come with your appetite. This is a must go to in Vegas
4982,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the place that I have been searching for all my life!!!! I wanted a place that offered a unique culinary experience and boy did we get it here!!! Service was impeccable; Steve was awesome and delivered great service. The wait was 40 min for our group of  9, but it was so darn worth the wait!!! I literally wanted to order everything on the menu; they're known for their hashes and Benedicts. 

Keep in mind that you aren't going to get the traditional Eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce.  Instead, they create their own special sauce and everything we ordered was delicious! We ordered:

Sage Chicken Benedict: Crispy Sage infused chicken on top of a mountain of carbs (2 grape size biscuits and mash potatoes) smothered in a creamy Chipotle sauce with sauteed spinach. One word: Heavenly. 

Meat Loaf Hash: Meat loaf was tender and well seasoned. Best part, you didn't overdose from the salt because there was barely any! 

Blueberry Pecan Pancakes are as gigantic as a large pizza and was crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. 

Sage Chicken & Bacon Waffles: This meal changed my life. I never understood the hype over Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles or the new Lays Chicken and waffles potatoes chips, but this dish seriously was the best ever!! The sage not only elevated the super juicy and tender chicken, but the fried leeks seriously took the dish to the top level. I wish they had chopped bacon bits throughout the waffle rather than just one strip, but their homemade maple syrup wasn't overly sweet, so the juxtaposition of sweet and salty was like an explosion in your mouth.  

We are definitely coming back here every time we're in Vegas."
4983,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing chicken and waffles!  This was our first visit to Hash House, 2 of us split the chicken and waffles and had plenty!  The servings are huge."
4984,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The best blueberry pancake I have ever eaten in my life, the blueberries were so fresh and sweet it was almost unbelievable. The portion sizes are huge there's no way a normal person eat a full plate from this place. Every time I'm in Vegas I will come here because I want to try everything on their menu!"
4985,Hash House A Go Go,2,"But why was my chicken pink? 

So I had some free time and decided to indulge in hash a go go. It was my first time at this location. As usual the portions were large! I order the chicken and waffles minus the bacon in my waffle. I think I waited to long to eat so I only had half of my meal so one breast and a waffle. I packed the other half to go. Hours later when I decided I wanted to revisit my chicken and waffles I open my box up only to discover my chicken was pink! I was immediately repulsed and threw it away. Sucks I really wanted the chicken and waffles but I wanted to skip the potential food poisoning. I suppose I will skip this location and stick with other locations."
4986,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We ate the Andy sage chicken Benedict. It was so good, that the two of us finished it, and we had energy to walk all the way to the Stratosphere. Let's just say that our tummy was still full by the time our feet fell off of our legs. It made me feel guilty, but after we spent some of that calories, I didn't feel bad thinking about going back there again, next time around. 

We didn't wait long, fifteen minutes max on a Tuesday morning at 11ish. 

We had mango iced tea and watermelon lemonade. Yummy."
4987,Hash House A Go Go,4,Good chicken and waffles. Long wait even for 2 seating. No complaints though as you'll often have this in Vegas at better places on the strip.
4988,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This was by far the best place we ate at during a weekend in Vegas. We wanted something other than Denny's or a buffet, so we hiked it up to The Linq where Hash House lives.

The place was PACKED. And I mean people in every nook and cranny waiting for a table. They told us it'd be an hour. Well we walked here from MGM so we said, fine we will wait. It was a bit chaotic and somewhat frustrating. Alas, they have a tiny bar, maybe 8-9 seats. We were watching it like a hawk, bam 2 people got up and we were on it like white on rice. So if you can get a seat there it's much better than waiting an hour.

The bartender was sweet and really great. They were obviously very busy but continued to talk to us. We both got mimosas which were definitely not shy on champagne. They were 8 bucks...not bad. 

My wife ordered the eggs with goat cheese, spinach, etc. It was delicious and of course a HUGE portion. I ordered the Sage Chicken Benedict...whoa! This thing was massive!!! It had a giant biscuit, maybe a whole chicken, bacon, tomato, mashed potatoes (lots and lots of mashed potatoes) and the most amazing chipotle sauce. That sauce was divine. There was no chance in hell I was finishing this. I didn't eat again until we got back to NJ around 1:30am and I still wasn't all that hungry. 

Overall, great service at the bar, fantastic flavorful food and decently priced drinks. The chaos of the line to get in is why I knock off a star, it was a mess. But that is mostly because of other people not the restaurant but I wish they had buzzers for people instead of slips of paper. When we come back to Vegas this will definitely be on the list of stops!"
4989,Hash House A Go Go,4,"5 stars for the food. 
3 stars for the service.
So I came out at an even 4.


Amazing breakfast is had here. 

I was really excited to eat somewhere other than Subway at Vegas this time around... and the Hash House a Go Go definitely provides a bang for your buck (which is critical when doing Vegas on a budget like I am).
But who am I kidding? I didn't even pay for this meal! A good friend did (and that right there IS the ultimate best way to do Vegas on a budget!). 

Got the HH Original Benedict but veggie style, so without the smoked bacon (got asparagus on the side instead).  The roasted red pepper cream it came with was absolutely Uh-mazing! As were the griddled mashed potatoes! 

Almost couldn't finish my meal, the plate was so large! Be prepared to get a to-go box and eat the rest after when you're good and drunk :)

The service was a bit on the slow side... but it was Vegas on a Saturday morning. A tip would be to come an hour before you actually want to eat and then go gamble downstairs while you wait for a table.
 
Also... i gotta say that the Entrance to the Imperial Palace from the strip is harder to find than one would think. There's some stores and a restaurant in the front that actually obstruct the casino entrance behind.  There seems to be only a vehicle entrance through two driveways, However, the actual pedestrian pathways are next to these driveways... they just looks like shady alley ways. Took us a second to figure it out!"
4990,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Parking sucks!! Looks like a delivery zone for trucks. You wonder if your in the right spot. BUT... It's worth a try cuz the service is good and the food is pretty darn tasty. VERY large portions, enough to feed 2."
4991,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My first time here and everything was amazing.  The wait was shorter than expected and everyone was happy and helpful.  The food...WOW.  It's good.  HUGE portions that NO ONE wants to finish unless they're crazy.  Be prepared to take some delicious food home.  

Their flare for quantity does not take anything from their quality either.  Each bite was delicious.  I got the chicken and waffle and could NOT, STOP, eating until it didn't wanna go down anymore.  It was just as fantastic the next day too.  

It was a long time coming in going here and I was NOT disappointed.  Thank you for a great experience Hash House.  I will be returning soon."
4992,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I wrote the owners of this place and no one answer me back so I guess they really don't care about the customer just their pockets so this is what I said....mind you NO ONE has responded back to me, apologized or refunded my money back! I was extremley sick from there food!

I was in Vegas from the 18th to 21st of July - I did some extensive research on the top places to each in Vegas and Hash House came up with rave reviews.  I didn't want to put a horrible review on yelp without telling you about my experience and hopefully you will make it right with me. My day of the visit was 7/19/2015 6:27 pm. First off it was so stuffy and hot in there it was unbearable; it was my friend's birthday and she wanted to eat here from the recommendations. I stayed for her purpose only or I would have walked out! Second your Vegan menu choices are the WORST I have ever seen! I had the portobello mushroom sandwich plain with the peppers on it.  I did tell our waitress that I was allergic to Dairy and I would appreciate if you let the cook know my food can not touch anything Dairy evidently that did not happen; I was so sick that it ruined the rest of my trip to Vegas.  I spent all night and all day Monday in bed sick as a dog! If I have anything Dairy I become extreme ill so I do let all servers no matter where I eat of my severity of my Allergy! 99% of all Restaurants & 9 times out 10 the manager comes out to speak to me about what they need to do for me! Evidently Tyffiney didn't take my request seriously!!  Very disappointed!! my friend said that her food was marginal at best."
4993,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The portions are huge, and that's coming from someone that can embarrass his wife with how much he can put down. Had the sage fried chicken Benedict and it exceeded my expectations.  Also had the BLT bloody Mary which was perfect after a long walk and nothing to eat in a while.  Wife had the pulled pork hash (forget the name) and we both like it a lot.

I want to keep coming back to overeat."
4994,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go, a place to train if you want to get into competitive eating!

My cousin and I decided to walk from our hotel to Hash House A Go Go. Since this place had a reputation of serving large portions, we had to build our appetites. It was about a twenty minute walk from Treasure Island in the triple digit heat of Vegas. No sauna suit needed!

When we arrived, the waiting area was packed! Those who were waiting for a table made use of the mini-bar by the host stand. The mini-bar served their famous bloody marys and screwdrivers, for a price. As I went to put my name down for a table, the wait was estimated for a thirty to forty-five minute wait. Since we were famished, we were lucky enough to find seating at the bar.

Once we sat at the bar our server/bar tender, Jeanette, assisted us. She took our drink orders and I chose to get a screwdriver. After placing our drink orders, we started browsing through our menus. Everything looked good on the menu, but due to stomach limitations, we ordered the following:

- Sage chicken and waffles that include, Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks

- Farm benedict with hammered crispy pork tenderloin with market yellow tomato, spinach, bbq cream and topped with scrambled eggs.

The screwdriver was pretty strong for my empty stomach and gave me a light buzz. As our food was brought to us, the medley of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", was playing in my head. These portions were ginormous! To make sure we experienced the best dining experience at Hash House A Go Go, we switched off on eating our dishes. The tenderloin and fried chicken were both crispy. The waffles with the fried chicken were kind of soggy due to the oil of the fried chicken. The gravy, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, and biscuits were a great blend of must have breakfast items.

These monstrosities destroyed our hunger pangs! The service from our server/bar tender Jeanette was great! My first time here was a great experience."
4995,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Two (late) nights in a row and loving everything we've had so far! Had the corned beef hash, made with pulled corned beef that's apparently cooked daily...one of the best hashes I've ever had! The flapjacks are huge and delicious as well, so bring an appetite!  The graveyard shift staff was very friendly, despite undoubtedly fielding tons of heavily inebriated hordes of LV zombies. A special shout out to Tyler who served my wife and I both nights, he was great to chat with and a very efficient bartender/server. A fellow Oregonian too! Thanks Tyler, we'll probably be back tonight and the next!"
4996,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Best breakfast, Brunch spot in Vegas. Learned about it thru the Yelp reviews and super glad we were able to check this spot out...Amazingly huge portions that the food lasted us for three days and don't worry about the wait once you get there. It sounds bad when they say like 45 minute or hour wait, don't run away from this place- you'll definitely regret that decision. Just head down to the slots for about 30 minutes and time will go by fast plus we headed back up there and an hour estimated wait time turned to 30 minutes quickly. Most of the people who had to wait probably went somewhere else- don't give up on this one!

I had the chicken and waffles..definitely lives up to its hype!"
4997,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I wrote a review and then could log into my account for whatever reason 4 it to post.  It been a week so some details are fuzzy. I was going to order something else and my server talked me into the sage chicken bend- omg!!! It's been a week ago tomorrow and I am wishing I had this right now.  Sage isn't really my thing, nor is chipotle- everything about it was delish! I did have it with poached eggs on the side cuz I am not a big scrambled fan either. Our server, young guy with a unique name, he steered us all in the right direction!"
4998,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Really have been dying to go here since late 2015 when I was dating someone who lived in San Diego. Never got to try it there so I made it a priority to try while in Vegas. Went twice. The first time we stopped in and the line to get a table was crazy long, so my friends and I went elsewhere. Then a few days later I stopped in on my own and got a seat at the bar since I was in a rush. Got their sage fried chicken & waffles, plus a kiwi-watermelon drink. Both were delicious! Couldn't finish the chicken & waffles so I took it to go & was able to save it as lunch for the following day. No regrets getting it, but I don't recommend someone with a tiny stomach to order it, unless they'll be sharing with the table or are able to take it to-go with them."
4999,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Words can't even explain the level of deliciousness this place offers. We went TWICE while in Vegas for the weekend. If you go after 1-2pm (which hello, its Vegas so it's not hard to do) there is hardly any wait and you can walk right in. I will definitely be back and dream about this food until I am there again. Haha!"
5000,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place for families. Great kid friendly service with fantastic pancakes, waffles (with bacon cooked inside waffle), and delicious fried chicken.

Note: Kids meals are even large enough share."
5001,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you are super hungry and on a budget, then this is the restaurant for you.  The portions are massive and you can easily split an entree with someone else if you aren't a big eater.  I opted for the Fried Chicken with salad, but did try the crab cakes benedict.  The food was average; it hit the spot because we were starving, but it wasn't anything special.  Just your average diner food with large portions at a reasonable price especially for Vegas.  I ended up finishing my salad that I had for dinner for lunch the next day and it was plenty.  Service was a bit lacking and there weren't much people in the restaurant at the time.  I assumed that the waiter gave us plenty of time to look at the menu (which was pretty extensive), but it took forever for us to get the check.  If I end up in Vegas again, I would come back for brunch."
5002,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The Rec and Food.
Andy Sage's Fried chicken is a mist. doesn't matter which you get, they are all great. 

Chicken was perfect. Crispy on the outside and moist thru out. Bacon mashed was creamy the way I liked it and Cheese scrambled eggs!

The Service.
Wait time to be seated 15mins. 
Server was great if we were curious anout an item id it was ordered in his area he'd run by with a quick flash.

Only issue i had was wait time for food but it is to be expected of a kitchen that doesn't use heat lamps or micros."
5003,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I understand the farmhouse feeling, but literally sticking a little tree right dab in the middle of the chicken and waffles was over the top! After I removed the miniature tree and tasted the chicken, there was still not much to like. The chicken taste like sage is the main ingredient. It's an overpowering sage flavor and smell in the worse way. The waffles are so thick and dense that it would take a lot of Butterworth's thick syrup to actually penetrate it. I saw this restaurant on the Food Network and figured I'd try it, but it really was undesirable in every way."
5004,Hash House A Go Go,2,"When I tried the San Diego Hash House a couple years ago, I fell in love. Portions were huge, the food was delicious, and the decor was tasteful. It was obviously a good place since there was a gigantic line. We did take out since the wait was so long, and the food came in PARTY PLATTERS. HUGE!

I read that there was a Hash House in Las Vegas, so of course, I had to try. Once again, we did take out because the wait was just too long. The food arrived promptly, but I was massively disappointed. The food was okay (JUST okay, not even good), and the portion sizes were not comparable. Somehow, it definitely missed the mark on the bar that the San Diego location set. We ordered the Indiana Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (somehow mushy) and the Famous Sausage Gravy Biscuits with Egg (extremely small). Also, it is worth noting that the inside of the restaurant, located on the second floor of the Quad Hotel and Casino, is a dump. I would NOT want to eat there.

TL;DR Go to the one in San Diego because the one at this location just isn't up to par."
5005,Hash House A Go Go,5,So much food! I would recommend sharing a plate. It's enough for two. It's a good sit down 24 hour place to go to if you're at the The Linq or near it.
5006,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Well it's called ""hash house"" for a reason. Unfortunately I ordered the cinnamon banana French toast and it was not the best. I was very disappointed however my friend ordered the corn beef hash and she said it was AMAZING !!!"
5007,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First time here& I got here about 9:30, about a 10 minute wait. The staff were definitely helpful with the menu, there was so much to choose from but my crew chose the most known items. The bacon waffle had bacon baked into it and was so delicious. The chicken& waffle plate was huge! But had such great flavor. The chicken was juicy and marinated in Rosemary, the sage chicken Benedict was my choice, honestly the best thing I've ever eaten. It's a lot of food. Mashed potatoes on the bottom, a layer of biscuits, tomato, bacon& sage fried chicken with a chipotle holladaise. Amazing!!!!! I couldn't finish it tho so beware."
5008,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Brunch was amazing. I had the famous Sage Chicken & Waffles.  The chicken was so flavorful,  and the waffles were crispy. I tried the smoked salmon Benedict which was also very yummy.  The wait was about 25 mins but soooo worth the wait.  The staff was very friendly and knowledge."
5009,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Ordered chorizo hash, biscuits n gravy, & bud in a bag. Soooo good! A lot of food for sure. Husband and I split and were stuffed! Quality A++!! Great service. Must go.
Okay, had to go back! Same great service!! Tried Sausage n Gravy Pot Pie & French Toast this time. Both were delicious! But I have to say, the French Toast is out of this world!!! 
If you are on the strip and go anywhere else for breakfast, you are totally missing out! 
The 3 best things; Price! Portions! Quality!!"
5010,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food is very good but portion size is very generous...Go with an empty tummy and don't fill up on the pre meal biscuit :-)
5011,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Our experience was not good.........
Don't get waffles because they will bring them out cold! This place is located in the Linz ; but I suggest you try some of the other restaurants near by.  There are numerous places to choose from."
5012,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Sage chicken and waffles! It was a surprise in every bite there was bacon in my waffles. I couldn't finish it all 4 waffles, 2 chicken breast. It was delicious"
5013,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Was a ""wow"" factor! Everyone in the restaurant was instagramming their food.  Great presentation, really couldn't eat all of it.  It was fun! Bringing the hubby back!"
5014,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I unfortunately stayed at IP, but was pleasantly surprised that House Hash was in this hotel. I went here for dinner and breakfast the next day. I was with a big party and was able to try a few dishes, so here I go.  

Rosemary Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict: My favorite dish on the menu. Yes, this is the one that was featured on Man vs Food.

Slow Cooked BBQ ribs:  Awesome sauce and meat fell off the bone. Horseradish coleslaw was tangy and spicy!

Butternut squash dish: Cooked to perfection!  Not soggy at all.

Chicken pot pie:  Great flaky shell and sauce used for chicken was delicious.

The food was delish, service always came quickly with a joke or a smile, and the portions are unbelievably HUGE!! Definitely a place where you can share a plate."
5015,Hash House A Go Go,5,"All the food come in big portion & it's so good, best breakfast I had by far in Vegas."
5016,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hash House a Go Go is up the escalator in the Imperial Palace Hotel.  It is actually a nice place to go to (surprisingly given all the renovation going on at the Imperial Palace).  We wanted a casual meal reasonable costs and Hash House A Go Go delivered. There were 3 in our party - one had  a hamburger; one had a salmon burger, and I had their chicken pecan salad.  I like pecans - and this salad delivered (almost to the point where I was almost ready to say no more - which is surprising for me).

The food is huge - my salad would easily serve a family of 4 - and as such, I did not finish it.  It was quite filling and prices were very reasonable.

If you want a casual meal which will fill you up, this place is a go to place.  If you want fine dining - its not; but for breakfast, lunch, or a casual dinner, the place delivers.

Service was good.  The piped in music is ok here - but a bit loud (we had one person with some hearing issues).  We still were able to have a conversation though.

Overall, good place to go for what it is - casual dining with huge portions with a reasonable cost in a very expensive dining area i.e. the Las Vegas strip."
5017,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy large portions! This place is delish. Come with an appetite but expect a wait time (we only waited 15 minutes but it's definitely packed). Crab cake sandwich was BOMB! And it comes with different aolis that are super good! 

Definitely a great place to eat!"
5018,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Tried this place out one morning due to the hype I found online, and it did not disappoint!
My mom and I ordered the fried chicken & waffles to share, and it was definitely a generous portion of food so if you don't eat a lot or if you're not that hungry, it would be better to share a dish. The chicken complimented the sweet waffle very well, which also had bacon cooked into it!
I also ordered their signature coffee, which was delicious but a bit steep for their price.
The waiter also asked us if we wanted whipped cream for our waffles, but didn't inform us that it would be an extra dollar on our tab, which I was a bit surprised about. However, our server was really attentive to us even though the restaurant was pretty busy. 
Overall, the presentation of the food, service, & taste was great. However, I do have to say one dish is a lot for one person and can easily be shared."
5019,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yum!! Heard about this place on the Food Network and had to try it. I was not disappointed.  We arrived around 11 and the place was crowded as expected and we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a party of 4. But 10 minutes later we were seated to my surprise. Every dish that went past us looked so good. We started with Bloody Marys and Mimosas which was good. Although the Blood Mary is very spicy so if you are sensitive to heavy pepper than this might not be the one for you.

I had the Indiana Favorites Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and eggs and it was as good as it looked. The mashed potatoes and biscuit were good and eggs were cooked perfect over medium. Huge portions are big enough to share or eat half and take the other half for later. My son had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and he said it was awesome. He doesn't normally eat spinach but he ate the spinach in this dish because the food was so good. This was the definitely the best meal we had this trip."
5020,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Holy cow. Where do I start?
First of all, I had never heard of this place, and my mom was adament about wanting to try this place because of all the awesome reviews she'd seen here on Yelp! I'm glad she insisted on it, because this place was yummmmm-o. 
Now, let me be frank, the parking at Emperial Palace is a pain in tukhus. At least it was on the night we came. The restaurant was also a little tricky to find inside the actual casino, but once we figured out where we were going, we were good to go. 
If there is one word I can use to describe the food here: hugemongous. But that's also leaving out how delicious it is. I ordered the meatloaf with BBQ sauce, and it was DIVINE. Seriously, I wanted to buy a gallon of it and take it home despite how hard it would have been to get it through airport security. I ordered like three extra serving cups of it. The meatloaf sandwich was rich and buttery, and served with a steak knife because it was so freakin' massive. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it or take it back to our hotel, so I had to leave about 1/2 to 2/3 of it on my plate. Sad. 
My mom ordered the Pacer's Hash, and it smelled awesome. Our friend Tiffany, who wasn't that hungry, thought it smart to just order a couple of sides, and chose the loaded cheese and bacon mashed potatoes and a side salad. WOAH. These things could hardly be considered sides. They were both the size of an entire meal. 
So if you're looking for some delicious food at a good price, Hash House is where you'll find it. 
And, you can burn some of those calories off by gambling downstairs when you're done.
... Wait... Maybe I've got that wrong. Oh well. Try it out!"
5021,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you want a breakfast that'll fill you up and keep you going for another fun day in Vegas, please visit Hash! 

I was a little skeptical coming into this place, but heard rave reviews from friends who are die hard fans. I don't regret going. 

The food portions are beyond belief for the price (especially in Vegas) and the breakfast booze keeps you coming for more. 

Visit this place when you're in Vegas, you won't regret it. It's worth the wait!"
5022,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My review #170! YAY! Okay, now getting to the review...

I'm actually giving 4 1/2 stars!!!

Man! This place IS GOOD!! They do give out big portions, like big enough for two meals in one plate.

There were three of us who came on a Thursday afternoon right around lunch time. The lady told me the wait would be about 35 mins. We only waited for about 16 mins. That was nice. 

We sat in a booth that was for six people, it was huge lol. Our server, Travis, was one of the coolest people there. He had his hair mo-hawk style, but it was so long lol. I seriously think he uses half a bottle of gel for it each time. Anyway, he recommended the tangerine juice, the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and one more item, but I forgot since we didn't order it. My friend and I ended up getting the tangerine juice, but it didn't taste fresh to us like it was supposed to be. It was still good though. It's close in taste with orange that's for sure. I ended up getting the House Smoked Salmon. It was delicious. However, I felt like there was too much bread and not enough salmon. Like they hid it under the sauce, so don't actually see how much salmon they give, but if you're like me and has to dissect everything, yeah...I shouldn't have this time. I only ate half of it there and took the rest to go. The fruits were good. My BF ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. It was huge! He only ate half and took the rest to go.

Travis was a really good server. One of the best I've had. He was informative, good vibe, no attitude, made us feel welcomed.

Overall, I would go again. But probably go @ the start of my trip rather than the end."
5023,Hash House A Go Go,3,food was so-so. service was great. had the chicken and biscuits and chicken and biscuits undercooked.
5024,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food tastes a little bland but the portions are HUGE! You can easily share the chicken and waffles with a friend and feel very full. It's a fun casual experience and the service was okay - got one of our orders wrong but was quick to fix.
5025,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food at the Hash House A-Go-Go is amazing. We were served by Kristin. She was attentive and was just plain fun.
5026,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place!  I go there for breakfast now every time I am in Vegas.  Beats any buffet.  Everything is fresh and delicious and HUGE!  all at reasonable prices.
5027,Hash House A Go Go,1,"First off let me start off by saying I made a Yelp account SPECIFICALLY for my dining experience here. 

After getting off of work with my boyfriend and his sister at around 3am, we decided we wanted breakfast and chose to go to hash house a go go. We knew the hype about it so we thought, why not?? 

Only my bf's sister and I ordered food and we got what was something we didn't expect. We ordered the same thing which was French toast with a caramelized banana on top with pecans and sliced oranges (wtf are the oranges for?), bacon, and eggs. 

What we thought would be delicious was actually unpleasant. The French toast was a little dry, the bacon wasn't crispy, and the eggs tasted like powdered eggs. But that wasn't the worst part. Literally after THE FIRST BITE WE TOOK, our waitress dropped our check and said,""I'm just going to drop this here. Don't worry, no rush."" WTF? We just got our food! What if I wanted a drink? Or dessert? We work in the food industry and dropping a check without asking if the food was okay, if we wanted drinks, dessert, etc., that's a big NO NO. We were there all of half and hour. That was rude as f***. 

The manager took care of us and was very nice about the whole situation. And the side biscuits and gravy that we got were the only delicious food item we ate. Eat there if you must but for me, it's a hash house a no no."
5028,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Can we say I'm in love! This breakfast spot inside of the link hotel on the strip is amazing! And everyone who is standing in the line knows it hence the 40 to 60 minute wait. We got lucky however and because we had a party of five ended up waiting five minutes which was not even enough for us to grab our BLT bloody Mary from the bar which was super tasty but admittedly kind of pricey at $20. Once seated, the service was fantastic and prompt. The serving size is ridiculously huge. Everything on the menu looks fantastic. I had the sausage gravy over biscuits and potatoes and it was super tasty with perfect thickness and not too salty. My husband had the snickers pancake and with that combination what's not to love?"
5029,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very good breakfast spot. Get there early or you may have to wait. They do get thru a large crowd quickly though, maybe why we felt a bit rushed during the meal. My wife's pancake was huge, decent flavor but a little chewy. I got the famous benedict and it was everything I hoped, very delicious. We probably should have shared that and just added some fruit or something."
5030,Hash House A Go Go,5,"One off my favorite spot in Vegas to eat. To bad that my bf is stubborn and afraid of food poisoning so we didn't eat there if not I will defiantly go back.

Anyways the menu change during the day which is cool but I think in my opinion the best menu is at midnight until morning.

The portion is big so you can be 2-3 people in one plate depends on what you order. Last time I order that was something with fried chicken and waffle.
Following time something with chicken and mash potatoes however the food is so big so I wasn't able to finish it.

But it's a place to go and eat the price isn't that bad to be on the strip

Defiantly coming back and to bad I don't remember the servers name he was amazing and made sure we was having a great time and got our food quick"
5031,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The only thing that sucks about this place is that they DON'T have a location in Boston!!  Lol!  I came here for vaca in March and we literally came here 3 times for breakfast!!  

They have out of this world BLT bloody mary's and yes it is exactly what you are picturing!  Bloody mary rimmed with crushed up bacon, garnished with a slice of lettuce, tomato, and a slice of bacon, with a piece of white toast on the side for dipping!  My thoughts exactly!!!  It even came out on its own plate!

We were pretty overwhelmed with the menu because we wanted EVERYTHING on it!  A friend and I decided to share some things so we could try a little of it all.  First up, the Snickers pancake, yes just one, but that is all you need as it is 12 inches wide!  It was heavenly delicious!  Second, we got the Fried Chicken and Waffles (which were infused with slices of bacon).  Heart attack on a plate, YES!  But well worth it!  Lastly, the Hash dish with grilled chicken, asparagus, and sundried tomatoes atop homestyle potatoes with 2 eggs, and a fresh biscuit!  A bit on the healthy side compared to everything else, but fresh and tasty none the less!  The marmalade that came with the biscuit made it.  

Definitely make this stop a must on your Vegas vacation!!"
5032,Hash House A Go Go,4,Open 24 hours makes this place special.  Large portion restaurants are all over the place but the food here is delicious.  A little self control and a box for leftovers is all that is needed to enjoy some Hash House.
5033,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Finally got a chance to come here on my most recent trip to Vegas. I had previously seen pictures of the huge portions & crazy plating & wanted to try it! This place is fun, & if you want a hearty, comfort food breakfast, this is your place. The only reason it was just so-so for me was that I am generally a light salad person, & with my special dairy free, low fat, vegetarian diet, it was hard to find something just right to eat. However, my friends all loved their dishes, & we all left uncomfortably stuffed.

We started with a vanilla waffle to share, which was perfect. Crisp on the outside, & just a hint of vanilla flavoring on the fluffy inside. I got the benedict which was eggs over a biscuit with a red pepper sauce (instead of hollandaise), and a side of mashed red grilled potatoes. All was good, but a bit heavy, & was really disappointed they left out my spinach! I also had a tangerine mimosa, because it is Vegas & I was a complete fish the entire trip. Their tangerine juice tasted suspiciously like regular orange juice, & was not of fishbowl proportions that I am used to back home at Bill's! My other friend ordered a strawberry margarita, but instead got some fruit slushee thing which wasn't good either so I would not recommend drinking here.

Two of my friends ordered sandwiches and they were good & stuffed with ingredients, & had nicely seasoned fries.

Overall, you have to try this place once, but I am not sure if I would return."
5034,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love this place! Have been to two locations here in NV, and one in CA. Giant portions of delicious brunch food. Coffee was a little burnt...but no place is perfect. Will be back the next time I am in the area."
5035,Hash House A Go Go,2,"i came here twice when i was in vegas, ehh i expected better, from all the rave i hear about this place. The presentation deceived me, i ordered the chicken and waffles, waffles had 2 strips on bacon inside which was tasty, but the chicken was just DRY. Ate a few bites and i was done. ill probably try something else on the menu if i ever come back."
5036,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing place to grab breakfast! Here are some hints: 

1. Call ahead the day before they take reservations just not on the day of

2. Monday morning around 9 am the wait for 2 people was 20/25 mins - not too bad! By 10:30 it was 45/60 mins 

3. The pancakes / waffles are HUGE and delicious :) 

My husband had the truckers special w/ a waffle which was very fresh and delicious. I had the basics and my favorite was the biscuit w/ coffee & iced tea and our total was $32

Highly recommend it - great food - was full all day!"
5037,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When people say they are really hungry and can eat a horse, I bring them here. Serving sizes are huge, you can easily split a plat, but I don't know if you want to. Everything I have had there has been amazing. Definitely don't leave the Hash House hungry."
5038,Hash House A Go Go,1,"If I had a choice I would not even give this place ONE star. We were seated for breakfast and the waitress took our order and she never returned to the table. After about 30-35 minutes I tracked her down and asked if she could at least bring some crackers because one of us was diabetic and we had no idea how much longer this wait would be for our food. She said she would look for something because they didn't have crackers. About 5 minutes later she came out with our food which was horrible. My eggs were supposed to be over medium but were so undercooked they still had the clear jiggly fluid (the whites of the egg). The potatoes tasted burnt, the toast was chewy, doughy. I would have asked them to remake it but we never saw the waitress again. Never asked how our food was, never refilled our drinks. When we were finally able to flag her down for the check, it was clear I did not eat my meal but she didn't even ask us how it was or offered to take the meal off the bill. Lesson learned, we will never go there again!"
5039,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Can you say HELLLLOOO HANG OVER FOOD! 

Hash House is inside Imperial Palace where I was staying for 3 days.  We had the pleasure of going twice.  The first day we had quite a long wait approximately an hour but once I received my food, I understood why.  The special that day was chicken and waffles and they were down to ONE waffle iron for the whole restaurant.  YIKES!

The setup of this place is pretty typical - nothing fancy but definitely clean and orderly.  The  portions are huge and the prices are surprisingly not a hard hit to your wallet.

First things first, Bloody Mary BLT.  It comes with toast, bacon, lettuce, tomato and deliciousness of a perfectly concocted Blood Mary drink.  It was a beautiful display and the BLT was a great appetizer to my hungry/angry aka ""hangry"" tummy.  

Like I said, this day the food was very slow and they brought out our dishes one at a time.  We had four at our table and the first person was finished eating by the time the fourth received their food.  I ordered the corned beef and eggs.  It was actually corned beef and not hash - SCORE!  Deliciously flavored and hot at arrival.  My boyfriend and our friend ordered the chicken and waffles.  I tried a bite reluctantly and lets just say I do not like the combo, however, the professional chicken and waffle consumers at my table had rave reviews.  Our friend finished his plate so they brought him a signed menu congratulating him.  It is a big feat to clean your plate so they have a fun way of recognizing the big eater! 

Our 2nd time going to HHAGG, there was no wait.  The service was a delightful woman who was fast and extremely polite.  I ordered the chorizo/eggs which was equally delicious as my first trip.  

Even if I do not stay at Imperial, Hash House will be a staple in my Vegas breakfasts for each trip!  Well done my friends, well done!"
5040,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went to the Hash House while on vacation in Vegas from AZ. My boyfriend and I each only had 1 waffle and while they were good, they were just too big to finish. We took the simple route but some of the plates we saw coming out to people looked really cool. Portions are huge and worth the money if you can eat it all....."
5041,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Definitely worth the wait for someone who's never eaten here before.  There's lots to choose from their eclectic menu and I really wanted to sample everything on it!  I ordered the chicken and waffles and theirs presentation is second to none!  Loved the bacon infused waffles and the chicken was the perfect amount of crispy!  I also ate half of the stuffed burger and that too was delicious!  No complaints on my end - only one suggestion...  They should have a picture menu of all their platters, their presentations are beautiful!"
5042,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Helaas geen booth maar wat een grote flapjack! 1 pannenkoek maar? Geen zorgen zei de serveerster, ze had gelijk, zo groot en zo lekker!"
5043,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It was alright. We shared the chicken and waffles. Maybe it just was too much seasoning for 3am, but we really weren't that into it. With the portions so huge, it seemed ridiculous for us to order something different, so we just went home a little hungry."
5044,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Even tho this place is always busy, I've never have had to wait more then 5 mins for a table! There food portions are huge!"
5045,Hash House A Go Go,5,Flight came in around midnight so I got situated and the first place I went was hash house. The Benedict is a favorite. I love the chicken.
5046,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great late night comfort food. Great portion size, would definitely recommend sharing. Service is always exceptional and good comes out fast and hot. I always look forward to my visits here. I usually never eat fried food, but their sage fried chicken is my once per year cheat. Love and respect for the manager, Brandon. Cheers!"
5047,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was super excited to try Hash House A Go Go. We had heard it was good for brunch and really good food. However we were turned off almost immediately. It is very difficult to find if you are just using a map app... we walked around for a good 20 mins before discovering it is inside the Quad, past some interior construction, and on the 2nd floor.

When we finally got up to the restaurant, there were people everywhere waiting to be seated. There was no rhyme or reason to the wait area and it was difficult to find the host/hostess station. We inquired as to the wait (we were not greeted or anything) and the host didn't even look up and told us 25-40 minutes. He did not inform us of any drink specials we could have enjoyed while we waited - although I did see a sign on our way down the escalator. The lack of acknowledgment and enthusiasm made our decision easy: to see food elsewhere. Perhaps I will try this spot on my next trip to Vegas."
5048,Hash House A Go Go,1,"2/27/2017 around 11am
Overall our experience wasn't that bad until one of the bus boy tripped and spilled food on my sister. Lucky the dishes didn't get to her head. 

NO Apologies!!! Ok no big deal no one got hurt and we understand they were busy. 

BUT one of the waitress came to us and told us rudely to move the bag. (First of all the bag wasn't in the way much and they told us it was ok to put there at first.. it's only small carry on bag) Not only that, she walked and told the other server that it was our fault!!! 

In the meanwhile, the other bus boy who cleaned up table next to us who did nothing wrong, he kept apologized to us. And continue asking if we were ok. 

I couldn't get all their name cuz we were in a rush to catch on the flight. But I can go back and identify all of them without any problem. I really hope they will take an action and do something with this!! I dare them to open the security camera and check what was happen. 

I got mad becuz what if my sister got hurt!!! Their plate is HUGE and VERY HEAVY!! 

Has that waitress even thought about this???!!? The bus boy who spilled water did not apologize once and the rude waitress who talked very rude to us."
5049,Hash House A Go Go,4,I have been here every time I come into Vegas. It's a great place. I only eat breakfast and have never had any lunch or dinner items. The portions are hearty even for a chubby boy like me. The wait can be long at times but it's worth it. I am giving only four stars because I got the cold brew coffee that was advertised in a pint but I got it in a glass. I am also suspicious about it being made a cold brew and not being brewed hot and then chilled but who knows. Overall great place and should be on everybody's list for breakfast while on the strip.
5050,Hash House A Go Go,5,When visiting Vegas this is a must! You have to stop in for brunch and there will most likely be a wait but so worth it! I never had such a fancy brunch before and I will be going back again when I visit Vegas soon. Love this place!
5051,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I am a huge fan of all things Hash House!
It's solid, dependable, go-to food in Vegas and with this location on the strip, it is now convenient!
The food, on a whole won't blow you're mind but it's darn good and there's lots of it. 
The only thing that rubbed me wrong about this location (vs the others) was the lack of natural light. The entire restaurant feels like it's up in an attic and there isn't a window to be seen. I have very mild claustrophobia so this made me mildly panicky.... 
Being in Vegas, I think they would do well to offer a Happy Hour menu, but that's just me."
5052,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ok.. the FOOD is actually a 4 star, but the service is a ONE STAR!!!!

Im giving a 3 stars because my bf is in love with their fried chicken benedict..

The place is hidden inside Imperial Palace 2nd floor...tucked in a weird corner, it's not easy to find...bad, bad, bad location!!

We were seated right away, but our waiter didn't come to take our order until 20-30 minutes later and about a dozen times of complaints and hand waiving from us. 

lots of waiters walked back and forth and passed our table..but we were just ignored bc apparently they were all not our waiter...

We were finally served for water after 20 minutes..and the food came in about 20 minutes after we ordered..so do the math..how long it takes  to dine there.

Food is HUGE in portion and overall has great flavor and uniqueness...prices are average at best for the portion size..."
5053,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Customer service gets 5 stars, food also gets 5. Cleanliness takes a star off. Their portions here are huge!!!! Huge enough to share so consider it!"
5054,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while since seeing it on the travel channel.  Opted to go to this location instead of the OG one cuz it was closer.  I wasn't expecting much cuz we all know how grand IP is!  But whata ya know, they had the whole top floor transformed and it was all about this restaurant!  That was cool!  Props to the designer!

We went a little crazy and ordered 3 entrees for the 2 of us!  Well I had to have the popular sage chic/waffles and I wanted eggs!  So we ordered the scrambled eggs jalapeno hash and turkey egg hash, along with the sage chic/waffles.  I gotta say the presentation of the sage plate was cool and the bacon in the waffles was a cool touch, but the waffles weren't as light and crispy the way I like them.  Anyway, we had a box of leftovers to take back to our room so that was fine.

Service was good and friendly.  

Cool spot to try but other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."
5055,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place has so much hype I don't even need to hype it up any more.. But it's GOOD! 
I had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was delicious.. Plus fed me for two meals! So even though some people complain about pricing, you could easily split a meal or eat your left overs later! My husband got the biscuits and gravy which also fed him for two meals. 
Obviously the only downfall is the wait. We waited for about 45 minutes but it wasn't a big deal because we just went downstairs and did a little gambling before coming back upstairs."
5056,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Everytime my husband and I come to Vegas we always share a breakfast at Hash House. And yes I said share because their portions could easily serve a family of four they are that big! No joke. We've tried something different everytime and have never been disappointed. They serve these amazing flakey, buttery biscuits with jam and literally it is so wonderful. My advice is come early otherwise you will have to wait (waits for a table can be quite lengthy at peak times) and come hungry!"
5057,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I went to the original location out on West Sahara. It should be a dinner place , not breakfast. The portions are huge, beyond that they are tasty and creative."
5058,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Man, MY idea of a BREAKFAST place............and WAY MORE!!

Bloody Mary's definitely and inspiration.  Full bar.  Waitresses add to atmosphere.  Several tats and just a little attitude.........but good service.  Food was ""monstrous"" in size and NO one at our table (two guys; two women) could finish their meals.  Good quality, too.

You can't miss with the Chicken Benedict or whatever it's called officially that was featured on Man v. Food.  I will post a pic.  

Get there early or make sure you have a line pass/Total Rewards Platinum or higher card as the line can go out the door.  Because it takes awhile for food to be prepared fresh AND it takes awhile for folks to eat THAT much food, I would make sure you saved enough time.  This is NOT a fast food experience by any means!  The one we visited was in the Quad....soon to be renamed Linq Hotel.  (A Ceasars/Harrah's property).  Located next to the new Linq development and the new High Roller.

5059,Hash House A Go Go,1,"So, the service was AWESOME except....They didn't offer me a brunch menu, so I had no idea I could have gotten delicious breakfast food this evening. 
The food, not so awesome. At all. 
I ordered a cobb salad with cucumber ranch dressing. It was huge, but not so flavorful. I kept looking for salty bacon and distinct red onion, and somehow, it was just bland. The tomatoes were good. *shrug*
The homemade biscuit was dense and insanely dry. Like, reminding us that we're in the middle of the desert and I'm desperately grasping the glass of water before my dried out throat shuts down on me.
I wrapped most of the salad up to go (not that death biscuit) because it's HUGE as the menu suggests, and took a slice of cheesecake to go, too. That was also enormous, and freaking flavorless. Well, not completely lacking flavor... It... It tastes like cream cheese brulee. Yeah. Almost burnt cream cheese. Not a hint of vanilla or sugar. Like maybe the cook got distracted and forgot that they didn't put anything but cream cheese and butter in it? I seriously would be better off getting a bagel and spreading this on it. Worst cheesecake I've ever tasted. 
I'm absolutely heart-broken."
5060,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Be prepared to wait both in line and at your table. Real veterans of HHAGG will know that and be prepared for the wait.

This place is immensely popular. It is located at the back of the casino in Imperial Palace. Just go up the escalator. The food is wonderfully prepared with huge portions of mouthwatering goodness. 

Stick to the breakfast items. You'll be glad you did. This is what they are known for and they do it well, but not very fast. They create their dishes fresh. They make everything in their own kitchen. 

Not only is the wait time long, but the kitchen is slow. They prepare everything fresh and they get easily backed up. Half the staff are veterans from other locations and the other half are newbies with little experience. The food is worth the wait. This location has only been open for about two months and the kitchen is not as fast as the Sahara location, this is why there are empty tables.

There is very little difference on the menu between the location on Sahara and this location. I've not been to the one in San Diego before. If you are not prepared for long wait times and slow service then you will be unhappy like all the negative reviews.

This location serves Pepsi not Coke, like almost everything on the strip. Just know ahead of time what you are getting yourself into so your expectations are met."
5061,Hash House A Go Go,1,"The BS that was here tonight is ridiculous. Due to our waitress not doing her job and having 5 of us waiting for god for almost an hour, when the manager DAMION is called to our table, he tells us this ""I'm not doing this, your meal is cancelled"" and WALKED AWAY. in confused as to how our food gets cancelled when your staff is the one that didn't do her job? Confused, Angry and STILL HUNGRY"
5062,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you haven't been here, it's a must hit!  First, I've eaten here many times.  Second, I'm less impressed with every visit.  The portions are massive, presentation is fantastic, drinks are awesome and the service is typically spot on.  It's been hit and miss my last few times, which is why I felt to give it three stars.  If you are a chicken and waffles fan, take that massive pile of love on and you won't regret it!"
5063,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Pretty good! The wait time wasn't bad for a Sunday morning, I expected a lot worse. It's a cool place overall. Our server Fonda was very pleasant and quick. The food was yummy, portions are ENORMOUS. I got the chorizo scramble and it's served in this massive cast iron skillet. It was good but the chorizo tasted a bit like chili which makes me wonder what was in it. My husband got the fried chicken benedict and this thing was a heart attack on a plate with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, bacon, cream gravy, eggs, etc. 

Overall - not too shabby for a local chain. I don't know if I'll be back but it wasn't bad by any means."
5064,Hash House A Go Go,2,"After eagerly anticipating this place, I was severely disappointing by the food.

On our way back home, we decided to stop by Hash House for a Sunday brunch. I already had eyed the menu online and had a good idea of what I wanted. I ordered the avocado, bacon, onion and cheese scramble (option #1 under Scrambles) per the suggestion of the waiter. 

When the dish arrived, the food was presented nicely on a huge plate. There was a generous serving of mashes potatoes, a biscuit and the scrambled eggs. The potatoes were very rich (read: full of cream and butter) and not hot at all. The biscuit was good but would've been better served warm. Now, the ""star"" of the plate - the eggs.

I hated the eggs with a passion. I took a few bites and I couldn't even any more. All I could taste was oil mixed with more butter mixed with cheese that was COLD. It wasn't seasoned at ALL and was basically a greasy puddle of room temperature oily eggs with bits of bacon. There was no texture in the eggs and it just tasted soggy and disgusting. *GROSS*

I paid way too much for a plate of oily, under seasoned food that was NOT EVEN WARM AT ALL.

+1 star for the zero wait time but maybe we should've just dealt with the long wait and gone to the Sahara location since I heard that place has better food."
5065,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have heard many great things about Hash House A Go Go and finally got the opportunity to check it out. All I can say is Yum...

Decisions, decisions, I ended up ordering the French Toast -Griddled French toast dipped in Banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup with a side of bacon to be exact. Large serving portion (I could have easily shared this with someone) Lots of wonderful flavor from the cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup, the whip cream made for the perfect topper.                   

You can call ahead to see what the wait times are but you have to go in person to put your name in. While we only had to wait about 35 minutes I have had many friends who have had to wait up to 3 hours for a table. This restaurant is very busy and the noise level is a bit loud. 

If your going on a weekend, I would recommend going before 10am to beat some of the crowds. Bring your appetite and plan on taking home left overs."
5066,Hash House A Go Go,3,"1+ hour wait. CRAZY!! So I went to the casino downstairs for a bit and lost $6 at the slots :(. And curse the casino server lady, she checked my ID (mind you I'm in my early mid-20s) and stole my unopened rasberry-rita. I was going to sip on that on the strip while it's my last day there. 

Other than that the food was great. The plating was great. 

The serving size was too great. Goodness, the waiter could have given us a little warning. Five scrawny Asian ladies with five different orders, each plate fit for a team of giants. So uncanny for Californian natives. Other than that, the food was awesome. We had the chicken pot pie, chicken and waffle, benedict, steak and eggs, and something with salmon.

If I was a vegas native I would have togo-ed all that wasted food. Why is there surprise mashed potatoe under the pot pie? We didn't need that. Next time I'm sharing 1 order with my girlfriends. 

The last thing we said to the waiter was, ""I swear we touched it."""
5067,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love Hash Hash A Go Go. Been there 3 times - basically whenever we are in Vegas.  Food is always yummy yummy, and portions huge.  We split 3 entrees for 4 of us.  What I want to comment on is the staff - they have to see all sorts of crazy yet are nice, upbeat, focused on service. That is so nice!  GO TO PLACE!"
5068,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hungry and Hungover in Vegas????  Hit the Hash House for rehab. 

Seriously, I never thought I would ever step foot inside the Imperial Palace but Hash House (and Fat Tuesdays) is probably the only thing it has going for it.  

Ok ok...so about the food.  So we stumbled on over to the Hash House to cure our hangover and see what all the hype is about.

Holy crap, there are no words to describe the portion size here.  I don't know what takes the cake here, that you can actually order a bud in a brown bag or the portion size of the meal.  

I had chicken pot pie and while some of the clientele in the casino below rendered me speechless, this for sure shut me up.  All I can say is it was big and it tasted soooo good.   Large chunks of chicken, flaky warm crust, fresh veggies...oh my.  

I honestly can't remembered what everyone else ordered.  My eyes never left my plate.  And the table was pretty damn quiet once all the food showed up.  

But what I do remember and know is that our waitress was the bomb, the food was well worth the price of admission and I can't wait to get back to the Hash House."
5069,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I made a reservation on Open Table for 7pm just in case it was crowded. The hostess was nice enough to seat my friends first before I arrived, since I was running late. My friends and I came separately and all of us got lost while trying to find the restaurant. I eventually found the escalator that led up to the restaurant after asking three different workers in the Linq Hotel.

With that being said, the staff was very accommodating and nice. The ambience was laid back. The booth was big enough to seat 6 people comfortably.

I didn't really look at the menu because I was set on getting the well known chicken and waffles. The portion was big enough to share between two people. The waffles have bacon in the middle, and the fried chicken was crispy and moist. 

I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends if they're ever craving some chicken and waffles. I'm glad it did not disappoint us."
5070,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great service, large portions, served fast, pretty good taste !! I ordered the blueberry pecan pancakes and tried the french toast too!! One of the diners and dives places and not very pricey!! Great way to start the day after a night in las vegas. All types of people come here to eat including celebs."
5071,Hash House A Go Go,4,"great place :) portions are huge, makes it worth your buck. before meal biscuits coated in the most savory glaze. all made fresh. loved it!"
5072,Hash House A Go Go,3,Bad service. Great bloody mary. Average food. Huge portions. Fun presentations. Great for a hangover!
5073,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was delicious but WAY too much. My husband and I shared a plate with a side of corned beef and there was so much left. 
The Andy's Sage thing was good but we didn't eat the mashed potatoes. Too many other good things to choose from. 
The Bloody Mary was great. 
The staff was all really friendly and professional. The portions being unrealistic made this meal a 4 instead of a 5 Star review."
5074,Hash House A Go Go,5,Delicious food. Portions are huge so it doesn't hurt to share. Had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Eggs. Excellent.
5075,Hash House A Go Go,4,Get the Eggs Benedict Florentine style or regret it for the rest of your life! It was insanely good.
5076,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I ordered Sage Chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry like the desert on the way to Vegas.  Im sure it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile.  I got my order within 7mins pretty fast huh but that just tells me all of it was pre-made and the taste showed.  The waffles did taste good though.  I asked for a large drink (oh yeah I had the order placed to go) so the soda was small and I asked the server if this was a large and she said ""thats all I have""  cup was so small I thought she wanted me to give her a urine sample.  With so many places to eat in Vegas I wont be going back"
5077,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I have eaten here twice.  Once in Feb 2015 for brunch - the place was PACKED!  We waited approx 1 hr for a table (party of 6) - I am told this is typical, and I can see why.  The service was fast.  The food was fantastic and beautifully presented.  Massive, massive portions though - my meal could have fed 3 people - literally.  Two of my friends had the fried chicken and waffles - they couldn't finish either.  

I ate here again on Wednesday December 23rd, 2015 at 8pm.  The place was empty - I mean, empty.  Not only was there no line up, there was probably only 8 or 10 tables seated in the entire restaurant.  The server told us that Dec 23rd is the slowest restaurant day of the entire year.  So - lucky for us!  Again, quick service, delicious food and beautifully presented.  Will come back to this place next time I visit Vegas."
5078,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ok so, the wait is horrible!!! Hence the four stars not five, also the server was kinda a @##hole I think he was trying to be funny but he failed horribly. Now on to the BEST part of this place the saving grace the food. I had the chicken and waffles of course, Chicken is the best fried chicken I've had! Moist breast full flavor breading sage just plain ole good. The Waffles, that I have had better, they were too dense and lacked something the bacon in them was great just wish the had more flavor. I think if they used the batter from Roscoe's with their chicken OMG that would be heaven. Price and Portion are also a plus you can get an entree and share. But when in Vegas why not be glutinous."
5079,Hash House A Go Go,2,"In my quest for a great chicken pot pie it was recommended to go to the Hash House A Go Go.  I went to the location at the LINQ in Las Vegas for an early dinner prior to a concert.  Our server cautioned us about the enormous portion size and guaranteed that I would not finish.  The open faced chicken pot pie shortly arrived with a huge pie crust, plentiful large cut vegetables and a tasty gravy.  What was missing?  The chicken - four small pieces of chicken.  The whole dinner was occupied with a search for chicken among the vegetables.   Disappointed, I proved the server correct by not finishing and have continued my quest for a great chicken pot pie that includes chicken.  My friend ordered the daily special of chicken and biscuits.  Instead of the pie crust, it has a lot of biscuits, plentiful vegetables and tasty gravy.  The problem remained - where was the chicken?  Beware of large portions that do not deliver."
5080,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm a brunch kind of dude. I just am. Brunching is one of my favorite things to do on any vacation and this place lets you brunch HARD.

Hash House a Go Go had been on my radar for awhile. My Wife and I had heard stories of it's charm, comforting, syrupy goodness and epic proportions and knew we would love it. It DID NOT disappoint. 

We were seated within 15 minutes at a table in the middle of the restaurant. This place is surprisingly big. We ordered the sage chicken and waffles to share along with some eggs and sausage. Honestly, the chicken and waffles alone are enough to split. The kids shared a giant blueberry pancake, bacon and eggs and some pretty amazing hot chocolate. 

So about that chicken and waffle plate.... Dear God it was amazing. Definitely the best chicken and waffles I've ever had and I've eaten them all over this country. We are talking a tower of bacon stuffed waffles, perfectly tender sage fried chicken Breasts (wing tip left in for presentation), a hot maple reduction sauce drizzled around the edges of the plate and fried leaks..  oh so many fried leaks along with little kernels of corn sprinkled throughout. It's served with maple syrup to create the perfect sweet and savory combo. Seriously. You need to try this.

The service was great and it was honestly one of my favorite brunch experiences. Can't recommend enough."
5081,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A burger lovers dream, delicious ranch dressing(not white but greenish as it contains cucumber), perfectly fried French fries. All plates are huge, French toast was good but they served the end of the loaf,bummer,they serve beer, mimosa had too much juice. All in all, I'm glad Adam Richman of man vs food recommended it, so do I. Enjoy."
5082,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I really didn't want to try this place since I read another review regarding other dishes, but my friend just woke up and missed brunch, so we headed over and I basically went to watch him eat since I was still full. 

He was deciding between the Sage Chicken & Waffles OR the Sage Chicken Benedict. The waiter said the chicken Benedict is most ordered and was also on Man vs Food. He ordered the Chicken Benedict and within minutes the monstrosity came out. It was an epic proportion and I can see why this was on Man vs Food. Our waiter told us all the plates were huge! (It is for 2-3 people to share!)

I'm not a big eggs Benedict person, so I wasn't very enthusiastic when my friend said he needed help. The layers of mashed potatoes, biscuits, bacon, eggs, fried chicken topped with cheese and chipotle sauce was messy, sloppy and did not look appetizing at all. 

I squeamishly tried to get some of everything at an angle. I started with mash potatoes and it was somewhat good. Much better than what I expected.  

For the portions and the price, it is worth it for the strip."
5083,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Our food arrived at our table 58 minutes after we were seated.

The waiter, a tall guy in his mid-to-late twenties with dark hair, was a total jerk. Our table of four waited 20 minutes for our drinks (basic orange juice, coffee, and water) to arrive without so much as a word. By this time, two tables around us had received their drinks and had ordered.

Me (as the waiter was setting down our drinks): Thank you. I think we're ready to order now.

Waiter (holds his hand up at me): I'm going to need you to give me a minute. 

He then turns on his heel without another word and walks to a group a couple of tables away (one that's had its drinks for a while) and takes their order. He then returns to our table without a word to take our order. 

We waited 38 minutes for our food to arrive. The food was fine, nothing special. 

There was another server, a tall girl with dark hair in a ponytail, that was super friendly to people near us. She had twice as many tables as our guy did and did her work with a smile. My only wish is that we'd been seated in her section.

I always tip 20% unless you've really pissed me off, and then I usually cave and leave 15%. Our waiter earned every cent of the 0% we left. I will not return."
5084,Hash House A Go Go,5,The chicken and waffles plate is sinful! I went there 3 times on my last Vegas visit which only lasted a few days but they have so many good stuff in the menu. I definitely gained about 5 pounds but it was worth it!
5085,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is our go to spot for Sunday brunch before heading home. We love the size of the portions at Hash House A Go Go and we love the taste of the food. I know that the line here is pretty crazy, but the wait is totally worth it and a diamond card really helps. 

Service can be a little slow at times. You can see all of the waiters and waitresses running around trying to accommodate everyone. But everyone that we have ever interacted with here is very friendly. 

I would highly recommend getting the banana flap jacks. The sage fried chicken and waffles is also another amazing dish. Oh and definitely try their fresh tangerine juice. 

Can't wait to visit Las Vegas again just so that I can have brunch here."
5086,Hash House A Go Go,4,This was my third time here and absolutely love the food. Giant portions are always great but can cause the quality of the food to suffer. This place doesn't have that problem. I wasn't impressed with tonight's service but remember having great service my other two visits. Over all this place is a must when in Vegas!
5087,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Almost all food on the Strip is overpriced.  In a relative sense, the food at Hash House A Go Go was not as overpriced as some of the other places.

The burger was one of the greasiest burgers I have ever eaten.   They even coat the outside of the bun with some sort of oil."
5088,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was absolutely amazing and large portions--definitely share! The wait is terrible so plan to spend some time in the waiting room, but it is honestly worth it. I had the roast chicken scramble with corn and peppers and it was DELICIOUS! My friend had a seasonal pancake that was the size of an end table--huge for a pancake! Must try if in Vegas!"
5089,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Found this breakfast jackpot while vacationing in Vegas and this is one place you need to hit while in town. We were seated right away. Everything we ordered was good, but the one thing that I have to talk about was their pancakes.  I'm not much of a pancake fan but this place convinced me that I should be. Their Banana Pancake was to die for and it was huge. If you like bananas, it had all that banana brown sugar goodness all up in it.  I'm telling you I've seen the light. I've gone to pancake heaven and back. I'm  giving my testimony. Come here hungry. Portions are supersized. Price is very reasonable. Excellent customer service. Highly recommend this place."
5090,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Their famous Apple Smoked Bacon and Mashed Potato burger is one of the best you will ever have the pleasure of putting in your mouth.  It has two patties with stuffing in between on a fresh bun with lettuce, tomato and red onions and is almost, I can't believe I'm saying this, too large of a portion for just one person.  Their coffee is one of a kind and comes in large glasses.  The price might look steep at first, but when you see the portions and taste the food, you will know it was worth it.

The worst thing about this restaurant is having to watch all of the people that ordered before you get their food and their large portions while you have to patiently salivate all over the table tops, waiting in anticipation.  The servers are encouraged to look however they want, and even our server with a 5 foot tall Mohawk, pulled it off nicely.  Whatever you do, don't give this place a try....give it several tries and be sure to add this as a ""must see"" every time you go to Vegas."
5091,Hash House A Go Go,4,"On one of our trips to Las Vegas, we drove directly to Hash House A Go Go on The Strip after picking up our rental car. Since it was Saturday, there was a 30 minute wait, which gave us plenty of time to review the menu and check out the photos on the wall. 

We heard the portions were enormous, bigger than your head, and we saw with our very own eyes as we were led to our table. After we were seated, we were ready to order once our server came over to introduce himself. We shared an order of Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict with extra chipotle cream on the side. When our mountain of food arrived (plated artfully with a sprig of rosemary...yes, there was a plate under there somewhere!), we dug into a delicious combination of fried chicken, bacon, tomato, spinach, mozzarella, scrambled eggs, buttery mashed potatoes and a moist fluffy biscuit, all smothered under a blanket of spicy chipotle cream. Sounds like a lot of food, right? Well, it most certainly was, because though we split the benedict, there was plenty of food left over! It was super busy, but the server came by to refill our water and check up on us. Nice guy! 

FYI, menu prices for The Strip location are slightly higher."
5092,Hash House A Go Go,5,We arrived on a Saturday morning around 10. The wait was an hour and 30 minutes for our party of 6 so we went to the bar for drinks and decided to order breakfast as well. The portions were HUGE. The chicken and waffles literally fed 3 people. I had a Bloody Mary-it was good but wasn't my favorite. Our bartender was sweet and very attentive! She engaged in short convos when she can and always made sure we were ok.
5093,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Go in knowing this is a dive, with higher aspirations.  They like putting a sprig of rosemary on everything, and they like to stack it high. 

I had the HH Bloody Mary, a good choice. For brunch I ordered a simple breakfast of bacon, eggs and French toast. I jumped right in to the French toast not knowing that the banana still had the peel face down, which isn't the best surprise when you're expecting a caramelized banana. That was enough to put me off up front. 

My hubs had the meatloaf sandwich. It's huge. Go hungry. He sort of liked it, but the bread was bland and spongy and the meatloaf was dry. 

Based on my first impression, it was okay. I went because a friend told me it was a ""Vegas thing."" It just wasn't my thing."
5094,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We visited about 2 weeks ago for breakfast . The place was packed, not a lot of waiting space,we took a few spots at the bar.  Service was very friendly at first, then I guess they loss interest . The food was a bit different then traditional breakfast food, some menu items included fried chicken,thats where the problem started.  The chicken was cold,and tasted a day  old,as a matter a fact,everything on the plate was cold we sent it back, the second attempt was not much better,still not enjoyable, needless to say they removed it from the bill,but the damaged was done.  Took forever to get a refill on coffee, even though it was at the bar,and there was always someone there pouring drinks."
5095,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This restaurant never disappoints me.  On my yearly to to Vegas, I always make sure to stop here. The staff is always cool and my God the portions are to die for!! Two people can share a plate! I would recommend not go starving cause you'll get full super fast.  Have a small snack so that your tummy can be prepared for food domination!"
5096,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Loved the food!  Order the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict - Man Vs. Food favorite - you will not be disappointed!  Portions are GIGANTIC.  The service was good.  However, the wait times to get a table are ridiculous on the weekends.  
I  would rate this as 5 - but, the Imperial Palace and restrooms need major updating."
5097,Hash House A Go Go,5,Open 24hrs we hit it twice dinner and breakfast it's at the quad awesome crazy amounts of food made fresh sooo good pictures to follow and it wasn't super busy on a Saturday night and the place is huge
5098,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is unbelievable with its giant sized portions! Food is excellent. Fried chic and waffles! Stuffed Mushroom burger!! I've never had anything bad here just great comfort food and HUGE portions to keep an army full!!!
5099,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Seriously the best brunch spot in Las Vegas! This is such a popular spot that you almost always have to wait 30+ minutes for a table, but it's so worth it :) 

My favorite item from here is the sage chicken and waffles. The waffles have BACON in them! And the chicken is just phenomenal! As you may have read from other reviews, these come in a HUGE portion. It's literally 3 meals for me, no joke! I've also tried the blueberry flapjack. The flapjack is the size of a pizza!! It tastes like just your ordinary pan cake, so nothing special there. Something else I've tried is their French toast. They should rename this ""French bricks"" because that's the size of these toasts!! I also love ordering the watermelon lemonade! So yummy! 

Overall, I LOVE dining at Hash House A Go Go :)"
5100,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We went here for brunch and let me just say Delicious my husband and I had the famous Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict and the banana flapjacks 
The meal fed both of us 
The flapjacks also fed both of us amazing Definitely going to keep coming back here every time I'm in Vegas 
I forgot the waitresses name but she did a outstanding job in customer service"
5101,Hash House A Go Go,4,"With so many reviews and so many people raving about this place, I just had to give it a try. I went with my wife and a friend for brunch on a Friday. We thought that the wait was going to be at least an hour judging by how many people were waiting but ended up being half an hour. The numbers were getting called pretty quickly. As for the food, we all seemed to enjoy what we ordered, though none of us were really impressed. I guessed we just expected to have our minds blown with all the reviews we've read. I'm a fan of corned beef hash and their version isn't the best I've had. My wife had the Tractor Combo and subbed pancakes for waffles. She liked it but wasn't impressed either. Decent food, decent sized portions. I saw the chicken and waffle plate and plates with pancakes and those were huge. I will say that customer service was awesome. Our waitress was friendly, patient, and was always there to top off our drinks and kept checking in to see if we needed anything. Overall pretty good experience. Is it worth the hype? Decide for yourselves!"
5102,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Pretty great food. I can see being a local, getting one meal here and taking home enough for at least one more meal. My pumpkin pancake was wonderful. It took up the entire plate. I ate about half of it. The chicken Benedict dish with the chipotle sauce was great, the sauce tasted bland at first then just a minor bit of heat followed and made it really nice. All the food was great. Service was hit and miss. Like any big place you have multiple workers coming to your table. We also saw other workers who were really personable. The server for our table was at times testy, maybe is the best word. At times he was really good, at other times he acted like he couldn't be bothered. All and all very glad we went here. 
My best advice? Bring lots of people and order 1/2 that number of meals."
5103,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Share share share! ""Your eyes are bigger than your stomach"" The portion size is huge and pretty pricy but that's Vegas for you. The wait for this place is about 45 minutes. 

Drunk and hungry and this place hits the spot. Although I felt disgusting and extremely full with a hint of heart burn after, the food is pretty good lol

Be patient though because the food takes a while to come out as well. Our server was polite and handle our table very well. 

The roasted chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus, Rosemary dish was good! It came with potatoes, eggs and a biscuit. Honestly, this place is really known for their fried chicken and waffles, so suggest getting that instead."
5104,Hash House A Go Go,5,"O. my. word. What a awesome place! We got there early, around 715am and had a 10-15 min wait. While we were waiting for our table larger groups arrived so we felt good about getting there early! The restaurant was nice, the service was great. The food...o my, the food was amazing! It was our last meal in vegas before we left and we did it up right at hash house! My husband had the chicken and waffles,amazing, he loves to eat so his meal was more than enough portion wise. I had a banana and brown sugar flapjack that was the size of the supermoon! I had 1/4 of it, along with eggs and bacon. The food was something to remember along with the experience!!"
5105,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're in Vegas and you're looking for a good meal at a great price (the portions are huge so you can and should share an entree), then look no further. 

We were staying at the Linq so naturally this was an easy choice for is since it's right in the hotel. 

I tried drinks, breakfast and dinner here (like I said, we were at this hotel). 

For breakfast I had the special which easily could have been shared. It brought eggs with veggies and machaca (traditionally a dried beef but in this case it was a well seasoned shredded beef), the house smashed potatoes or dried potatoes, fruit and a HUGE biscuit. I could not finish this so I ate only the eggs. The veggies were fresh and beef was good! I also had the pasta dish with the fried chicken.... To be honest it was way too much for me over two days Hahahaha. Great to split with 2 very hungry people or even 4 with another dish or appetizers. 

The drinks are a good deal as well, it's way better than what you'll get at the casino itself and were priced well in my opinion. 

I didn't even think of dessert. I'm thinking that us something you'll get by itself here. They are served to share among 4 ppl!"
5106,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great place for breakfast the are the champions of all the champions all the other breakfast spots are just runners up
5107,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh. My. Gosh. 

Go. Run. Push people. Just hurry! 

This place was AMAZING! I found it on Yelp and we went based on the reviews. Be prepared to wait about 45 minutes to an hour to be seated. In that time we went out to the Linq courtyard and got coffee so the time passed pretty quickly. 

I got the Fried Chicken Benedict with chipotle sauce. DAMN. It was a life changing experience. Mashed potatoes, biscuits, bacon, scrambled eggs, tomato, spinach, fried chicken, and cheese smothered in a creamy chipotle sauce. I just can't even explain the greatness that was this meal. 

The plates were huge! My husband and I should have shared but we didn't know how big the portions were. My husband got the Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles. It was good, not life changing. He ended up eating what I ordered after a few bites. We didn't even make a dent in our plates. We maybe ate half.. Maybe. 

Plates are on average $17. A little pricey but like I said, one plate is more than enough for 2 people and worth every penny!! 

We will totally be back!"
5108,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is a fun place to eat because the food is huge--bring your monster appetite and satiate it. 

I had the double stuffed hamburger patties with bacon, cheddar, and avocado on a bed of lettuce - huge and no skimping on the ingredients. I had a latte.

Hubby had the Scramble #1 with mashed potatoes and a biscuit with raspberry jelly. He was too full to finish the mashed potatoes and I helped him with the huge biscuit. He ordered the fresh tangerine juice which was over 6 bucks, but it sure was good.

The bill came to $43.55."
5109,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I'm sorry I don't know how this place has 4stars I get it it's a famous place. My wife and I decided to eat here hence we have ate here serval times at other locations but I have to say this location at the linq sucks it took us 17 min to even get acknowledged when we finally sat to get our drink orders then it took another 10 min to just get a cup of coffee. Which I never got a refill, Finally when we ordered our food give we have been sitting for 35 min at this point it took another 32min to get our food. Which was just a chicken Caesar salad. I wish I could give more stars but if you know your always this busy staff according to business"
5110,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We liked HH so much we went twice for breakfast and we were only there for two days.  Both times we got there around 10:30, and had less than a half hour wait for a table.  Neither time did we have someone telling us it would take half an hour for food once we ordered.

Of course we had to have the chicken and waffles.  For us, the star of the dish was the waffle - not too sweet, and being extra decadent with bits of bacon in the waffle mix.  It was great!  The chicken was good as well, but could have stood some more flavouring in the batter.  The chicken was nice and crispy, and I ordered the sauce on the side - for those of you who complained about the chicken being soggy, I'm guessing that might solve this issue.  I liked having the sauce on the side so I could dip as needed.

Other dishes we had was the farm scramble (so good, and love the biscuit) and the BBBLT (they are very serious about the back on this.  

Pricing was great for the Strip, and I've already told many others about this place."
5111,Hash House A Go Go,4,Very good breakfast here. Large portions and fun atmosphere. Amazing a place found a way to mix your breakfast food in a pile and make it look that presentable.
5112,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Went for dinner and the stuffed meatloaf was fabulous! 
The reason for only 3 stars was the return trip. Went back and started with the glazed bacon appetizer. 1 piece had super flavor, all the rest were blackened, with no flavor except burnt, and very dry. Was dissapointed to say the least. I did share with the manager, so hopefully it's improved, unless you like brittle blackened bacon.
Don't let this review sway you from not going, I would go again for a meal, but will definitely pass on this appetizer!"
5113,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Don't tell my husband I didn't give it five stars!!!!

HH was good. Well, it was ok. I had to act more in love with it than I really was because the husband was so hyped. When you're married to me you only have so much in life, so I let him have his moment. 

I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and he ordered the 1 lb burger stuffed with mashed potatoes and bacon. I heard the food portions were huge and I considered having us split an entree, but being on vacation we opted for being typical Americans instead. The food came out and it WAS huge. Stupidly huge. 

The pork tenderloin was the diameter of a dinner plate but the bun that it was set upon was normal size. Using the bun like a cookie cutter, I trimmed the excess pork so I could pick it up. The pork was awesome--just really big. 

Husbands burger was ok. It really didn't have any flavor and I was really turned off by the mashed potatoes in it. He loves mashed potatoes, so maybe that's why he thought it was so amazing. Eh. Mac n' cheese was good. 

Service started out great with an attentive waiter but by the end of the meal he had disappeared. I flagged someone down just as he reappeared and at that point his attitude had shifted. Odd. 

Would I eat here again? Only if I were to take someone who had never been here before. Other than that, it's just mediocre food."
5114,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Early Christmas eve morning, the last place I thought I would be is at the Imperial Palace, now called The Quad, or something like that.  Back in my college days at UNLV, this hotel was the after party, after the after party.  Remodel in progress, it actually looks great now.  Anyways, my lady and her baby girl wanted to eat here, thanks to ""Man vs Food.""   Needless to say, we were not disappointed.  Portions are huge and the presentations were beautiful.  Our jaws dropped when the plates hit the table!  The food was excellent.  We had the Sage Fried Chix and Bacon Waffles, House Smoked Salmon Benedict and a side of their Biscuits and Gravy.  Doggy bags are a must unless your into total gluttony and that's okay, it's Vegas.  Brandon, our waiter had his game down, as well.  He made our visit that much better!  Very contemporary, cool decor.  I will definitely visit this place again, but maybe the ""M"" or ""The Plaza"" locations."
5115,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Came here due to the good reviews, but was underwhelmed with the food and service. I got the crab ""Benedict"" while my husband got the corned beef hash. My eggs Benedict were just two over easy fried eggs, not poached like a Benedict should be. While the portions were huge, the food was just average. Service was also mediocre; the server only came around once and the table behind us complained to the manager about the service. For food and service, this place only gets 3 stars. 

I'm also deducting one star for shadiness. What really irked me was when paying the suggested tip- the print out receipt vs their handheld credit card machine showed two different amounts. I pointed out the discrepancy to the server and he indicated that management was aware, but indifferent. Overall, a disappointing experience."
5116,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The taxi drivers raved about this place.  The wait was over an hour and a half.  Needless to say, I was expecting great things.  I was less than pleased.  Good amount food for the price, since you get what seems like 10 pounds of food per plate, but everything we tried was blehhh."
5117,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I arrived at 11 a.m. on a Monday and was able to avoid the 15 minute wait by sitting at the bar.  The food is cooked to order so it takes a while to get served, but it was a pleasure to have a seat with a/c that was not in front of a slot machine.  The bartenders were great and the food (chicken pot pie) was very heavy.  I need to go nap now."
5118,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We went here for dinner late one night and it was awesome! The portions are HUGE! I loved the presentation of sandwiches with the Rosemary sticking out. I got the pork tenderloin sandwich thing with fries and hardly put a dent in it it was so large; delicious none the less. My boyfriend got a stuffed burger with bacon,avocado, and cheddar and his description= 5 stars. Reasonable, fun
Menu, good atmosphere. I'll always come here on Vegas trips."
5119,Hash House A Go Go,3,Large portion very large !! Kind  of a Denny's taste I like a lil more upscale but try it
5120,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food poisoning for both me and my partner. 

It was our first meal in Vegas after eating a bagel that morning for breakfast from our house. 

She got the fried chicken benedict and I got some kind of monsterous chicken sandwich. It was good going down but it ruined 2 days of traveling."
5121,Hash House A Go Go,4,"CAUTION! Serving sizes here are gigantic and can easily satisfy three people. 

Unless you've been drinking and have been preparing the whole day to take on the infamous chicken and waffles, like me. I've tried a few other dishes, but my favorite is definitely the chicken and bacon waffles. The fried chicken is incredibly crispy, well seasoned, ad blends perfectly with the waffles and syrup. Our waiter was also super cool and gave us extra syrup upon request. 

I also tried the fried green tomatoes and, to my surprise, they were fantastic as well. Unfortunately, they didn't give too many green tomatoes, which as so strange considering the portion sizes of all the other dishes were so huge."
5122,Hash House A Go Go,4,Portions are good. Chicken and waffles are so good! The giant pancake tasted like regular pancake but just big. You must taste the hot drinks!
5123,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Yes the portions are huge...every single review says that.  So let's talk about the other parts of the experience.  

~Service was not the best.  I understand it was crowded, but isn't it frequently crowded?

~Food was barely warm even though we were told the reason the food was late coming out of the kitchen was because the food was being cooked to order.  Ummmm, shouldn't all food be cooked to order?

~No refills on our drinks without us asking.  We had empty glasses several times and the waitress had to be told we needed refills.  

~For those of you wanting to try their regular Eggs Benedict, be aware that the dish comes SMOTHERED in a red sauce that tastes like tomato sauce.   Rest of the dish really had no flavor.

I am not impressed, will not ever return and if you want mediocre food and service after you wait an hour to get in...go."
5124,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was great.  Outrageous portions.  Over an hour wait for our food.  No apology for our wait.  We asked waitress after about 45 minutes, where our food was, her reply was it should've out soon."
5125,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House Banana Brown Sugar Pancake is the only breakfast food I will ever crave! Hash House was recommended to us and it did not disappoint! Huge Portions, big crowds and every plate that leaves the kitchen is beautifully constructed and is full flavor! We also ordered the sage fried chicken & waffles and enjoyed the flavor party in our mouth with the savory sage and fried leeks accompanied by the waffle with bacon and syrup! Our server was so excited about delivering the best food experience and she did! Love this place!"
5126,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge brunch crowd, little bit of a wait, but totally worth it.

This place is in the Imperial Palace which is under construction right now-- a little bit of a hassle to find... We were told that the wait would be about 30 min when we arrived on a Saturday morning, but I doubt it even took 20. This place is huge, and they put out a lot of food.

All I could think of while I was there was how much food this place must throw away every day. The portions are gigantic. Really out of control big. I was starving, and I doubt I ate 1/3 of what was on my plate.

I ordered the Fried Chicken w/ Bacon Mashed Potatoes, Biscuit and Eggs. My husband ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict. I liked mine a lot. He LOVED his. The bacon mashed potatoes were the standout for me. I thought they were excellent. The fried chicken was really good too-- it's fried with sage, and has a maple reduction. 

Waitress was very friendly and attentive.

We'd definitely go back. For the price and the amount of food you get, I'd say that this is one of the best values in Vegas."
5127,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Met a friend here for brunch this weekend.  She was having a rough day and wanted the blueberry pancake.  Who am I to argue?  The decor is basic diner and there was a pretty big crowd waiting.  They cranked through that line though!  We ran down to get a Starbuck's and it was already our turn when we got back.  Yea!  I got the meatloaf hash.  Good, but not nearly as good as the other orders at our table.  The pancake was huge and delicious.  The chicken and waffles (stuffed with bacon!) was amazing!  There were caramelized leeks and homemade bbq sauce on it.  Total surprise.  I was so happy there were leftovers!  I also love the homemade biscuits with strawberry jam and the tangerine juice option."
5128,Hash House A Go Go,4,The best food ever! Get fried chicken and waffles. Come hungry too. You will wait maybe a hour to eat. Don't be on a diet if you come here. Yum !!!!!
5129,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I was a little disappointed with Hash House a Go Go. The portions - yes, they are huge. But the food was just okay. I had the chicken and waffles and really, neither were spectacular. I guess the novelty is being able to get them (and a huge brunch menu) throughout the day. My friend had the pork sandwich, which was unexpectedly fried. Everything was warm and delivered quickly, but nothing seemed fantastic. It felt like the appeal is huge portions and fatty carbs (and I do love carbs), but the draw of large portions takes precedence over quality."
5130,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place is good. The food is delicious. The kid menu is very affordable and the portions are huge. I would have given it 5 stars but the fact that there is no bathroom is very inconvenient. The bathroom is located in the casino.
5131,Hash House A Go Go,1,I've gone to other locations and loved them but this location is horrible the food doesn't taste good and found multiple hairs in all our food DISGUSTING! Will never be back to this location staff even forgot about our table for 20 minutes and had to get a new waiter
5132,Hash House A Go Go,5,We came back to Hash House tonight.  It was amazing once again. We went to the one in the Linq hotel and casino (Las Vegas). The menu is not as big as the one on Sahara but the food is still great and hugh.
5133,Hash House A Go Go,5,"After such a horrible experience at Serendipity, me and my two friends stormed out of there and walked across the street to Hash House A Go Go. I'm really glad we found this place! 
Don't let the line intimidate you.. as soon as we walked up the escalator, there was a very large crowd. I walked up to the hostess in which she informed me it would be about a 30 minute wait, which was NOT BAD AT ALL compared to other great restaurants in Vegas. Unfortunately, they don't offer pagers or take your number down to text you and let you know your table is available. But we managed to go downstairs for some quick gambling and came back in 25 minutes to check up in our table. Not too long after, we were seated! Very prompt on timing!
After we sat down, our waitress came immediately and took our drink orders. When she returned, she had her pen ready to take our order and answer questions. She was able to give us great recommendations. The location was very busy so I expected a long wait time for our food.. WRONG! It came within 15 minutes and it was beyond what we expected. Definitely love the food and concept of it all. 
But what really got me to leave this review is the service. I was very shocked at how on point they are. Our waitress consistently came back and made sure we were good. My friend mentioned to me to ask our waitress for some jam and the waitress must have overheard because she brought it to us without even having to ask! BONUS. 
I wish there were more stars I can offer because she really did an amazing job and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Food was definitely cheap and affordable and comes in HUGE portions.. so make sure to come hungry or with a friend to share!"
5134,Hash House A Go Go,3,"As seen on Man Vs. Food... This pace is hype, so there is always a wait!

I was excited to give this pace a go but a little disappointed when we got our food... I ordered a pancake, yes it was bigger than my head, but the one pancake was pretty much my entire meal. They didn't have any breakfasts that featured their hugh cakes or french toast with eggs and hash browns or anything like that, which was what I was really looking forward to (a breakfast plate). You do get to select ONE side but when my plate came out I LITERALLY looked down to find one pancake and 6 tiny potato cubes, which I consumed in 1.5 bites. The potatoes were really good too! I'd rather have a couple regular sized pancakes and a generous portion of potatoes than a ridiculously oversized pancake with one bite of potato... I like more variety in my breakfast. I'm glad we came here because now I can say I've tried it but I can honestly say I'll never be back! There are too many better places to eat in Vegas!"
5135,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because our server Amanda was amazing!! My food was incredibly average. My eggs were cold, potatoes seemed like they had been sitting around and my added fruit cup was warm. Portions are huge so if you go be hungry. People seem to love this place. It was packed"
5136,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This should be a part of your Vegas trip, period. You may have to wait, you may not get your food super fast - but this place is the bomb. My food arrived hot, delicious, satisfying and that is all I could as for."
5137,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Originally I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but after I thought it over, it's at best 2.5 stars.  But since there is no 1/2 star, based on the experience, I rounded it down to 2. 

We had to wait for a good 15 minutes even though there were empty tables and despite I was told that we would be first on the list since I was a diamond card holder.  Their reason - to give the servers time to catch up.  Huh?

We were seated at a booth and it took awhile before our server finally came.  We ordered and then we waited, and waited, and waited!!!  Our server apologized twice for the delay of our food and took our drinks off the bill.  Even she didn't understand why the delay and said 'This is ridiculous!'.  

When we finally got the food.  Holy Jesus!  They were HUGE!!!  Had I known how much the food was going to be, we could have shared 1 entree!

I had the Sage Friend Chicken Salad with Mango Vinaigrette Dressing - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=RdfzlSuVWa3eLeZnlGumyw.  It was a WHOLE piece of friend chicken breast which didn't have much flavor at all.  I asked for some ranch dressing (all they had was cucumber ranch dressing) to dip the chicken with.  I quite like the Mango Vinaigrette Dressing but there was just so much food.  I kept eating and eating but there was still mounts of food.  I finally gave up and probably only ate 1/5 of the plate!  I think sometimes where the portion is so big, it actually ruins your appetite!

My fiance had a bacon burger - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=FcGwvwVxr1GdWl653lcnHA.  He said the patties were dry and didn't have much flavor, but fries were good.  

I also ordered a lemonade ice tea that was just bad!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=IC67vw3HBWwLHf2O0wadcA Stick with regular iced.  

I had a coupon (I know, I know, here I go with the coupon again) for $25, our bill was less than $27 (since the drinks were comp'ed).  I only had to pay less than $2 (exclude tips).  I gave her extra tips since she was nice enough to comp our drinks.

The only way I'd return is if I can eat free (or almost free like this).  With my own money, I'd rather go somewhere with better food!"
5138,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amaze balls. Had the eggs with avocado and bacon, phenomenal, not sure exactly what is was called but delicious. Great pricing too, expect to pay 13-20 for the main breakfast meals, well worth it. Most plates are big enough for two. Chicken waffles looked really good but so big so unless super hungry split it with someone. Great service too, really friendly staff. 
Kinda hard to find though"
5139,Hash House A Go Go,4,Walked in and it was pretty busy but I came solo so I was seated at the bar right away. And my food came pretty fast as well. I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was fried to perfection and the waffles had bacon inside! Only reason why I did not give it 5 stars was because I was expecting more flavor from the chicken.They give you a nice size serving that can be eaten from at least 2 times.  I would recommend this place to anyone.
5140,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great place to cure a hangover with their awesome tangerine mimosas and bloody Mary's. Hash House A Go Go at the Linq hotel is an awesome place to catch a good breakfast. I really enjoyed the bacon waffle and I had a taste of their World Famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Everything was tasty but just so you know, their servings are quite large so you might consider sharing. Service was great. Can't wait to go back."
5141,Hash House A Go Go,4,"In my three day trip to Vegas, I ate one slice of pizza and the fried chicken Benedict from Hash house A Go Go. This was plenty of food. 

 I've been to the Hash House A Go Go in San Diego (original, I think) and this place compares nicely. Huge portions and interesting combinations of things. 
I really enjoyed the bloody Mary, and I don't usually like Bloody Mary's.

What I did not like about this place was tha there was zero reception in the waiting area, and they won't seat you until your whole party is there. No reception, no seating till all is present, 20 minutes waits and Vegas are a bad combination with larger groups. 

Overall, its a nice mid-range priced place to eat. If you are not a big eater then the $2.50 split plate cost should be more than enough food."
5142,Hash House A Go Go,5,"After a night of partying, we came here for a late ""brunch"" around 2pm. I guess it wasn't that late because the place was still packed with people. We got seated fairly quickly surprisingly. I ordered the chorizo hash w/ cheese on the side and my friends got the famed fried chicken benne. I also got a freshly squeezed tangerine juice which was so fresh and refreshing. The food took a while to come out but our waitress was so attentive to our needs it made the time go by fast. The food was not too salty or overly flavorful and the portions are huge. Can't go wrong with the fried chicken benne."
5143,Hash House A Go Go,1,Couldn't sit us..very unhappy with the customer service here. I wouldn't recommend this place they're very mean to there customers who have been waiting for a long time..
5144,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I ate here again and it was just as great as the first time. 

The food is excellent and you won't be able to finish your meal. I had the bacon waffle (the bacon strips are cooked right into the waffle) and would recommend it.

I also tried the bloody mary and it was just right, not too spicy, not too salty.

Like I said in my last review, eat here and you won't be hungry until dinner."
5145,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Features:
-We ordered The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which came with two eggs, bacon mashed potatoes and biscuit.  Oh boy, this was so delicious!  This dish, like others, was huge and it MUST be shared because one person alone will not be able to finish it.  This dish was really creamy and juicy, and eyeing it at first glance made my mouth water before I took a bite, lol.
-We had the corned beef hash with red onions and swiss cheese which was great.  I am not a huge fan of corned beef but the cheese that came with the corned beef was really good and made this stand out amongst all the other corned beef hashes I've had.
-The sage fried chicken and waffles were good, the chicken really stood out and really is to die for.  I wish I knew how to make the chicken just as well.  The waffles were okay, it tasted like any other waffles I've had--really nothing special. 
-The kiwi watermelon lemonade was okay, the three different mixtures were intriguing and it made me really curious.  However, it was a bit too sour for me so put some sugar if you want it sweeter!

Improvement:
-We came during lunch time and the wait was super long!  They also don't take reservations so you have to go in person and put your name down.  We left and came back a few hours later and we finally got a table!  

Tips:
-Sage fried chicken was top notch!  Order it! 
-Come early to avoid long waits!"
5146,Hash House A Go Go,1,Horrible service. We went here for dinner and ordered a beer that was served in a large goblet. One of the cups had a very large spider in it when it was brought to our table. (See photos). There was no attempt to correct the mistake other than replacing the cup. We complained and the waiter did not take it seriously and kept brushing it off.
5147,Hash House A Go Go,3,The food was average and the service was fine. I was expecting better considering the line and the suggestions I was given to go. I might give it another try.
5148,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place.  Corn beef hash was awesome.  My girlfriend had the ""big quesadilla"" and the jalapeÃ±os were hot!   Get their early if you can because there was a big line when we left."
5149,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Been to the San Diego Hash House a few times already, so I knew what to expect when coming to this one, other than it being nestled in a Smokey Old Hote/Casino, but that pretty much describes every restaurants that's stuck on the Las Vegas Strip. 

A vey stark contrast in design from the very San Diego Hillcrest location, where there's an outdoor patio and warm earth tones and sometimes a DJ on the weekend, to a very cafeteria interior. 

Same items on the menu, breakfast is the way to go, when you go to Hash House A Go Go. I also recommend going when you are ready to inhale a huge portion and probably make this your meal of the day. These are generous portions. Since we were in town for meetings and a tradeshow, felt it was the safer route to just have the freshly squeezed tangerine juice, god bless Vitamin C, you know you'll need some when you're walking through the smokey casinos and doing a little imbibe during your time in Vegas. 

Went the ""healthy"" route with the farm scrambled with ground turkey, broccoli and mushroom along with their addictive crispy potatoes that are perfectly crunchy and charred. Oh but there's more, a homemade  biscuit is included with this meal. Suppose if you need the extra iron, there's a sage leaf that's included as a garnish that you could try to gnaw off on. 

A friend also got the frisbee sized pancakes, didnt try them, but he seemed to enjoy them and again did I mention frisbee sized?

We all did a good job with stuffing our bellys as much as we could. Service is decent, food comes out quick. On another day when you don't have any business meetings, etc I'd say get a cocktail, I've had them before and just a nice way to top off a soon to come food coma. 

Good alternative when you're sick of buffets and any other non descript restaurant that may be in your hotel for breakfast or brunch."
5150,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Nom Nom nom nom...sorry..had my mouth full there.  I am literally writing this review while eating here because it has impressed me that much!  While I didn't have to wait in a line to get in, after having eaten their food, I probably would wait at least an hour if not a little longer just to eat at this place again!!  It's THAT good!  We're talking about taking breakfast foods and leveling up.  If this were a supermario game, you would be eating that flower and finding the secret passage way to the higher levels...it's that good!  Oh man, did I tell you yet..it's that good?!  We had the meatloaf hash, the Andy's Sage chicken benedict, and the brown sugar banana pancakes!  Each one of them could've fed the three of us alone, but together represented a mountain of yummy deliciousness.  I don't know why ppl ever give this place less than 5 stars, but I've eaten at all types of breakfast places from diners, to trendy breakfast restaurants...none of them compare to what this place can offer.  I would highly highly highly recommend you come to this restaurant and give it a go.  I promise you that you won't be disappointed and that you'll get more than you bargained for.  For the 3.5 of us (2 women, 1 male, 1 baby) it was more than enough to even just eat one dish, but if you want to try variety, get at least two, and if you are leaving that day and will never come back, get three just to have some variety!  Ugh!  I probably would come back to vegas just for this place it's that good and I know you'll feel the same way!"
5151,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here a couple of weeks ago to try out the chicken and waffles.  We waited about 20 minutes and then were finally seated.  The waitress would not look me in the eye and instead only spoke to my boyfriend...weird.

And then when I asked her if a salad had spinach in it, she responded with ""are you seriously asking that?""  What??? How is that not a legitimate question when it didn't state it on the menu.  After that I decided to ignore her and enjoyed my meal.  I got a breakfast scramble and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles.  They were everything that everybody has said about them.....huge, delicious, crazy.

Right after we ate, we immediately had to take a nap.  So be prepared to go into a food coma if you come here and look out for mean waitresses!"
5152,Hash House A Go Go,3,"There was NO wait - maybe because it was lunch time but the service was sucky to say the least. The waiter had no name tag but he was easy to decipher as he had a HUGE MOHAWK. Our party of 6 waited 20 minutes for drinks, he was running around like a mad man from table to table ( I will say the table next to us kept ordering sides of mayonaise ? random!) The plate of Chicken with waffles was huge enough for 3 people to share and a side of mashed potatoes made this heavenly !! 
Later that weekend, we called back at 230am for a burger TO -GO and they refused to take the phone order and said we had to walk in and place it. It took 45 minutes to get it and it was just alright. I have been to the one in SD and had much better service and food at that location. I guess it comes with the tourist mecca territory."
5153,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A friend suggested we check this place out.  Based on what they told us, our mouths were watering. 

We arrived shortly after 9A and were seated within 15 minutes. (party of 6) We had an awesome waiter, by the name of Moses. He was very friendly and extremely patient with us as we bombarded him with assorted questions. He answered each one with a smile : ) 

I think any of the breakfast entrees could easily serve 2 maybe even 3.  However, being the gluttons we are, we each ordered our own entree so we could sample a little of everything. 

Hubby had the chicken and waffles, 2 large chicken breasts and 4 waffles. The only negative is that I prefer dark meat, but the chicken was moist.  I had the corn beef scramble, corn beef shredded on top of a bed of potatoes and topped with melted cheese along with 2 eggs and a biscuit. (YUMM.......) One friend decided to attempt the Man vs. Food creation, I think it was called Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. This one could have easily served 4! A bed of potatoes topped with biscuits, eggs, fried chicken, tomatoes and spinach (?) and then topped with a chipotle cream sauce. OMG!  Another friend ordered the Tractor Driver combo(?). I seem to recall sausage and eggs and french toast and a grilled banana and .........  By this point, I was so overwhelmed that I can't remember what the rest of the gang had.   

We showed pictures of our breakfasts to several friends and they told us they can't wait to check out the Hash House the next time they are in Vegas. 

Keep up the good cookin'!!!"
5154,Hash House A Go Go,4,We really enjoyed our breakfast at this location. We lucked out and got there before there was a long wait. It was fun because we were in a room where we could watch the national spelling bee and enjoyed our breakfast. The only bad part was was that our waiter spoke so fast it was hard to understand him and then the credit card machine kept failing and so he had to keep going back-and-forth and it just makes me nervous when my card has gone through machine and then it just stalls out.
5155,Hash House A Go Go,2,I am shocked that the service here is so bad now. I usually I have good service when I come here. We had to wait a few mins to be greeted and then it took a little while for the server to bring us our waters. The food was awesome of course and that's the main reason I came. The server didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. They just dropped off the check. Wow! It was also the slow point of the day.
5156,Hash House A Go Go,3,I was there this weekend and was surprised they charged me for Sriracha sauce! The waitress never mentioned it till I saw the charge on the bill. It's only 99cents. It's not the money but it is a condiment just like ketch up!
5157,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The only impressive aspect about Hash House was the portion size. The service is decent and the alcoholic beverages are good, but the food wasn't incredible. I went with a group of three and we got the Stacked Fried Green Tomatoes, Chicken and Waffles, and the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict. The portion sizes are huge so they can be shared between two people. The flavors were pretty basic (too Anglo/ Pleasantville for my taste) and I feel like you'd be better going to Park in DTLV for Chicken and Waffles. Overall it was a ""meh"" meal experience."
5158,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We stopped here before driving home from Vegas. My husband and I had both been wanting to try this place after hearing recommendations from friends. 

The wait was rather long for early Monday afternoon, over 30 minutes, but it comes with the territory of eating on the strip. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was the stifling heat in the restaurant. It was uncomfortably hot even during a cold day in February.

Our server was friendly, but he could have been more attentive to filling our coffee mugs. I guess we didn't look haggard or hung over enough.

My husband pointed to the vegetarian hash, and said, ""That sounds like you! Sun dried tomatoes and artichokes!"" So that's what I ordered, and I was so disappointed when the hash arrived with yucky raw tomatoes. The hash was underwhelming overall. The flavorful potatoes saved the dish. The biscuit on the side was ok.

My husband went for the biscuits and gravy as he always does. I know people talk a lot about the portion size at this place, but that dish is actually normal size. He liked it, but it wasn't as good as the restaurants back home.

I'm still sticking with the Egg and I as my favorite Vegas breakfast spot."
5159,Hash House A Go Go,5,Huge portions! Delicious food! We went Monday at ten and there was a twenty min wait.
5160,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I was here with my girl. I found out this place on yelp.
Saw the pictures of the foods pretty good. We got here.. there was a short wait. Service was nice and food was great. We very enjoyed it."
5161,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here for lunch a few days ago.  I got the famous one pound stuffed bacon cheeseburger with the side salad with cucumber dressing.  Burger was huge!!!! I shared it with my friend and we still didn't finish it.  It was pretty good, not dry and chewy. The cucumber dressing for the salad was nice and light, kind of like dill sauce.  I had some of my friends' Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles and it was magnificent! I love how they garnish their food with a huge strand of sage through everything. Definitely huge portions so the price is reasonable.  Can't wait to come back! They need one in Norcal."
5162,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Yes, the portions are as obscene as ever, which makes everyone laugh.  But, this Hash House experience was not as good as to our visit at the West-side location (6800 W Sahara Ave).  And, this location is kinda odd... basically a windowless attic in the Imperial Palace.  And, while the food was pretty good, it was inconsistent.  Worse, the service was definitely lacking.  I'd say overall 2.5 stars.

Service - 2 stars
The server had a nice demeanor, sort of Southern-friendly like, but his recall and follow-up were poor.  For instance, he totally forgot to order two of our drinks & one of our meals.  We also waited a VERY long time for everything... drinks, food, & check.

Chicken & Waffles - 2 stars
Good, but again not as good as the West-side location.  The waffles were not fully cooked (making them very heavy) and maple reduction sauce was too light to compensate.

Meatloaf Sandwich w/Cheese - 4 stars
A touch dry, but very tasty.  It came sandwiched between this crazy big bread (think Texas Toast on steroids.)  Fun to look at, but you couldn't taste much else but bread.  Flung the ""discus of bread"" onto another plate.  After that, the open-face style was much better.  

Stuffed Hamburger - 2 stars
Again, fun to see delivered.  But, the meat (two huge patties - like manhole covers) were pressed too thin, making them well-done & dried out.  Also, that burger meat quality was so-so (think basic McDonald's burger, but much bigger)

Big O' Roasted Butternut Squash - 4 stars
Unique dish... Squash stuffed with risotto and crowned with fried portabello mushroom and served with an ear of corn on the cobb.  But, it was huge carbo-load.  Two people could not finish it.

Overall, if you've never been HHAGG, it's fun to check out.  But, with all the uber-great restaurants in Vegas, we'll probably not return here."
5163,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Excellent Brunch in Vegas

You won't be leaving here hungry, the portions are massive. With prices ranging from $10-$20 you definitely get your moneys worth. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. While they don't have any omlettes on the menu (what I was planning to order) they more than made up for it with their scramble style plates. I had a avacado, onion, bacon, and swiss scramble which consisted of the aforementioned ingredients with approximately 4 eggs scrambled into a delicious cheesy egg mixture. This included a side of fried potatoes, fruit, and a delicious biscuit. Overall it really hit the spot and I didn't leave feeling terrible about myself. 

However, some of the other items people ordered were absolutely too big. A huge mount of eggs, cheese, meats, and gravy, over a biscuit... at least 2-3 times the size of the entree I ordered. While this was amazing it made me sick just thinking about eating it. So I would recommend ordering a smaller entree if you plan on moving the rest of the day. 

Overall, a great experience well deserving of the current 4 star status."
5164,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Had a very long line on a Sunday afternoon, but the wait wasn't bad at all. 

The food on the other hand was sub-par, and if I didn't know about the far superior location in SD I wouldnt consider going to another HHGG. 

The bacon waffle was tough and almost flavor-less, and the eggs served w it were cold. The meatloaf hash was alright; the large meatloaf chunks were pretty good, but still wasn't very impressed. 

Oh well, guess the poor quality of food at the Vegas location will make me appreciate the awesomeness of the SD food even more the next time I go!"
5165,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After getting so drunk at the Flamingo pool the day before, getting escorted out by security (nice guys btw), and then passing out the rest of the day, I was in need of some serious breakfast the next morning. After reading many positive reviews on this place, we have it a try and I'm so glad we did! The food came out in epic proportion! The servings were HUGE and tasted great (my opinion may be slightly swayed by the fact I hadn't eaten in almost 24 hrs but still). The service was excellent and the pricing fair for what we received. Great breakfast spot!"
5166,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here twice for breakfast while visiting in Vegas. I think if I lived anywhere nearby here I would be here daily. The food is fresh delicious and plentiful, how about a 17 inch diameter pancake about an inch thick, yes ridiculous but true. Decent prices good service excellent food and plenty of it, located in The LINQ Hotel make this a must-stop if you're in Vegas."
5167,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Service was a little slow which is understandable since they are so popular but it was still off putting.

The food was great! I ended up getting the maple chicken which was a very generous portion and every bite was delicious."
5168,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing! Had a 25 minute wait around 11 on a Monday, not too shabby! Fast and friendly service and for a breakfast food junkie like me, it was heaven. Huge portions and the biscuits are a gift from the gods."
5169,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Simply put this place sucks.

First it was a 40 minutes wait with no where to sit.  When we got called they made us stand in a over crowded area for another 10 minutes before taking us to a table.  

Food was not good.  The eggs are not farm fresh as they claim and the potatoes are meh.  I also was given tons of potatoes and no fruit like I asked.  Everyone else in my group thought their food was not that great.  

We couldn't even find our waitress to order ranch and she never filled our water or coffee.  We wanted more juice also but no one came by to even ask.  At one point I had to track down the waitress through someone else.  

Final straw is they charged 1.50 for the ranch we got at the end of our meal.  Really?

Don't come here, unless you want over priced ok food and even worse service :-("
5170,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I know you're starving and don't want to wait. Suck it up and go win some money while you do! I've been to the one outside of the strip so to find this gem in the Linq was a great surprise. It was about an hour wait for 2 (not bad for this restaurant) and I sent my boyfriend off to gamble while I waited. Staff was very friendly and while I was bummed we weren't in a super lively part of the restaurant, we didn't go there to socialize. I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and he ordered the BBBLT. My meal was SO amazing! Savory, creamy, crunchy, delicious. Huge portion that we both ate a lot of and I still managed to take home more than half of it. I didn't try his sandwich and although he said it was really good, he couldn't keep his fork out of my dish. I've had the pork tenderloin before too so I HIGHLY recommend it as well!"
5171,Hash House A Go Go,5,We've seen it in TV and couldn't wait to try it. So in June when we were in Vegas we didn't just go once. We had to go again before we left town. Damn the food was amazing. The place was clean and mice. The staff couldn't have been better. If we weren't half the country away we'd be back a lot more.
5172,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Chicken & Waffles!
Chicken and Waffles!
Need I say it one more time?
RUN here for the amazing Sage Chicken and Waffles. Located in Linq hotel towards end of casino! This place is dope! Great for couples and families. Food is flavored well, portions are big, service is cool and pricing is heavenly (surprised since in a hotel)

So my boy hit me up on FB since he realized we want in Vegas. Knowing I love food and love to try new things, he suggested we head over to Hash a GO Go! So Niki K and I decided to checkout the strip and the hash house made the list. The wait is CRAZY LONG but SOOOOOO WORTH IT!

We ordered two Sage Chicken and Waffles, 2 coffees and 1 orange juice. To start I normally throw down with the best of them, but I couldn't even finish this meal. Everything was phenomenal honestly. If we return to Vegas we might stay at Linq just to enjoy Hash House every other day!

So back to this wicked meal! The coffee was nice and strong! The OJ was freshly juiced and of course saved the best for last....
Sage Chicken and Waffles:
- presentation was stellar!
- portion was huge!
- waffles also had bits of bacon! Yes folks the waffles had chunks of bacon slices! Heavenly surprise.
- chicken was juicy and crispy. Best of both worlds! 
- chicken had a hint of sage that was very faint, so not herby overpowering!! Loved it!
- chicken was mainly a breast and had a tiny drumstick stick attached. Almost like a leg quarter, but not a leg quarter.

If in Vegas make this place a must visit folks. The food is to die for. As stated earlier, if we return to Vegas - the hash house will be on heavy rotation Holla! Enjoy folks!"
5173,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hard to top this for comfort food!  Had the chicken and waffles again, portions are over the top, flavor is wonderful and it's on my stop every time I'm in Vegas"
5174,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My friend and I split 2 dishes:
*Farm scramble with sundried tomato, basil, goat cheese + bread and griddled mashed potatoes 
*Griddled French Toast - bread dipped in banana/cinnamon cream with pecans and maple syrup

The omelette was decent but the mashed potatoes were AMAZING! I had them with the green pepper Tabasco sauce and the combination was delicious. The omelette was smaller than the portion of mashed potatoes so worked out for the best. 

The pecan-banana was satisfying to my sweet tooth - in fact, it was rich enough that I realized halfway through that I hadn't even added the maple syrup provided. 

Our server was great - he offered a suggestion when we asked, and checked up on us a couple times. A manager also came by to check in on us. 

I looked over some Yelp reviews where people mentioned ordering one dish for THREE to share which may be accurate for certain menu items, but definitely not ours. We left extremely full so the 2 dishes could have been split with 3 people total, but definitely not 3 people for EACH dish."
5175,Hash House A Go Go,5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! The BLT Bloody Mary was yummmo!! The serving sizes are massive and delicious! I had the Andys sage fried chicken and hubby had the pancake and this mocha coffee OMGGGGG!!! Loved every bite!
5176,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We ordered the chicken and waffles, meatloaf, chicken fried steak, and the shrimp appetizer. The food was decent and presentation of the food plating was awesome. The food also came quickly. The server on the other hand I did not like. She was an older blonde lady with short hair. She kept making comments about how we are ordering too much throughout our whole meal and acted annoyed about. I had a vochure given to me and wanted to use it all because we were leaving the next day. We also took one leftover dish home. I did not see why she needed to care about how much food we are ordering. However, her attitude changed completely after we tipped her tho."
5177,Hash House A Go Go,3,"You realize this place is iconic the minute you come up the escalator. The walls are filled with signatures and photos. 

We came here on a Monday evening. We were sat quickly at a table. 

I ordered an electric lemonade. It was ok. Nothing special. My sister ordered the chicken fried steak. I had a bite and it was really tough and dry. 
I ordered the crab sandwich! That was so yummy! My dad ordered a Cobb that didn't look like anything special. I will say though the display of the plates is cool!"
5178,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here for dinner and while I've been several Hash Houses, this experience disappointed me. Meal just wasn't memorable for me. Service was just alright too. Will return but definitely with lower expectations."
5179,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash house is amazing for breakfast. The menu offers everything and the food is delicious. While the Strip location is 24 hrs, breakfast is not offered 24 hrs... Which was very disappointing after finishing the Vegas half marathon, because the non-breakfast menu was limited in comparison."
5180,Hash House A Go Go,4,Man versus food! The food was good and service was quick. We would definitely come back for the chicken and biscuits!!
5181,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It doesn't matter you come in drag
It doesn't matter you come in stag
I'm telling everyone to get down here
Every taxi that you flag
Is going to a go go, everybody
Going to a go go
Don't you wanna go?

So they have a location in my hometown but I had to come to Vegas to finally try the place.

Servings are massive. But I had the basic breakfast with eggs, biscuit and fried potatoes. It was good but I thought the biscuit was sort of dry. Overall I thought the food was good.

My server was Jason. The guy is good. I watched him take care of his tables and everyone had a full cup of coffee during prime breakfast time.

Located in the Imperial Palace. There's a lot of construction so hopefully they will soon bulldoze this hotel."
5182,Hash House A Go Go,5,OMG you have never seen so much food! Amazing service great food! Try the chicken and waffles if you go in for breakfast and the blackened chicken Skillet if you go in for dinner the blackened chicken Skillet comes with these pumpkin mashed potatoes that are to die for!!! Might have to go back for dinner tonight! Ask for RJ if you sit at the bar best bartender in town! Tell him the Captain sent you
5183,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place fits right in with Vegas, all of the entrees are enormous. Many of the dishes are presented artistically. Two people can easily share a meal and have leftovers. 

Go early if you can. We got there at 11:30 and waited 30 minutes for a table on a Tuesday.

My husband ordered the truck driver combo with banana pancake. He did not like the sausage but the pancake was to die for. I ate 1/4 of it.  I had the eggs with basil, sundried tomato and goat cheese. Eggs were delish. I did not eat the potatoes because I thought they were too heavy and I nibbled on the biscuit which was not great. 

The service was great. Like other places in Vegas get ready to pay $6 fora glass of OJ."
5184,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent quality breakfast food! Try the corn beef hash skillet, Bloody Mary and their Snickers Pancake! Unbelievable. Be prepared to wait to be seated, because this place is not a secret. We also went to the Hash House at the Plaza Hotel. Just couldn't get enough"
5185,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This is good. You should come here when in Vegas. Sat at the bar/ counter. This place is a souped up version of the long standing diners that feed the working, drunk and unruly of Las Vegas. 
The biscuit was huge, the portion of the goat cheese, mushroom, and sun dried tomato scrambler I had was generous. The counter guy seemed swamped and a bit peeved when the wait staff asked him to do extra things or when I requested a copy of my receipt. Get him some help back there."
5186,Hash House A Go Go,2,"All show, no go! Great looking food, huge portions - but it all tastes off. From a little off to way off. The music was very loud (and we just saw Motley Crew the night before, so we like loud music) - just not excruciating loud rap music while one is eating breakfast. The waitress's comment when we asked that it might be turned down .... ""that's just how we roll"" sure let us know that we were not their top priority. 
And they charge to share a plate - that is absolutely disgusting. Great idea, poorly executed and horribly delivered. Oh - by the way ... probably the most expensive breakfast on the strip."
5187,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best breakfast I've ever had!! I absolutely would recommend Hash House A GoGo is a must to anyone looking for hangover breakfast cure!!
5188,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I came across Hash House A Go Go from their spotlight on the 702 TV show.  The television show spotlights local hot-spots, clubs, restaurants, etc.  The first time I saw them on television, the portions were huge (think Cheesecake Factory) and the food looked absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to visit the eatery until my next visit to Vegas.

My friend and fellow foodie were dead set on having Hash House for Sunday breakfast before he had to hit the road.  As we made our way to Imperial Palace, I was already drunk an it was only 10 or 11 in the morning.  After parking in the garage, we made our way into the casino and after asking some staff for directions, we made our way towards Hash House.

I was pleasantly surprise that there was no waiting time for our party of two.  After a few more shots, I glanced over the extensive menu and settled for my guilty pleasure of french toast.  My fried ordered some variation of eggs Benedict.  The food took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table and we were both with smiles.

The french toast arrive an were beautifully presented and resemble a presentation from the Food Network.  The french toast were dense, yet fluffy and were nicely griddled to a golden brown and dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  The french toast were mouth watering and undoubtedly the best tasting french toast I've ever had.  In addition to the fluffy toast, caramelized banana slices accompanied the delicious toast.

Hash House A Go Go is a food experience that will forever be embedded in my mind and taste buds.  My friend's breakfast was equally up to par and gave him an equally satisfying food coma.  If I had to compare Hash House A Go Go to something it would be The Cheesecake Factory, but more intimate and with a mom and pop diner feel.  Oh Hash House A Go Go, how I miss you."
5189,Hash House A Go Go,3,"the boyfriend had ONE place in mind for out first late night meal in vegas HASHHOUSEAGOGO the whole drive there my little-kid-at-heart bf was excited about the chicken & waffles we would be eatting later...

as soon as the rest of our group made it to vegas we hit imperial palace. after a walk down a shady alley & a maze of escalators we finally got to hash house!  too my boyfriends VERY VERY VERY severeeee disappointment the chicken & waffles was not served on the LATE menu because we were there at midnite :( omg what a SERIOUS bust for us...the boyfriend was PISSED to say the least....so we ordered him up an arrogant bastard to nurse &calm his dissapointment away...

i found the Indiana which was the closest thing for him...it came with sage fried chicken, eggs, potato & a relaly hard biscuit :) & i ordered a blueberry pecan flapjack so he & i could share.

the chicken was delicious no wonder the rave reviews and the flapjack was GINORMOUS and off-the- chain yummy!! the whole table could have shared and left full just off of that plate! loved it!

i also ordered their watermelon-kiwi drink because my friend Amy did & it was just beyond pretty...but its pretty much just....pretty...haha UNLESS you reallllly like sour stuff (which i obviously dont) after that drink my lips were permanently puckered for the rest of the nite!!

service is a win as well!"
5190,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I finally had the chance to eat here! Although a long wait (it's expected) and a long wait after ordering food (didn't expect it), the chicken and waffles were awesome and the kiwi watermelon lemonade was spectacular. I'll definitely come back but hopefully not with a very empty stomach. I was grumpy waiting for the food haha"
5191,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Every year we come to Vegas, we eat here at a minimum two times, if not three.  MUST for breakfast and always a late night fry/drink run.  The portions are ridiculously big, but equally big on flavor.  My mouth waters just thinking about coming here.  This year I had the crabcake benedict and couldn't have been happier!"
5192,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food and service. I ordered the pot pie. It was great, but it was a lot of food. One pot pie could feed a least 2 people."
5193,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Every time we go to vegas we have to stop there.  I love going becasue every time I go I try something new because the menu is so big.  The first time I ordered the grilled cheese it was amazing.  Then I ordered the chicken and waffles and it blew my mind.  The waffles had bacon strips baked inside.  The food is artistic  and delicilious.  I would make sure you stop there whenever you are in vegas.  Also, the portions are great so you really do not need to order an appeztier.  My goal is to go for breakfest because there is a different menu."
5194,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This review is for breakfast on a Sunday morning. We had a six and the quoted wait was 35 minutes and the were able to seat us in just about 25. The menu is mostly southern American cod fort food. The kids menu is a great value for the price, my son had a pancake and bacon and eggs and it was like 5.99. Some at the table had a blueberry pancake and it was huge. Personally I had the meatloaf and hash. The flavor spot on the peppers had just the right amount of sweet. The only problem is I wish it came with some sort of a gravy to help bind it all together. Overall it was a great experience and really good food I would definitely recommend this to anyone In Vegas."
5195,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing service and food options! 
This was my first time there we ordered chicken pot pie, chicken n waffles and home made cornbeef hash! Everything was seasoned amazing! 
My only issue I ordered a drank that was supposed to come with a souvenir glass and the waitress brings a regular glass put... I had to ask about the souvenir glass she just advised they don't have any. It would have been nice for her to offer something else. The experience was still awesome!"
5196,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Totally forgot to review Hash House A Go Go. This restaurant is A-MAZ-ING especially the infamous chicken and waffles. What drew us to this mouth watering place were: 

1) Adam Richman did the fried chicken eggs benedict challenge here (http://www.travelchannel.com/video/fried-chicken-eggs-benedict-12437) 
2) Highly rated on Yelp 
3) Recommended by a BM. All those factored combined, we HAD to trek our way over and taste it ourselves. 

The portions here are HUGE. You have been warned. We had 7 people and we shared two entrees and one side: 

Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle - One of THE best chicken and waffles I ever had. The chicken was moist, tender, packed full of juice and flavor while the waffle was drizzled with maple syrup and bacon BAKED inside! It was a good balance between sweet and savory. LOVE THIS DISH! As Jimmy McMillian says 'The Rent is Too Damn High', this dish is 'Too Damn Good""!! :) You will not go wrong with this staple meal. Just thinking about it makes my tummy grumble :(

Original Eggs Benedict - served with some fruits on the side. Tasty but not memorable. I would have gotten the Adam Richman's challenge! *drool*

Corn Beef Hash - with potatoes, scrabble eggs and swiss cheese. The potatoes were my fav in this dish, nom nom nom. 

This place is definitely worth a trip out to try if you're ever in Las Vegas. Oh, and it's now open 24 hours :O genius marketing/business strategy!! But just be warned, The Quad was doing renovations so it was like a maze to get to."
5197,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delish! Consider different locations- wait was long and under quoted. But if small party, try for the bar! Either way the food was worth it in the end! Fresh and looks higher end with a smaller price!"
5198,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious ,awesome I don't know what else to say lol. Great service....it was packed and wait time was 25 min but we only waited like 10. Bring your appetite!"
5199,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The food came in massive portions which is very clear by the pictures but, it was certainly quantity over quality. It was tasty it just wasn't you know...delicious. And, even though I left with enough leftovers to share with a family of four it just wasn't that great. I will say the service was awesome!"
5200,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have been dying to go back to this place since i was last in Vegas (3 years ago). This was our first meal in VEGAS. 

We shared the following 2 dishes for 3 people. 

Sage Fried Chicken: My go-to! I could not wait to be reunited with this dish again. I started at the top of the dish - working my way through the eggs and bacon mixed with potatoes and gravy. Eventually, I got to the fried chicken hidden among the AMAZINGNESS :) 

I remember it being a lot better last time. I think i overhyped it in my head. Chicken was bland. 

Corned Beef House Hash: I loved the combo of corned beef with the sliced potatoes. 

I preferred the Corn Beef Hash over the Sage Fried Chicken which was is surprising. Ask any of my friends - I love me some chicken. 

Cost: ~$50 with tip. Therefore, ~$17/person."
5201,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I waited in line for about 1 and a half hour to have brunch here because of all the good reviews on Yelp and the popularity of this place. However, the food is really mediocre and I don't think it is worth the wait, considering there are so many other options nearby. We ordered the popular items on the menu. The portions are huge, but the food tastes very dry and oily. Also it took about an hour to get our food after we placed the order."
5202,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My third time in Vegas and I finally had a chance to visit this little gem! Hash House a Go Go is located on the 2nd floor of theÂ LINQÂ hotel/Casino and it's known for large portions of food at a reasonable price.  

I made a reservation on Open Table because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. Linq hotel is on the strip and once you arrive, simply follow the sign for Hash House. Once you get off the escalator to the second floor the entrance is to the left. 

Upon arrival, I checked in to get my points for Open Table and to my surprise, it was only 1/3 full on a friday; we arrived around 845p. We were seated and immediately someone came over to take our beverage order and ask if we had any questions about the menu. Well, heck yes! The menu contained several pages for breakfast, brunch, dinner and cocktails as well as a menu for specials. So, my first question was, what are the most popular items on the menu? After pointing out several popular items like the sage fried chicken and waffles, the big o chicken pot pie and the hash house cobb salad, etc. I was even more confused. So, what you're saying is ""everything"" is good? Lol.  Hmm...so many options and only one stomach! Lol. The menu can be intimidating so I would suggest you think about what you want to eat prior to arrival (the restaurant has a website and the menu is available for review). 

You will be given a large complimentary biscuit with honey while you plan your attack. Lol. But be careful with the biscuit, it's so filling that if you eat to much it will spoil your appetite. 

My friend ordered the Famous HH Smores Mocha and Grilled the Salmon plate. You will need a spoon to eat/drink the Smores Mocha. It is served with a graham cracker and it has a thick layer of marshmallow on top with mocha underneath. My friend didnt finish it because it was too large but she loved it; she said it wasn't too sweet, it was just right. However, she didnt enjoy the salmon plate as much, but this was only because the carrots were served in large chunks and the mashed potatoes weren't mashed but a little undercooked. I ordered the brown sugar banana pancake and the warm spinach salad with grilled salmon.  Man, that pancake was more like a cake and the banana was so good, like they have carmelized it before adding it to the pancake batter. Much too large but absolutely fantastic! My grilled salmon was perfect! It was full of flavor and moist, not dry. The warm spinach salad was ok. The house made salad dressing is a type of vidalia vinegarette. Nothing special, but a solid dish.

Of course we didnt finish our meal (it was just too much food) but we enjoyed the experience. By the time we were ready to go, the restaurant was full with a 45 minute wait so I would suggest making a reservation to be safe. If you are in Vegas, dont miss this spot. You can thank me later!"
5203,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place probably wouldn't do so well if it weren't featured on Man vs. Food.

Right off the bat, the hostess was a RUDE a$$ bitch.  When we finally were seated at our table after about an hour's wait, the server just handed us our menu and asked us what our order was.  His attitude was short, rude, and unhelpful.  The music was playing way too loudly and we have to scream at eat other across the table to hear ourselves while servers and bus boys danced and fist pumped around the restaurant.

The Sage Fried Chicken was ok.  It was a HUGE brunch portion - enough for maybe 3 girls.  The food came out fast and fresh, but it didn't taste any more special than if we went to a normal breakfast place down the street and ordered the same thing.  The food presentation was nice, but all that food piled up on one huge plate might have just been astonishing..

The brown sugar banana pancakes were yummy, and again the portion was enormous! It could probably feed a family of 4 or a linebacker.  I've never tasted a pancake like this before so this is a must.  The chewy / crunchy caramelly rim of the pancake was just plain GOOD.

You're paying for a long wait, rude service, ok food, but if you're curious to see for yourself because you saw the episode on Man vs. food, then go right ahead.  Just don't expect to be wowed."
5204,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Our waiter, Flash, was horrible. He lives up to his nickname- disappearing in a flash and not coming back. But the food was fabulous. Huge pancakes and great portions."
5205,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Insane amount of food at a good price!  Sure it seems expensive, but you're essentially getting two meals for one price. I had the biscuits and gravy that had mashed potatoes buried in gravy and wasn't too sure how that could be pulled off, but all-in-all, it was pretty damn good. The wife had the maple chicken that was simply amazing. I heard it gets really crowded here, so get there early."
5206,Hash House A Go Go,1,Let me start off by saying our service was great. We came here because of the hype from those that have gone before us. We were not impressed with the soggy texture of the waffles in the chicken and waffle plate . The coffee tasted like acid water. We love strong coffee this was neither strong nor delicious. Will not be going back to try more items. It is like a glorified diner with ridiculous portions of dishes that are common to your hometown restaurants but with spices that you don't really care about.
5207,Hash House A Go Go,5,ok - Im not sure I can do justice to the place - simply put - Just get your butt in and find out. Its well worth the weight and go hungry and consider sharing entrees or making sure you have a refrigerator in your room. The portions are huge but not in a way that it feels commercially done. I went for the basic chicken and waffles - but the others in our group loved the meatloaf .
5208,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Very cool place. They have happy hour but you must support at the bar to obtain the discount. Our waiter was excellent. He was so patient with us as we were not that hungry and couldn't decide what to order. We came at 4:30 pm and dinner starts at 5:00 pm so no seafood. 
We wound up ordering the #5 burger mainly because it had avocados and a side salad with chicken added on. Love the salad. The butter lettuce was very good and they added a biscuit. The croutons were huge and soft. I'm used to them being hard so I am going to say honestly I wasn't used to it. The cucumber dressing was a perfect compliment to the butter lettuce. It doesn't overwhelm the salad.  It was divine. 

I wish I could say the same for the burger. Hubby and I had to spilt the burger and it was... Disappointing. It supposedly boats of freshness. Got that from the salad. The burger patties truly seemed like they were the frozen kind that you defrosted and cooked. It wasn't the worst but it was just okay. 
The waiter was a wonderful guy always making sure our water was full and checked to see if everything was good. If I could, if give this place 3 1/2 stars. 

It's ok for us but when in Vegas we're going to try other places."
5209,Hash House A Go Go,2,"A more appropriate name would be, Trash House A No No. I came on a Monday and it was packed, as expected. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait (for 2), which turned into 50 minutes. Once seated it took awhile for anybody to acknowledge us. Next, they ""ran out of clean glasses"" so we were served in plastic cups. Our food took 30 minutes to come out and our bill another 20 minutes after it was delivered to our table. The food was good, but nothing left a memorable impression, was worth the wait or the slow service."
5210,Hash House A Go Go,5,A hidden gem and quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had. I got the sage chicken and waffles and my girl go the brown sugar banana pancake with eggs and sausage. Everything was absolutely unreal and the portions were too big for one person to finish on their own. The bloody Mary's were also a hit. Will frequent every time I end up in Vegas.
5211,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge quantities, tasty food

The twisted burgers are gigantic and have great value for the portion of meat your getting, I had the mozzarella pepper and it was very good. The mashed potatoes quesadilla was very large and tasty as well.

This place is worth a try if your hungry and want a good affordable breakfast on the strip!"
5212,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I have an overall positive review, we really enjoyed the food and atmosphere! The portions and prices can't be beat! We had a very attentive server! We did have to wait about 45 minutes for a table on a Monday at 11am. Once we got seated, it took another 5-10 minutes before our server came over to take the drink order! The portions are HUGE!! We tried the tractor driver with maple banana pancakes (the pancakes are enormous!!!) and the fried chicken benny which is the house special and very delicious!!!"
5213,Hash House A Go Go,4,Better service this time around....more attentive staff even though it was busy. Great breakfast.
5214,Hash House A Go Go,4,YUMMY!!! I ordered a banana nut pancake on my first visit and chicken sandwich on my second. The food was soooo delicious and the portion sizes were HUGE! Definitely recommend. Price points were reasonable. Service was satisfactory. Highly recommended.
5215,Hash House A Go Go,5,Huge servings that taste really good after waiting an hour and having a Great bloody mary!   Worth it once or twice!
5216,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh my! I had no idea when I was on the hunt for brunch on the Vegas Strip that I would find this hidden gem. I say hidden because it's not visible from the strip but inside a casino and hotel on the top level. When I asked for directions, his eyes lit up and told me, if you only have to wait 40 minutes to be seated, then it's worth the wait. Needless to say, there was a long wait time but it was worth every minute I waited. Apparently, everyone knows about this place except for me and when I finally got seated and ordered my food, I completely understood why. First things first; customer service is good. You get a ticket when you check in and your name and tic number are called when it's time to be seated. I truly like this system because you're able to hear how soon your table is coming up. Their menu is expansive! It was really hard to make up my mind about what to order because everything looked and sounded amazing. I ordered a bacon and avocado scramble with fried potatoes and a homemade biscuit. When they brought the food out, I didn't want to touch it because it was so beautiful! I won't even mention that their portion sizes are gigantic! Anything you order really could be a shareable between two people. The biscuit was heaven sent. The meal...phenomenal! Let's just say that I'm going back again this week! I don't care...I don't care! This place will forever have a special place in my foodie heart. I heart Hash House"
5217,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Heard great things through yelp. Went on a Wednesday morning around 9:30, waited about 10 minutes. Very friendly staff at front desk, also greeted by Amanda, she was awesome 

Heard about the pancakes so I ordered the combo cake and 2 eggs and bacon breakfast, very good
Had a small problem with my eggs being cooked correctly, but Amanda quickly took care of it

Pancake was huge, but very good , not gooey and lots of blueberries, bacon perfect, and eggs were very good as well 

Nice portions, great staff and service....you should go!"
5218,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place was really good! Located in the Quad, the portion sizes were huge and the food was really good.  Our server was also attentive and helpful.  The chicken of the chicken and waffles was delicious.  I can't go the full 5 only because I found the waffles to be a little bland.  I was a little envious of the giant pancake at the table next to us. Overall, a ton of food for the price, especially by Vegas standards, and a fun menu for a place that focuses mostly on breakfast."
5219,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I use to love this place, now I just like it. They don't really cater to the pescatarian and or vegetarian lifestyle much. They do have a salmon breakfast, but it isn't that tasty. They don't carry any Italian Dressing and or Balsamic at all and only have the worst dressing like Ranch or Blue Cheese. Even the salads aren't totally healthy. I probably won't be back until they update the menu a bit for us clean eaters. As for the food I can eat...the pancakes are A-Plus and the my waiter/waitress are always nice. Now the hostesses, are another story. I know it's totally busy and their is dozen of people everywhere, so they aren't as friendly as they could be."
5220,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I bookmarked this restaurant a long time ago & was finally able to experience what all the hype was about, which let me tell you, I was super excited about in itself. The best thing about it was it did not disappoint one bit. As practically every other yelper has pointed out, the wait is inevitable, regardless of the time (mind you they're open 24 hours!), so if your dying of starvation and cannot wait more than 30 minutes go somewhere else. 

For our party we waited approximately about an hour during the brunch rush. To kill the time we went downstairs to the casino level and gambled until the time was eaten up. After being seated we were waited on within a few minutes. The staff is extremely friendly, they warn you about the big portions & fully break down the menu for what they're known for. We kinda went all out on the food because it was so affordable & experienced a major food coma but it was tots worth it! We ended up ordering the roast chicken & rosemary hash, chicken & waffles, & the fried chicken Indiana favorite that came with bacon mash & eggs. Talk about MAJOR portions, they're humungous & everything was either a WOW or mmmmm. Their chicken was so crispy on the outside but so moist & tender on the inside, to die for! The waffles were so fluffy & their maple reduction when you combine the chicken with the waffle is just a salty sweet perfect bite. The hash was beyond flavorful, it was like an explosion of rosemary & spices in your mouth also super delish!

Make it a point to visit here if you're looking for very affordable but extremely flavorful food. Expect the wait & go potty before sitting down, the bathroom is all the way down @ the casino level & it could seem like a mile if you really gotta go when you're at the table FYI lol."
5221,Hash House A Go Go,4,"servings are so big even for a plain breakfast of ham, eggs, bacon, and hash browns...

ordered Andy sage fried chicken benedict...wow the blend of cheese and scrambled eggs were to die for, the fried chicken was great, the skin so crispy and the chicken so juicy...the mashed potato was great too, don't like the location though, imperial palace just seems so dirty"
5222,Hash House A Go Go,4,"came here early morning around 7 or 8- no wait whatsoever! awesome!! had the sage fried chicken benedict- AMAZiNG!! huge (and i do mean HUGE) portions, flavor profile is OFF THE CHAIN, and originality was there 100000%!! the service was good- our server was super friendly and helpful.  The only downfall was the bathroom was not inside the restaurant (I had to go into the casino and look for one). other than that- no complaints! my meal fe dme like 4 times- no joke!"
5223,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Popped in for breakfast around 9:30.  Had a 20-30 minute wait but considering that the place was packed, I didn't think that was too bad.  Started off with a banana latte and it was AMAZING!  We ordered Chicken Florentine and the Chicken & Waffles.  Huge Portions!  The chicken and waffles was perfect.  I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day. The waffles had bacon inside of them!  Like big strip of real bacon! Mmmm Bacon! The Chicken Florentine was good, just not my style.  The biscuits on the Florentine were delicous and had it not been sitting next to bacon filled waffles, I'm sure I would have loved it more!  I will definitely be back."
5224,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I had some friends staying at the Imperial Palace -- my mom and I had enjoyed a day at the Caesar's Palace Spa and were hungry.  I talked up the Hash House.

This one is a far cry from the Sahara location.  The managers were unfriendly, and our server Jennifer was seemingly overwhelmed by too many tables.  My mom and I ordered a cobb salad (without the meat). I think it took 30 minutes to get it.  It was insane!  My mom was ready to walk out.  Needless to say, we ate the cobb salad because we were hungry, not because we thought it was any good. (Order the dressing on the side)."
5225,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This review is for 04/26, about 5:00 P. M!
We ordered Stuffed Meatloaf and Crab Cakes!
Wow! were huge! 
His Meatloaf was tender and My Crab Cakes were really good!
But the Mashed Potatoes underneath the my Crab cakes were soo good!
It had just right seasoning!
The best I ever had!
I wanted to it all!
They have Big Lime Margarita for only $9.99!
And it was pretty good!
Our waitress was really good and helpful and attentive!"
5226,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Whether you come here for breakfast or burgers, the food is great. We love the happy hour specials. From 3pm to 6pm, you can get buckets of food for $5. The best buckets are the candied bacon and the bucket o' pig (pork tenderloin.) With the tasty morsels, you can get $3 drinks. Sit at the bar and ask for RJ!"
5227,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for breakfast/brunch with my wife this past week - our wait was only ~15-20 minutes for a table, and we placed our order in pretty much immediately - the sage fried chicken & waffles and sage fried chicken benedict.

OMG - the proportions are ridiculously and almost obscenely ginormous. 

I think my wife (who almost usually always agrees with me heh heh) would agree with me that the chicken & waffles were more thoroughly enjoyable (from start to finish) than the benedict just because the benedict was quite a bit heavier. From the first bite, they both were delish, but the heaviness of the benedict/biscuit eventually wore me down. 

The waffles are AMAZING - seriously - bacon-stuffed waffles? why doesn't everybody do this? So good. And the fried leeks/green onion garnish that they use on the chicken & waffles - also wonderful.

would totally recommend anybody to come and try these 2 dishes - but if you're coming alone - just get the chicken & waffles!!!!! You're not going to regret it!"
5228,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg this place was AWESOME! The food was great and it was plenty. I was so fool but I was determined to finish every single bite on my entire plate. I wish I had taken pictures. I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes, bacon and fried eggs. It was delicious. Nashville needs a Hash House.."
5229,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First time trying HHAGG after hearing friends and family raving about it. Portions are definitely larger than life and all look and sound amazing. We ordered the HH Grilled Cheese which tasted more like a bacon BLT, minus the lettuce. We'd love to be back. 5 stars for atmosphere, staff friendliness and food quality. It took a long time from ordering to getting to us but I'm not about it knock that after the amazing flavors! Try the homemade biscuit and homemade strawberry preservative. Delicious!"
5230,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is delicious. The portions are huge and the service is great. They also have an amazing menu for the healthy and for the soul. Enjoy
5231,Hash House A Go Go,4,Definitely one of the few bright spots at the Linq. Their burgers are enormous and tasty. Definitely a great late night dinner option.
5232,Hash House A Go Go,4,This place is sooo bomb! I always come here when I'm in Vegas! You can't go wrong with this place the menu is huge!!! I always get Andy's sage fried chicken so good but also big portions you have to be ready to grub! The corned beef hash is also delicious!!!!
5233,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Good:
-food portions are ridiculously huge
-we were quoted 15-20 mins for 2 and got in within 10

Lame:
-service was awful. There were people that came in after us, ate, and left all during the time it took us to receive our food. We were not checked on until our meal was finished, which I noticed was common for the other tables within our servers section. A bus boy, Christian was superb and so kind when we asked him if we could get some more syrup and a water refill (hence the 2 stars).

Overall pretty disappointing."
5234,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Been to the place several times. First time my wife recommended we try it, I was surprised at the humongous size of the portions, and that was after she warned me! Prices are reasonable, too. Menu is somewhat limited but it is home style cooking and like my mom's cooking.....hit or miss. Never bad, sometimes great."
5235,Hash House A Go Go,2,Oh really? 4 stars? How? I ordered the sage chicken. It was dry... Rosco's in LA is so much better... or maybe I'm just spoiled by Rosco's... and Popeyes... Popeye's are better than dat piece of dry meat that I had on top of that mountain of bacon waffle.. which is pretty good... so next time. I would stay away from dat sage chicken and get that waffle at the side.. oh.. chicken pot pie sucked too.. Marie calendars would be better... sigh.. what a let down. We waited 2 hours for dat...
5236,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We had a lot of fun doing brunch here on a Sunday! BUT be prepared to wait! When we got there it was a 45 minute wait, sooooo we went to the bar and got an awesome Bloody Mary! Shortly after we got our table. I ordered the item that was on Man Vs. Food. It was HUGE and we totally could of shared but my boyfriend got the bacon infused waffle. Everything was great and ITS A LOT OF FOOD. Very filling. It was fun and worth the wait!"
5237,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing experience. We loved every bites of our foods. Our waiter was super nice too. We waited 40 minutes for our seats but it did worth it for sure. I will definitely go back to this restaurant and recommend it to everyone.
5238,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ridiculous portions. My wife and I shared and still took home a ton. Food is pretty good, but service is slow due to crowds and ambiance is not very classy."
5239,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Spent $60 on breakfast to eat in the middle of a Construction Site. They try to mask the sound by playing even louder music. 

I am sure it would have been great but I could not hear myself think. 

They should either have closed part of the restaurant down or postpone construction and do it on off hours. NOT at 8am when people are looking to eat breakfast."
5240,Hash House A Go Go,5,Breakfast definitely hit the spot here.  Delicious food in humongous portions abound here.  Come with a friend who has Dismond Total Reward Status to skip the line!  I had a Cappuccino to kick off my morning.  The Cappuccino was served with Nutmeg and Sugar Cubes.  I also had the Machacca Scramble with the Crispy Potatoes.  My party also ordered the Healthy Scramble as well as the Blueberry Pancake and the Banana Pancake.  Tara was our server.  She took good care of us!
5241,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Awesome breakfast.  We had sage fried chicken, very juicy and salmon hash, my wife's all time favourite breakfast.  Love having a drink with breakfast.  Must go hungry, very hungry."
5242,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food and excellent service!!! This place is a must-go for Las Vegas Breakfast.  Try the chorizo hash and of course the chicken and waffles.  There can be a wait but it's worth it.
5243,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food as always was great.  

Went there for Lunch after the convention, it was dead slow in there. 

Waitress took our order, but was kinda slow on getting back to us.  I had my burger brought out and asked for Mayo and sauce, she took 15 minutes, by the time she was back the burger was cold.   This is the first time anything like this has happened there, so I won't know the Stars, I just knock her memory. 

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, it's good for meal atleast once on your trip. 

D"
5244,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We always come here whenever we're in Vegas per a recommendation from my husband's Uncle. Their food is always fabulous and the service is impeccable! We've had several of their eggs benedict, including the fried chicken...sooooo yummy! And their fried chicken and waffles is absolutely amazing! The chicken is perfectly crisp yet stays moist and tender. And the waffles, believe it or not, actually have bacon strips INSIDE the waffles! I've never had anything like it and the syrup is scrumptious too! Though because it was so good we had to ask for more, but our server brought it to us promptly. The cheeseburgers are also absolutely amazing! Beware the portions are huge! My hubby and I always share something, and trust me he's a big eater!
And FYI, the bloodymary's there are really really good. They will of course ask if you want premium vodka, which costs about $3 more, but I say stick with the well and you'll be fine. It's not like you're going to have ten of them anyway (or will you?). 
I can't say enough great things about this restaurant, we have always had great food and great service no matter what time of day or night. We will always visit this place once or twice every time we're in Vegas...we're just waiting for them to open up here in the bay area....course that wouldn't be very good for my hips, but who cares???"
5245,Hash House A Go Go,1,"fucked up my breakfast experience.. bad service slow service, others came after us and ate and finished before I got my meal. see photo of how bad the potatoes came out. should have went to Denny's. only good thing was got seating asap but the wait.. wdh  way over rated. maybe I'm suppose to get the popular dish but why is the simple breakfast meal so crappy ?"
5246,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The wait was long on a Saturday morning but it was well worth it! I tried chicken and waffles, the waffles was little dry but the chicken breast was well seasoned. My friend had the a egg scrambler and she said it was AMAZING!!! Overall great experience!!"
5247,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Giving this place a one star is being NICE! If I was able to give this a negative star i definitely would! From the moment we put our name on the wait list I should have known we were going to have a TERRIBLE experience. We were told the wait time was 45min to a hour, which obliviously  we knew that was to be expected since was being a busy Monday. We decided to wait at the bottom of the escalator because the waiting area was packed with people. We went back up 10 mins after to see if there was somewhere to sit in the waiting area. 30mins later they still haven't called our names, so we ask to see where our names was on the list. The hostess tells us they called our name long before and gave our table away and now we had to wait for another table. Strike one

Finally they seat us far in one of the back rooms. It was 1:20pm to be extact. Right when they sat us down, they try and rush to take our order, which irritated me to the max  because how could we possibly order when 1. We weren't even asked for a drink order, and 2. HOW COULD WE WHEN WE HAVEN'T EVEN OPEN OUR MENUS YET.
Strike two!

It was now 2:15pm and we still don't  have ANY FOOD. Our server Melissa,  which by the way coming from working in restaurant as a chef for over 10 years was JUST THE WORSE! She noticed  how upset we were because we still have no food, first thing she says was "" hey, I put the order in at 1:40 I don't know why it's taking so long"" she still has not asked us if we needed any refills or anything! Mind you we all had the first drink from when we first sat down. She comes to notify us our is ready just waiting on one plate and they cannot take out any food unless every plate is up. So She comes back with only one out of 7 plates. 5 minutes after   the other 6 plates still have not come out! What happened with their policy "" We can't take food out  unless everything was up "". Finally it's 230 and we finally get to eat, after being sat at a table for ONE HOUR. Then what happens, she messed up on two orders and my mom potatoes were cold. So it's pretty clear she forgot to put our food order in and was not taking the blame for it. Coming for a culinary background, the food was awful. Lack  SALT and seasoning! Their garnishes made absolutely ZERO sense, fried pasta noodles underneath the main entree?? What's the point there. At this point, I asked to speak to a manager, even the 1st time he came around concerning the cold potatoes he was useless! 
After finishing our TERRIBLE food, we found ourselves waiting AGAIN for a check! It took almost 30 MINUTES to get a check. We decided to walk to the front in hopes to get SOMEONE'S attention, we were then stopped by the hostess whom was very rude, she tells us our server was ""discounting our check"" Really??30 minutes to discount our check! And of course what did they add. GRATUITY. At that point I was so beyond pissed  I just wanted to get out of there! 
STRIKE THREE!

This place is ALL A HYPE, I  hate to  use my chef card, but after getting excuse, after excuse , this place is awful. Especially  the excuse our server have us when we were upset "" I didn't want to bother you guys because you guys looked really upset "" 
Melissa if you're reading this  PLEASE quit serving and look into a different line of work!"
5248,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Big portions, great food, crowded as all get out.

Tip:  Get a Total Rewards Platinum Card and skip the line...also thumb your nose at the people in the long line as you pass on through as though you are Thurston Howell playing through at the Pebble Beach Golf Course.

Get the Fried Chicken Benedict or the Chicken and Waffles.  The Benedict is a lot of freakin food, and gets cold quick if you don't hoover it.  The Chicken and Waffles seems to hold together fairly well.  Don't think this is a classy joint...because it isn't.  This is a spit on the floor and curse at your friends kind of place...but it has great food.  Lots of freakin kids too.  Also...it is in the Quad, which means it is the best thing in the Quad....because the Quad is the 9th Circle of Hell."
5249,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I got recommended to come here by two friends of mine.  One went to this location and the other went to the West Vegas location.  Since I had just got into town, I wasn't willing to venture a drive so my group walked across the street to the IP to eat here. It was a Sunday so brunch menu was on.  After a modest wait, the hostess sat us down and after a couple of minutes, we were ready to order.  Then we waited...and waited...and waited...no water, no server greeting, nothing!  One of us flagged down a server and asked him if he was our server and he said he wasn't.  He said that he would try to find ours.  Then more waiting...and still nothing.  At this point, it was getting to the ridiculous stage.  Finally after 20 minutes of waiting, I went to the bar seating area and asked the bartender for four glasses of water.  I also told her that we have been ignored and she volunteered to take our order for us.  Thank you!!!  She literally saved our day...

Now I can go into how much food there was and how good it tasted and the combination of their chicken and waffles was...BUT, this place had a huge service failure which makes the food quality irrelevant in this case.  Sorry kitchen guys, nothing against y'all.

I do know that our bartender/server did speak to someone regarding the fact that our table was forgotten but did we get an apology or acknowledgement from a management rep?  Nope.  Am I surprised?  Not really.  With the way that they turn over tables and the mass amount of people/tourists that come through here, I'm really not surprised that the customer service is this severely lacking.  When I saw that the server who had the tables next to ours tell us that he couldn't take our order because he wasn't our ""server"", then that was a big warning sign that the management team here has not fostered an environment of teamwork within the front of house staff.  If they were a ""team"", then somebody would have stepped up and took our order despite us not being in his or her section.  Customer should come first but obviously that's not the case here.  

Hash A Go Go...I give you 3.5 stars for your food and product but the Imperial Palace location, I give you zero and that goes directly to the management who run this place on a daily basis.  I know for a fact that I'm not ever going to come back to this location.  

Belated thanks again to our savior who was the only person who helped to take our order and save our day.  We tipped her cash and in full and I asked that she not split that tip with her other servers because she was the only one who deserved it."
5250,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Can you say ""WOW!!""???

So delicious!!! The wait was long but well worth it!! We went and played downstairs for 40 minutes and really only waited about 20 minutes upstairs. 

Had the bacon jalapeÃ±o Bloody Mary and it was amazing!!!! So much flavor. 

I can't remember what my breakfast was called but it consisted of egg, fried chicken, biscuit, tomato, bacon, country gravy and mashed potatoes----all piled up high. It was so much food. So so yummy!!!"
5251,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Be prepared for a leisurely meal at Hash House a Go Go, but trust me, it is worth the wait.  We waited 45 minutes for a table and the food took about 20 minutes to get to the table (but the menu and the server inform you of the long prep time).  The food is funky, creative, and definitely a twist.  Even thought the portions are monstrous, the food still tastes pretty good.  

My boyfriend and I ordered the snickers pancake and the quesadilla stuffed with potatoes, eggs, tomatoes, and jalapenos smothered with a chili cream sauce.  The pancake was fluffy and it definitely felt like we were eating dessert for breakfast.  The quesadilla was really good too, even though it was heavy on the potatoes and light on the eggs.  It was like comfort food on an enormous platter.  

The prices are reasonable especially considering that you will leave with lots of leftovers.  The service was great, and our server continued to check up on us and see how we were doing throughout the meal, and while we were waiting for our meal."
5252,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Now everybody clap your hands...CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP! 

While having brunch, the electric slide song came on, and everyone was singing along and dancing. We were def in Vegas! 

We came here after being to Hash House a Go Go in San Diego. We were craving the Bloody Mary, and was a little disappointed when we got it. It was good, but didn;t have as much flavor as the location in SD. 

Portions are big, food is alright."
5253,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It's true what they say about this dish! This meal was AMAZING. Would recommend if you have a savory tooth, you might want to share this with someone else. I could only eat half."
5254,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We got here at 8.40am, perfect timing as it got  very loud and busy around 9am. The chicken fried steak looks big in the pictures but nothing to the size when it arrive, it's HUGE and not possible for one person to eat it.  Would recommend splitting with someone.  Flavor was really good as was the biscuit, the potatoes have full cloves of roasted garlic in them and was not for me.  The basic plate was ok although the sausages were cold and had to send them back.   Don't be in a rush if you come here as our waitress seemed to disappear for 15 mins when she said I'll be right back with your bill"
5255,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Delicious! Staff is friendly, coffee and food are delicious, and the portions are huge. That's my only gripe - I had to stop myself from cleaning my plate of eggs, potatoes, biscuit, and fruit or I'd have exploded. 

Service and quality was far superior to that of the hotel next door, where I stayed."
5256,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I had really high hopes for this place because I heard so much about it, but the food was just ok.  The best part was probably the biscuit!  I did think it was pretty cool all the food was fresh and our server, Travis, was very nice and recommended a lot of great dishes to us. 

The wait was about 20 min around 10 o'clock, the places was pretty packed when we got there.  I was also expecting a huge serving of food, but I didn't think whatever we got was that large (not that I need to eat a huge meal, but I was expecting a Man vs. Food heaping size infront of me)."
5257,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I ordered one menu item at Hash House A Go Go, but it feels like so much more. The claim to fame for Hash House is ""Twisted Farm Food."" I am here to tell you that slogan is 120% accurate. The bonus 20 being the astronomical amount of food so it felt wrong to just give it 100%.

This was my first Vegas brunch, I almost despise myself for going here first because it simply cannot get better than this. Perhaps i should quit telling you about how great this place is, and start walking you through my experience eating the food.

Chicken and Waffles

I may have had a slightly better waffle before in my life, but only slightly. 
I may have had a slightly better piece of fried chicken in my life, but only slightly.
Put them together and I know for a fact I have never had a better plate of Chicken and Waffles...ever, like ever ever.

You get brought a towering plate of four waffles and multiple fried chicken breasts. The best way to read this review is by going to HHAGG, order this dish, then step by step read and follow along on your own plate!

Step 1: Order the Chicken and Waffles.
Seriously if you don't follow this step, then I am not sure what has happened in your life to make you this way, but from the bottom of my heart I feel for you.

Step 2: Stare at Mt. Awesome (Owners of HAGG, feel free to change the name of the dish to this, I don't need a shoutout...but understand that I'd totally take it if offered.)
Just seeing pictures and videos of the chicken and waffles don't do it justice. It's kinda like watching Ocean's 11 and feeling like you've seen Las Vegas and know all about it. You just don't get it until you've seen it live and in person

Step 3: Create your plan of attack.
You should know going in that there is a wooden rod, presumably used to ensure Mt. Awesome does not come tumbling down, driven straight through. Do not let your stomach get the better of you and start eating before you have removed the rod. I've seen many an eater's dreams dashed by way of hurting a tooth on the rod.

Step 4: Pour Syrup and go to town.
First take a bite of just chicken. Embrace the fried breading that cradles the perfectly cooked chicken beneath it. This begins your journey to happiness.
Follow that bite with a piece of solo waffle. Crazy delicious right? Makes you realize that you should take the long way on your walk home because there can't be waffles this good there.

Step 5: Mix the Delicacies
Mix the entire plate together. Eat a bite with a little bit of everything in it....Did you do it? If you are still reading then you must not have because all electronics are shut off the very second you taste it all. There is no outside world anymore, there is only chicken and waffles at HHAGG. Welcome to the rest of your life. I'm glad you joined us on the other side.

My wife wants to name our next dog ""Hash"""
5258,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love anywhere that I can get breakfast 24 hours a day! Great customer service, fast and friendly. 
Really delicious food and HUGE portion sizes. 
The watermelon cocktail and the chicken and waffles are MUST TRYS!!"
5259,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Amazing!! Wish I came here earlier in my trip. We had the french toast, and hh benedict with the tangerine mimosas.

Food was CRAZY. Large portions and loved how it all tasted. Waiter told us to try the pancakes (which bakes bananas and other stuff inside instead of on top!)

Definitely try the mimosas, so gooood!"
5260,Hash House A Go Go,5,I had the Hash House a hamburger with bacon and avocado. The average price of a burger is about $14.00 to $15.00. I also had the house lemonade which is fantastic. If you're in Las Vegas you should make this one of your stops. Plus this restaurant is open 24 hours and also have the best breakfast menu .
5261,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Dear Sweet Lord of Breakfast and  Debauchery...Do yourself a favor, and make sure that you are truly hungry when you come here, because the amount of deliciousness that is served to you will fill you up like a gelatinous mass of humanity. So good, just so good! 
I had the s'more mocha coffee, and that itself comes in a soup mug, and is topped with a thick layer of torched marshmallow. I only got about halfway through it...but so good!
For breakfast (actually dinner, as this place is open 24/7) I had the corned beef hash. Which is shredded corned beef (not the canned), potatoes (diced and spiced with flakes from Heaven), and then churned in cheese. It also comes with two eggs of your choice, some asparagus (because why not), and some fruit. This mammoth of breakfast is served in a cast iron skillet. Again, I only got about halfway through, as my stomach screamed from being stuffed. 
My boyfriend got the sage chicken benedict, and the plate that was brought out could have served a family of four. Two pieces of breaded Godzilla chicken drenched in sauce, and layered on spinach, tomato, smoked bacon, and then placed on a sea of potatoes. God bless him for trying, but he too succumbed to his stomach pleading for mercy. 
Seriously, come HUNGRY! Or, like we said we would do next time, split something. Our bill was on $50.00, which may sound like a lot, but you certainly get what you pay for!"
5262,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Perfect hangover food.
We waited approximately 45min before we were seated, there was about 12 of us, so it was understandable. I asked our server which was the best dish in his opinion and he said the Sage Fried Chicken Breast & Waffles, so I ordered it. Not disappointed AT ALL. I love my friend chicken crispy not too oily, and this was perfect, the waffles were fluffy. I couldnt finish my dish, the portions were huge.

Service was friendly and sweet. They talked to us while we waited to be seat. When you're hung over from a night out in Vegas, this is the place to be. NOM."
5263,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I absolutely loooved this place!  The food is fairly price and they give you large portions.  I had the chicken biscuits with sausage gravy and cheddar cheese eggs which is my favorite brunch menu item.  When me and the hubby go back to Vegas, we are definitely going to hit up this spot again!"
5264,Hash House A Go Go,4,"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Very popular 24/7 breakfast place! Usually a 30-minute wait. 

EntrÃ©e: Tractor Driver Combo
Pancake or waffle with potatoes and eggs. Food was great! Waffle was light and fluffy and not overly sweet. Unfortunately, I was disappointed because they do not allow substitutions (I wanted toast instead of eggs). 

They're well known for their Chicken and Waffles, and let me tell, it was HUGE. Every entrÃ©e can be shared by at least two people!"
5265,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place had great food, with huge portions-well, sort of. The waffle breakfast that my sister had came with a huge waffle (enough to feed two people), two eggs, and two strips of bacon. I didn't really see the use of a huge waffle unless you were eating five bites of waffle and then one bite of the egg and bacon. But that's just me, I like my food to be proportional with each other. The same thing with my pancake, two sausages (which was more generous than the two skinny pieces of bacon) and two eggs. I mean, who takes home half a huge waffle/pancake? Not worth the trouble..Needless to say, it went to waste. The food quality was excellent though. And our server was great, the place wasn't packed but we didn't wait too long for our food. Our server was friendly and the atmosphere was ok at best. The tabletop was sticky and it didn't feel very clean. Also, it is located in the quad, which had a terrible parking layout and most of the elevators were broken and the overall atmosphere was dingy. The quad itself felt tacky and kind of dirty to be honest. I liked the syrup and whipped butter was awesome!"
5266,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Same menu as the San Diego location except no wild boar hash. The portions are HUGE and easily shared by two people, which makes the prices very reasonable. Great coffee. And unlike San Diego, you can actually get in the door! (At the Rio)"
5267,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I have to give this place 5 stars for the sheer amount of food you get at a reasonable price!! My pictures aren't quite as beautiful as some of the other ones posted here, but I had an amazing bacon and avocado scramble (not pictured but highly recommend!) with a banana pancake on the side. The pancakes are HUGE! And judging by some of the other plates I saw, there are so many amazing-looking breakfast combinations with fantastic presentation!

I also wanted to note that the service was STELLAR and they were extremely accommodating to some food allergies I have. Truly appreciate all the staff members here! Next time I'm in Vegas you can count on me being back!"
5268,Hash House A Go Go,1,"This complaint goes to Brandy (291299). She is RUDE. First she can't get our orders right. Then she said no add ons allowed once she takes her order. Then as we were still eating (they only gave us 10 minutes to eat), she gives us our check and says ""I'm just going to close your tab but take your time, okay"". 2 minutes after saying that, she comes back and says ""you're still working on that? I'll give you a few more minutes"".  We still gave her a tip but it was not the normal tip that we usually give. She really did not deserve any tip whatsoever regardless of the amount just like how she does not deserve a single star on yelp but we are left with no choice because yelp does not allow negative stars."
5269,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great service. Portions are huge.  The price is high but you will most likely be full for the day.

Bloody Mary was great.  Had the fried chicken Benedict is was good.  Just remember the portions are large."
5270,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love this place!  I would definitely eat here next time I'm in Vegas.  The first time I came, I had the bacon-stuffed waffle.  Fantastic!  And huge!  I could only eat half of it.  The second time I came, I had the BLT Bloody Mary (spicy, tasty goodness with a good amount of alcohol), and the Hash that had meatloaf, peppers, cheese, and spinach.  It also came with scrambled eggs and a big-a** biscuit.  Again, huge portion of food and only ate half of it.  The potato hash dish did need a bit more pepper, but all and all it was tasty.  

Highly recommend the BLT Blood Mary.  Good stuff, especially if it's the first drink of the day."
5271,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is the place to go if you're looking to get your money's worth on the strip. The best items are available all day and are large enough that you can split a single dish with someone or take your leftovers to get two meals out of it (I'm definitely okay with that in Vegas). The bloody mary's don't quite live up to the marketing, but that only brings this place to a 4.5/5, and I'm willing to round up in this case.

Their fried chicken benedict is fantastic, and while it's not as light as you would expect it to be... it really doesn't matter when it's gigantic and you're already drunk from watching some of the morning games down at the sportsbook bar in Planet Hollywood. Each individual part of the benedict was delicious and the price for it made the entire meal a great value. I've been to several places in other Casino resorts that charge more for the same ""quality"" of fare and give you a lot less in terms of taste, size, and price. The service staff when I went this last time was friendly and took care of me promptly despite a busy bar. I will always make it a point to visit here when I'm down in Sin city."
5272,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome food & service. Ginormous portions. 25 min wait on a Friday morning. I was between the fried chicken benny and chicken & waffles. I asked the server if he died tomorrow, what he would choose? He said benny with no hesitation. 

The staff works like a well oiled machine and servers seem genuinely happy.

5273,Hash House A Go Go,4,Went there for dinner . Ordered the pot pie and the hubby ordered the waffle and chicken ... holy crap. Talk about gigantic servings !!! I can eat a lot but I ate half of my pot pie and my husband ate one of the 4 bacon stuffed waffles and one of the two huge chicken breast. The syrup was tasty ... to be honest everything was really really good for a good price !!! They give free biscuit with a buttery honey pool u see it before our plates arrived. That was probably too much lol. The biscuit was also big !!! Over all... we went for dinner at around 7 and no wait was so ever . Waitress was nice and the food came in quick and piping hot .
5274,Hash House A Go Go,4,"came here with 4 families. our waiter scotty was extremely knowledgeable and accommodating. portion size is huge. tried their bloody mary, savory and delicious. went for their andy sage chicken benedict. this dish was featured on man vs food. wow, it was a huge tower of food. i did ok and ate most except the mash potatoe at the bottom. overall the experience is positive. great deal for what you get."
5275,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Meh.  The wait was reasonable. The service was good.   The food was not great. I had the banana French toast which was good, but the bacon didn't come crispy as I requested. The blueberry pancakes were dry. It was a real let down for a Las Vegas breakfast spot. Go to The egg and I on Sahara instead."
5276,Hash House A Go Go,2,"What a big sloppy mess - sadly I mean the food, not me. Maybe I wasn't drunk enough?

We were seated immediately upon entering at 3am on a Wednesday.

Our Sage Fried Chicken orders (1 Benedict and 1 with Bacon Waffles) took ~25 mins to come out, which in hindsight was not worth the wait. 

Yes the portions were redonkulously ginormous. But the flavors: disappointingly subpar; the presentation: unappetizing; and the overall execution left us unsatisfied. 

Two decadent things that make ANYTHING ""Benedict"" sexcellent: hollandaise sauce and perfectly poached eggs. 

So right off the bat this ""Benedict"" is lacking:
* hollandaise is substituted with their ""chipotle cream""... Boooo;
* no yolky goodness. What should've been poached eggs (per my request) still came out scrambled (per standard menu description). Ugh I was so looking forward to satisfying my need to poke a runny yolk. 

My husband liked the mash potatoes my meal was plated atop but I discarded the mushy biscuits beneath the kitchen-sink pile of fluff on my plate... Including the sticks of uncooked spaghetti impaling my food. Hella random garnish - I just didn't get it. 

Bottom line: there are better things we could've spent our $50 on: black jack, pai gow, wheel of fortune, and/or more alcohol.

5277,Hash House A Go Go,4,"About 3 people recommended this place so I figured I had to try It out. I thought from the reviews that it was going to be pricey but my bill with a drink and food was less than 25 bucks.  We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated but it went by quickly and once seated, the waiters were awesome. The servings are huge and the food was delicious.  I tried the most popular dish which is the sage chicken benedict and it was really good. Better than eating a regular eggs and bacon type breakfast."
5278,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Okay... we were SO EXITED to eat here... talked about it for weeks before our trip... practically RAN up the escalator, right into the arms of... no one... we waited at least five minutes before we were even approached to be seated. Whatever, no biggie, right?
Unfortunately, the service was down right weird, the portions of the entrees are (no joke) big enough to feed a family of four, so ordering multiple courses (and having the opportunity to sample multiple menu items) is out.  The food is mediocre at best and, to add insult to injury, the prices listed on the menu for certain items are less than the actual prices that you are charged. When we asked our server about it, she acted like we were ruining her night and begrudgingly agreed to ask her manager about it. About 15 minutes later, she returned with an amended bill and some lame excuse about how the menus were actually meant for their other location. But aren't the locations very close by each other and shouldn't the prices be the same? I don't know... All I can say is we left what we thought would be a very lovely and fun dinner feeling disappointed and slightly queasy."
5279,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fantastic food. I've been a few times and it's been good each time. I usually get the chicken and waffles or the chicken Benedict. 

The portions are huge- two people can generally share one dish. 

The menu is headlined as 'twisted farm food'- very true. It's pretty much pure American food with little foreign influence. 

If you like big portioned American food (specifically breakfast), this place is for you."
5280,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love the hash house here!!!!!! My favorite one! Don't go to the one at the Rio. You must try the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict!!!!! You will not regret it! Warning though, you should share it since the portion is huge! Everything is perfect about it! Except the extra biscuit at the bottom... It's unnecessary and too filling. The sauce they give us is also bomb, so creamy!"
5281,Hash House A Go Go,4,Had a great breakfast and a good time.  The wait was long and price was high but what do you expect from a popular quality place in Vegas.
5282,Hash House A Go Go,2,"What happened to Hash House? I feel like this location butchered the image of Hash house for me. I had gone to the one in San Diego, CA and it was so delicious. Ahh!

Anyway, my husband and I came here last year, and it was his first time. After my raving, I know he felt let down by the quality, or lack there-of.

My omelette and biscuits were so BLAND and my husband's dish (forgot which one it was) was not tasty at all either. Even adding hot sauce didn't suffice. Won't be back!"
5283,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is fresh and delicious. The portions are very big. The pancake on kid's menu is huge.
5284,Hash House A Go Go,2,"This place was a roller coaster ride of excitement and disappointment. 

When I was randomly looking for lunch places in Vegas while my ladyfriend was at her conference this place popped up. Having just watched Man vs Food and seeing this place I figured what the hell, let's try it out. Looking at the prices for lunch I knew it would be a gamble, but this is Vegas, so let's bet it all!

I was by myself so I sat at the bar and was serviced by a pleasant enough spikey hair lady behind the bar. No problems here.

I ordered the chicken and waffles because that's their ""specialty"" and it should fill me up from about 11am til dinnertime.

It arrived quickly in all its visual majesty. It really is an impressive tower. Check out my pic, it's like #250 in the yelp list. Four large waffles topped by a 4 giant pieces of fried chicken. This is going to be awesome I said to myself.

Then, I started eating some of it, and my joy turned to sorrow. Sadly, the fried chicken had no flavor. I don't think I've ever had flavorless fried chicken, but this place somehow pulled it off.

Next, the waffles. There too was a I disappointed. They were really bready and had none of that malty waffle goodness. I had to ask for more syrup just to make the whole thing edible.

Yes, it is a gigantic amount of food, but for $16, it better look AND taste good, and this wasn't the case. This was my most expensive lunch $20+ and also the worst. Sometimes you bet it all and lose it all in Vegas..."
5285,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This was literally the first place I ever ate in Vegas, way back in the day when my fiancÃ© was interviewing for medical school.  Sigh.  Memories.

The food is decent.  I remember seeing something about Hash House A Go Go on Man vs. Food, which is the initial reason I wanted to come here.  Now that I've eaten here several times, I can say that the food is pretty decent.  I don't eat fried things, so I don't order some of the dishes that are well-known (like the chicken and waffles).  I am probably missing out, and I'm okay with that. 

The service is really hit-or-miss."
5286,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Meh.  Nothing special here. I had the Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion & swiss scramble.  It was a bit of a mess and the plate was 80% potatoes.  The staff was friendly enough and I was in and out quickly.  Certainly nothing worth waiting for."
5287,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.! 

First things first...my husband was positively GREEN (not in a good way) from our insanely wild vacation. But this place is perfect for a Vegas-sized hangover (or so said Scott, our server). The table next to ours and the one behind us were busy oooohing and aaaaahing as the food fashion show commenced. After he briefly blanched at the size of the entrees, hubby finally decided to go with the sage fried chicken w/ maple reduction, eggs, biscuit and bacon mashed potatoes. It was the perfect cure.

Since I'd already been there a few times, I wanted to try something new, and decided to og with the meatloaf w/ 2 eggs, mashed potatoes, and biscuit. When I asked Scott for a little jam for my biscuit, he brought back the most delightful, delicious peach compote concoction I've ever had. It tasted very much like the inside of a peach cobbler. Mmmmmmm!!!! 

For the amount of food, the reasonable prices and the excellent quality of preparation, we will, of course, return...and bring additional back-up to battle the beast that is Vegas."
5288,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent breakfast and I would definitely recommend it. The portions are huge so sharing is recommended. The pancake is huge but full of flavor and nice and fluffy. The benedict's are very tasty. I've been here once and definitely will return. Expect a little bit of a wait for breakfast.
5289,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always very consistent with the quality of food, service and hospitality. Come hungry!"
5290,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We have a Hash House in San Diego and the wait is always over 2 hours. I did it once, and swore I'd never do it again. Because I refuse to do the wait, when we were in town visiting, my fiancÃ© wanted to give Hash House a try since he's never been. 

We came in on a Friday around 12 PM for brunch. We were quoted about 25 minutes before we could be sat. What's awesome about this location is that they have a bartender by the hostess who can make you drinks while you wait for  your table so you don't have to go up to the bar. I liked this idea!

Since there was open seating at the bar, we decided to just hop up there and opt out of waiting for a table. I warned him that the portions are HUGE and since I didn't feel like walking out of there in a food coma, we should just share a plate. Judging by the two men seated next to us who looked like they were struggling to get another bite down, he decided to take my advice (smart guy lol).

We both ordered up Bloody Mary's- which were perfect- not too much horseradish ( I hate horseradish so the fact that it was in there and I couldn't taste it, was awesome), and perfectly spicy. Of course my fiancÃ© opted to ""man"" up his Bloody Mary and ordered the BLT Bloody Mary.

We decided to share the chicken and waffles. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the center, another bonus for all you bacon lovers out there. The sage fried chicken was good, but the sage was WAY too over powering. 

Overall, it was decent- nothing crazy. The portion sizes are what draws people in but the taste is meh. 

I probably won't be back unless I'm with a group of people who absolutely insist on coming and even then- I'd probably just order a bloody marry.
Oh, a plus is the bartenders kicked ass! Great energy, great customer service!"
5291,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Less is more. I wish this place was better. I have been wanting to try HHAGG for a long time, but it never seems to work out. I finally made it on Tuesday morning and felt sick all day. It's carb overload. (thats hard for me to say because I LOVE carbs).

The meal just started off on the wrong foot. I HATE spicy food, and I have a weak tolerance. I ordered the HH Original which is smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and two basted eggs. All this over the biscuits and then over a huge pile of mashed potatoes. Reading this on the menu, there is no spice - safe for me to eat. Not so fast... when the plate comes it is decorated in a red sauce (which I was falsely led to believe was red pepper cream) and took a nice big taste of it and turned out to be hot sauce. It sent my taste buds into a frenzy and I really wish they would just garnish the plate with the actual red pepper cream instead of adding the hot sauce to the plate. It really ruined my taste buds for the rest of the meal. 

Overall, just disappointed. Not worth all the fuss."
5292,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Let me start by saying AMAZING! I've been told about this place a few times and finally got the option to try it. I ordered the sage chicken & waffles which was heaven on a plate. First let's start with the chicken it was two large pieces of breast that we NOT dry surprisingly. The waffle are the best they look like ordinary waffle until you cut into them...Full strips of bacon were hidden inside which made them absolutely delightful. The portions are big enough to share. I had the kiwi watermelon lemonade which you can have virgin or spiked. 

The kids menu is a downfall it's only for 10 and under and my daughters plate was way more than she could eat."
5293,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The portion sizes are generous and the presentation excellent. Service was also exceptional except for the very long wait to be seated. I was a little disappointed that my waffles were dry. I like butter and syrup on my waffles. Also, I like real butter and real maple syrup and I just did not taste either."
5294,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Visited this place in Vegas and its absolutely amazing , came here for brunch and was not disappointed. Warning : the food is larger portion in serving , so make sure your hungry or ready to share with your boo. I got the tractor pancakes and my bae had the sage chicken Benedict. Definitely cheap and worth the 5 stars !"
5295,Hash House A Go Go,4,Went to HH for breakfast on a weekday about 8:30. We had to wait about ten minutes or so and they seemed pretty disorganized getting people seated even though there were plenty of empty tables. But once we got seated is was all good. My wife had the French toast with bananas and a maple reduction that was really tasty. I had the fried chicken Benedict which was killer. The chipotle cream sauce was what really made it for me. I really liked the fresh spinach and tomato on it too. About the only real thing that I can say remotely negative about the place is that the servings are HUGE. Just too much food for most people. Almost seems like a waste. I'd go back in a second for any meal to try some of their other dishes.
5296,Hash House A Go Go,5,"SO. GOOD. 15/10 would recommend. 

My parents and sister talked this place up so me and my boyfriend decided to go try it out. My sister said she's tried to go numerous times but the wait was too long.. but I guess me and my boyfriend got there at a perfect time because only waited about 10 mins(enough to get a drink beforehand).

Our waiter was super attentive despite it being sooo busy which is much appreciated. He didn't make us feel rushed like most places only give you a certain amount of time which was nice. 

Once our food was served..... oh my god. 110% didn't disappoint. The portions are HUGE!! My pancake was bigger than the plate and It was THE MOST DELICIOUS pancake ever. The brown sugar made it a little crispy. It was to die for. My boyfriend had the chicken fried cheesesteak(also gigantic) and from his review was amazing! We took the food home and ate the rest of it. 

We will for sure come back!"
5297,Hash House A Go Go,4,"That corned beef hash is awesome! Huge portions, and 11am or 2 am always done up right. Bloody Mary's are nice and spicy. I keep coming back for more punishment. Fantastic 24/7 breakfasts!!"
5298,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is the place to go for breakfast. Make sure you bring your reading glasses because there are so many choices to choose from. I had the most juicy I'm late with cheddar and jalapeÃ±os that it made my mouth water. The music in the background is great and the servers always have a smile on their face
5299,Hash House A Go Go,5,"ONE OF MY FAVES!!!
If you are going to Vegas must try. Servings are definitely big enough for two. They taste amazing and very affordable. Since you in Vegas thats a plus! I actually flew in pretty early so with the time difference i was starving.. Seems we got in right before the breakfast crowed so service and food were both great!! As we were leaving I noticed line down the stairs so may want to come early or after crowds. We had Sage Chicken and Waffles, Andys Sage fried chicken Benedict and a Scrambled Hash.. all three were YUM!!! 


I came July 2nd 2013
Must try!!"
5300,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I ordered a double patty burger and anything that has avocado, I do tend to order.  The presentation of the burger is dramatic with a serrated knife stuck in the middle of the burger to keep it all together.  

My burger was a little big salty for my taste, but it was juicy.  I had a side salad that came with the meal and it was a decent portion with minimal fixings, but still satisfying.  I like to have a little greens with my meal and they did a great job with the salad too.

The plating and presentation is dramatic and served in big portions."
5301,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Food was awesome but did have 1 issue. My 3 1/2 year old ordered a quesadilla with chicken (they have a quesadilla on the menu, but we wanted to add chicken) the server brought it out, with the chicken on the side...she said the cooks wouldn't put the chicken in the quesadilla because ""it's against company policy to change a recipe"" Our entire table was shocked. The server was apologetic, but I was shocked that something so simple couldn't be done.  So as I cut up the chicken to put in the quesadilla, I opened it to find the cheese wasn't even melted.  That was actually the only issue with food I had."
5302,Hash House A Go Go,2,"If I were reviewing food alone this would be an easy 4 star, maybe even 5, it's the only reason we went twice.  That sage fried chicken will forever be in my dreams; unfortunately the service will always haunt my nightmares.  Two days in a row you guys failed.  Hard.  Telling us to come check on our table in 20-30 minutes because the buzzers don't work in the casino (why even give them out? If we aren't in the casino we are sitting right in front of your face, just call our name), then when we come back in exactly 19 minutes you have given away our table and proceed to sit three more parties in front of us.  Don't tell us we can go downstairs if you are going to give away our table.  Our waiter on this day was a little flighty; service was al little slow, but nothing too bad, 20% was earned. But day two taught us how bad it could be.  Our server started off with a little banter, a little personality is always nice, and was lacking the day before.  Then she was gone.  I had ordered a BLT Mary (which was delicious), and delivered to my table after about 10-15 minutes by someone else,  our server did appear when I had finished it to see if id like another.  I said no thank you, but some more water would be nice, and a dining companion asked for a re-fill on her diet coke.  The diet coke made it back, but no water.  Then another server brought out one of our four food orders.  A bit later two more orders, then the final.  Still no server and no water.  None of us got water until we were finished eating and finally flagged down a server from another table, and you can imagine how long that was with the size of their portions.  We waited about 10 more minutes, still thirsty, and finally asked a bus boy for water and a box.  He brought the water, thank god.  After another 10 minutes out server came back, we asked for her to get the box, she did.  We also asked for out check.  She gave us some flack about coupons, but finally got it done.  WORST SERVICE EVER
Moral of the story, sage chicken delish, but have lots of time and low expectations for everything else."
5303,Hash House A Go Go,5,"2nd visit here, after two years. The quality hasn't changed, we ordered the vegetarian hash browns. Perfect eggs, fresh biscuits, perfectly cooked veggies. Didn't disappoint! I love the food at Hash House!"
5304,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Located inside the Linq Hotel. I hit Hash House A Go Go with a couple of my friends during our stay for some breakfast food. I was not disappointed!

Walked in without a reservation, and only waited about 15 minutes. The hostess told us it would be around 20-30 minutes but they beat that time.

Food portions are MASSIVE! You can honestly probably split between two people. I wasn't able to finish all my meal so I just got it boxed up to go. 

Service was quick and friendly!!"
5305,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Arrived to Vegas Linda late, but hungry. After I checked in to flamingo and my friends checked in to the Linq, we headed up the tiny elevator and got our grub on. Definitely hit the spot and the Bloody Mary was delicious."
5306,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow, this place meets all the expectations the reviews suggest. Food was fantastic and the portions huge.  The wait staff looked like a local Harley club and were some of the most considerate and attentive people I met while visiting Las Vegas. I wish I had discovered this place my first day rather than just before my flight home. I will return on my next visit, which I hope is soon!"
5307,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I love going to this place in Chicago and was excited to go in Vegas! 

I got a tomato basil and feta scramble and my friend got the chocolate chip pancakes! The secret about the pancakes is they do indeed have chocolate chips... you just have to ask! The pancake was as big as my head and my scramble was so yummy. 

We also got some drinks because vegas, baby! The drinks were good, but not anything spectacular. They were however the cheapest option we had seen in Vegas! 

I had the electric lemonade and my friend had the mojito!"
5308,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My biggest quandary with this place is whether I'm going to be going back there by myself in October when I'm in Vegas again, or if I have to drag my cousins along....  

Oh Hash House, you go-go with the yummy food!  My girl friend loves this place so much the nut bought everyone t-shirts to wear in Northern Virginia.  She said she couldn't stand to be the only person wearing their T-shirt.  And yes, we were so jealous when she went back to Vegas without us for a conference and took pictures to send our way.  (There were some names that were used in text exchanges, but thats neither here nor there.) 

We were just there in June.   And nostalgically I recall that someone ordered their pancakes...stupid enormous, I had french toast and a side of biscuits and gravy.  Did I say side?  More like a HUGE portion for one.  Hubby had corned beef hash and says it was too good to not continue eating.  (I know he over did it because he could barely eat ONE In and Out Burger 4 hours later!)  

We went really early in the morning for breakfast and they were empty.  Still, we liked going through the maze that is the Quad to go up the escalator to the yumminess that 
awaited us.   Given that there are so many awesome places to eat, we didn't eat there again, but its on our list of places to hit up without a DOUBT!  Service was prompt, the place was clean and well maintained, and food was DELISH!!!  Can't wait to go back again.  Now.....I heard they have a location in Chicago too....hrmm......"
5309,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've tried 3 different locations to see what the buzz was about and I'm convinced that this just isn't my type of restaurant. However, if you're looking for mediocre ginormous portioned food then you're probably love this place."
5310,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We visited the hash house on a Thursday around 3:00 pm. Although there were many tables available, they still made us wait. The food is really good, but I only gave it 2 stars because the music was so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation, much less hear our waitress when she took our order. We couldn't wait to get out of there, as we all had headaches from the noise."
5311,Hash House A Go Go,5,By far my favorite breakfast place! At first I was thinking the prices were a bit expensive until I saw the insane large portions you get! It was so delicious. I am so glad I was recommended by friends to go here.
5312,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Decent. But definitely quantity over quality or at least with the giant thing that I got called the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.

Overall I think this is probably quite decent at 2am if you're drunk.

Staff was friendly, but arguably all high as a kite :)"
5313,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Bland. Very, very bland. Huge disappointment, despite the hype. The only thing ""twisted"" about this place is the sheer amount of crap they pile on and not a single gram of seasoning.

We ordered Andy's sage chicken and eggs with bacon mashed potatoes; and sausage gravy with biscuits. The chicken was dry. The maple reduction made the breading a bit soggy, which created an unsavory contradiction.

Had breakfast at 10 am on Thursday morning. Wait was 10 minutes. Service was fair. Food was not worth the price, despite the large portion (which was left unfinished and us unsatisfied). Won't be coming back here again."
5314,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Our second time eating here and once again it doesn't disappoint. Last year I had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict since it seemed like the restaurants most famous dish but this year I opted out for for the Chicken & Waffles and both are amazing. First as you can see in the pictures, the portions are MASSIVE. The fried chicken & waffles had two huge pieces of chicken breast and four Belgian waffles. The best part of the waffles though, they make it with bacon inside! Such a great combo of sweet & salty. Definitely worth checking this place out when in Vegas and due to the portion size recommend sharing a dish."
5315,Hash House A Go Go,3,"3.5 to be exact. My feelings are mixed about this place. Not sure if the quality and attention are top notch here to deserve a full 5 star rating.
This is definitely a tourist stop. Long lines and lots of peeps wanting to try their food. Good thing is that they are open 24/7! You can be there 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. They will be ready for you.
Their slogan is bringing the farm to your table. Also famous because they were featured on Man vs Food show on the Travel Channel.
So were the food we ordered up to our expectations?
I have enjoyed their humongous plate of chicken & waffles.  From the plate presentation to the taste, I get why this is a popular dish. So on that note, that dish alone deserves 4 stars for me.
My hubby is a corn beef hash snob! He loves that above anything and it is his favorite breakfast dish.  The description of the corn beef by our server sounded great. That the corn beef is house made and cured, made from scratch! My hubby got really excited and ordered the dish.
What came out looked amazing! In the biggest skillet ever! Looked like a 5 star dish, only this was very disappointing.
The first bite off his corn beef - he was cringing. My hubby isn't at all that sensitive about the salt content but it was so salty he said he couldn't eat it by itself. So he try to eat it with the potato hash. That's where it went all wrong for the hubs. They totally were all cooked in different temperatures or something but most of the potatoes were undercooked. I don't know about you but I despise undercooked potatoes. They are simply not edible. The only saving grace for his skillet were the fruits and eggs, he said. He was beyond bummed about it. Now you maybe wondering why he didn't address the issue with the server? 
Service began great with a friendly server but after the food was delivered to our table, we didn't get to see our server until we were ready to leave. By then my husband sorta gave up on his dish already.
He was like why bother, we won't come back. Besides that, we were never offered refills on our waters or asked if we needed anything else from the server.
It was hectic at the restaurant with so many people. At least getting our check and paying was easy. They come to you with card processors for plastic pay.
So I understand the hype but my overall experience was rather underwhelming to grant them anything more than a 4.
Definitely go, if you're a big breakfast plate person! Hope your experience will be better than ours!"
5316,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Delicious !!!

It's affordable and the food is amazing !!!

Eggs potatoes and waffle for 15$. Can't beat that.  
There was a wait if about 15 minutes. However, we stood by the bar and waited for a seat to open up. That took about 5 minutes. 

The customer service was amazing !! Our server ""Randa"" was always around and attentive.  Definitely ask her when you come :) 

Definitely a must visit."
5317,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best breakfast I have had in my entire life. I had the fried chicken eggs Benedict and I was amazed at how good the chicken was perfectly fried and moist and how awesome the entire plate was. If your in Vegas this is a must if you don't just don't bother living anymore!
5318,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I've never been to a place where service is soo horrible.
there was urine all over their photo machine.. and workers instead of cleaning it up they are all just standing around chatting it up and just doing nothing.. not to mention we haven't even gotten our food and they were already giving us our bill!! WILL NEVER COME BACK!!"
5319,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best meal I ate in Vegas.  I shared the Chicken Benedict.  It was soooooo good. Come hungry.  I will go back next time I go to Vegas.
5320,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow!  The Chicken Fried Steak honestly deserves 5 stars in its own.  It's very difficult for me to rate anything Perfect, so I would say that the Chicken Fried Steak is a solid 4.8!

The steak is large and pretty close to perfect.
The breading is fantastic
The gravy is great!

Some of the best green beans I have ever had

Potatoes were perfect

Biscuit was very good

And the Strawberry Jam was actually EPIC in my opinion."
5321,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Came here based on recommendations- came about 4pm on a Saturday. Server was high energy but overwhelmed with all the tables in her section. Ordered 2 cocktails and agreed to the "" extra shot"" in my drink based on size..... says our server. Drinks come and the guy dropping them off didn't know which had the extra shot- watched the bartender Man handle our drinks and added more liquor to one..... to think... I'm paying for this. Ugh. 
We watched THREE OTHER TABLES get their food BEFORE us- that already strike two and my yam fries were cold and the burgers were blah- 

Maybe it was an off day- wouldn't come back."
5322,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It was a Sunday morning at 11:30 am and my friends and I had miraculously left our room by check-out time and dragged ourselves down to the 2nd floor of the Imperial Palace where the Hash House lives.  There was a gigantic crowd waiting outside, but we ended up being called to our table within 10 minutes.

We tried to glance at some other tables on our way in to get an idea of the food...and holy crap the portions are huge.  I recommend splitting if you can...you'll definitely still be full even with half of a meal.  

Our table of 3 ordered:  the tractor driver combo with the griddled french toast, the corned beef hash, and the original eggs benedict.  I sampled all of them and everything was amazing.  I supplemented my french toast breakfast with a much needed Bloody Maria.  This was my first time having the Bloody Maria, which uses tequila instead of vodka, and it was outstanding.  Settled my stomach and removed my hangover successfully!!

I was not even close to finishing my french toast.  There were two inch and a half thick slices that were about 5 inches square.  It was flavorful and served with a grilled banana.  

Our service was quick, friendly and attentive - no glasses were left empty and the coffee refills were plentiful.  

Only downside, aside from being in the Imperial Palace, is that the restaurant has no bathrooms of its own...and so you have to go wander through the casino and use the ones there."
5323,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I ate here recently after a long night and it more than met my expectations. Portions are huge, food is flavorful and the service was excellent. Pj was our server and I will definitely be back!!!"
5324,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent food and experience. PJ gave us great service. Literally the best place to go in Vegas.
5325,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Not a gem. I will not be going back here. The food was stale, the portions too large, the noise level was insane, and the atmosphere was super dark and dreary for a breakfast joint. Also, the seating at most of the tables was very uncomfortable and awkward. I truly do not know how this place has gotten a lot of positive reviews. It's just plain not good. Do yourself a favor and go hit a higher end restaurant and get GOOD breakfast. the only redeeming factor of this place may have been the waiter we had. He seemed genuinely concerned with our experience, though the service was fairly slow. Oh, and in addition to these issues, I just felt that the place was dirty, I would hate to see the kitchen..."
5326,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food is always amazing. My wife and I have the Tractor Driver Combo. We subbed out for the brown sugar banana pancakes. The food was amazing. It always is. 

On the other hand...the service was not. Our server Ray seemed great at first but we noticed something strange. When he came to our table he would be quiet, not very interactive and would come and go quickly but at the other tables he would stand around, laugh and talk. He was much more involved and interactive with the other tables. It made me wonder what was wrong with my wife and I. 

Either way, he didn't ruin it for us. We will be back."
5327,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Absolute the best of America at its maximum. Supersized portions but still offer smaller dishes for those that don't want to feel bloated for the whole day. A must do in Vegas every time we are here, love this place."
5328,Hash House A Go Go,4,"FINALLY made it to this place, it's been on my Vegas hit list for the last couple of trips and we finally made it this time!

Came on a Sunday around 4:30pm and there was absolutely no wait.  
I've heard that sometimes people weren't allowed to share entrees but we had no problems with that. Our server also didn't care that one of our friends was passed out at the table for the entire duration of the meal and that two of them weren't even wearing shoes. Ah, Vegas...

The bf had the chicken and waffles - which I happily helped him demolish. I had a hash house scramble with sun dried tomato and artichoke hearts. It was decent but I wouldn't order it again. It was sad that my biscuit was dry and crumbly though. 

Portion sizes here are ridiculous.

Just order the chicken and waffles, seriously."
5329,Hash House A Go Go,5,what an awesome place. the food was exactly. for two people you only need to order one dish. DELICIOUS
5330,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My family loved the food ordered. There was a wait, but it was ok. I recommend you trying it when you ate there, I will go back."
5331,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Portions here are stereotypically American (i.e huge). Service isn't the quickest, but it's obvious that they are always busy! Our food was delicious though! I had the giant breakfast quesadilla with some yummy sauce on it, and the husband had biscuits & gravy. Improvements would be wifi and/or some windows!"
5332,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Of course there's a line but who cares?! This place is the bomb! I ordered the tractor that comes with eggs, a biscuit & a brown sugar pancake. Holy moley, that thing was huge!! Best pancake hands down. I also ordered the kiwi watermelon tea...with the help of yelp reviewers. Thank you all!!"
5333,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Would recommend this to people. Come prepared to eat or to share a dish. Portions are huge and perfect for the price. Drinks are a bit pricey but the smores mocha coffee was worth the 8 bucks. 

Everything look delicious so had trouble deciding what to eat. Finally decided on the man v food favorite and it was delicious! The chipotle sauce gave it just enough kick and the fried chicken was juicy! Would get it again!"
5334,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The portions are HUGE and the prices are reasonable. I had the eggs benedict. It consisted of a tomato sauce, 2 eggs, and a biscuit on a pile of mashed potatoes.

The tomato sauce is an odd flavor to blend with breakfast foods. The mashed potatoes were bland and weird to have with eggs. The biscuit was on the dry side. Honestly, it was just a strange plate of food with conflicting flavors and textures. I would not order this again.
 
I ordered the Bloody Mary and sent it back after one sip. It was awful. 

Positives: Nice staff, the wait wasn't long, reasonable prices. 

I would go again and order something else. Maybe the items I tried were just bad. My friend had the portobella burger. It wasn't anything special but the pesto was tasty and the sweet potato fries were pretty good."
5335,Hash House A Go Go,5,Hash house all time best=j The food is the best But be ready for a very long wait WOW
5336,Hash House A Go Go,4,"When you come back to visit this place twice in a week for breakfast.. and decide to order the same exact thing for both days... I would say it says something about this place.

The consistency of the food and the portions will not disappoint you. Once I saw the Chicken and Waffles on the breakfast menu.... My sights targeted in for the kill.

The sage fried chicken is full of flavor and it's food like this that makes me miss living in the south. The addition of the fried leeks gives the dish a wonderful texture and flavor.. and the waffles were cooked perfectly. It was only a few days later I had to come back here to eat it again.

Service the second time around was a little lacking, but only because we caught them during a weekend and during the busy hours of breakfast. Nonetheless, the waiter was apologetic and still took care of what he could. I would still come back here.... ugh.. now I want some chicken and waffles..."
5337,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Food makes me happy. Good food makes me giddy! Hash House a Go Go makes me happy giddy, jump on tables, bonkers!

The portions are ridonculously humongous! I suggest sharing, but be wary of the split plate charge ($2.95). Just have the other person order a side of bacon, which'll cost you the same thing anyway. I've never had anything but their breakfast items here: pancakes, scrambles, hash, chicken & waffles. I heard there's another side to the menu that consists of lunch items...sandwiches n'stuff, but really...why would you wanna do that?!? 

Hash House A Go Go...I think I love you more than bacon."
5338,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Whenever we're in Vegas we always stop by at Hash House for some brunch...obviously we never wake up in time for breakfast time...but if you go at this time brunch/lunch, prepare for a wait.  It is always packed.  I always get their chorizo hash.  My husband tried their famous chicken and waffles.  Both are yum and very very large portions.  Seriously, one entree can feed 3.  Definitely stop by if you're looking for a good breakfast spot that is not IHOP."
5339,Hash House A Go Go,5,always good drunk food!!!    make a stop.. BIG ASS PORTIONS.. but when can eat when ur still hung over?
5340,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Portions were humongously huge!!  I would recommend sharing because one pancake is bigger than your head, no matter who you are. Food and service were great. The worst thing was the wait and that is because so many people want to go there."
5341,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We chose Hash House A Go Go based on Yelp reviews. It didn't disappoint! Since it was a Sunday and we didn't make reservations, we had to wait for 90 minutes to get a seat. The wait was worth every minute. We ordered red velvet pancakes, scrambled eggs. Delicious and lip smacking. The red velvet pancakes were so soft and velvety, one of a kind that we tried! The eggs and veggies were scrumptious, the biscuits soft and flaky. Nothing disappointed us, the service was impeccable and the sizes were huuuuuuge!!! Was worth every penny, do not go by the prices on the menu, cause the portions are so huge makes sense that it is slightly expensive. Must visit brunch spot when you visit Vegas!"
5342,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Before leaving to Vegas, my coworker insisted that I should eat at Hash House. We have one in Califonria, but she said that Vegas is a lot better. Well, since my coworker is so in love with this particular location, I had to try it out. My group of friends and I came on a busy summer Saturday morning around 11am. The hostess told us the wait would be about an hour or more. Go figure....because when we walked up the stairs (yes it is located upstairs of Harris Casino), we can see a large crowd of people, either standing or sitting. The waiting area is small and stuffy and full of hungover club-goers from the night before. 
We waited for about 30 minutes and we were tired of waiting. So we asked the girl who took down my number if we can order something to go and she said yes and told us to order it with the bartender. So my boyfriend and I walked over to the bartender and tried to get our orders in, but no one acknowledged us....We were literally flagging down the bartenders and the waiters but they just ignored it. I understand that this place gets packed and busy, but please dayummmn rude.  About 20 minutes in, we were finally asked ""How can I help you?"" At that time, our name was called and we ended up dining in.
We ended up ordering 2 items:
1. Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict, which comes with layers of ooey-gooey goodness! The infamous Sage-Fried Chicken, fresh spinach, scrambled eggs, hardwood smoked bacon, tomatoes, and grilled mozzarella are served on a bed of grilled mashed potatoes and fresh split biscuit, and lastly they top it with their homemade chipotle cream sauce!! This portion can feed up to 3 hungry people. For something that cost around $13-20 and that is shared with 2-3 adults, it's worth it! The plate came out pretty messy, but it tasted amazing. The chicken was crispy and juicy, and eggs and bacon can never go wrong together. I finished a little portion and had the worst food coma I've had in a while. 
2. Of course we ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  The waffles were thick and fluffy and also stuffed with bacon inside! Major plus for the bacon eaters! The chicken was surrounded with leek and a stick of sage that was pierced into the chicken. The fried chicken was delicious, perfectly made and so moist. It wasn't all greasy like the chicken you would get from Popeyes or KFC

Everything was so delicious, and none of us finished out plates. There were 6 of us by the way. I will definitely come back, at an odd hour like 5am to avoid the wait. I hope the staffs can help us faster next time.. Its worth checking out if you take it for what its worth."
5343,Hash House A Go Go,4,Very good food. I mean I've never seen such LARGE Portions but the food was great. One bite of my boyfriends rosemary chicken and eggs Benedict and I was like wow this is very yummy!
5344,Hash House A Go Go,3,"First of all, there's usually a wait here, but if you go the bar and there's seating available-you get to skip the line. Might be worth putting your name down, and head over to the bar. Then order the BLT Bloody Mary and see if someone gets up from the bar while you're there and take their seats all whilst skipping the line. Ordered two of their famous dishes, sage fried chicken and waffles, and the sage fried chicken with scrambled eggs, mozzarella, tomato, spinach all on biscuits drizzled with a chipotle cream sauce. We probably could've ordered one dish and both been full, but we got greedy and ordered one of each. It's food overload for real.  I enjoyed it visually but eating it was a mediocre experience. There was a lot going on on the plate, the flavors were discombobulated but I have to say the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Service was super friendly though.  Not sure I'd go back, but was ok to check out at least once!"
5345,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I didn't have a fat Tuesday before I got here. So I was kind of sad. It was 11:30 and we got seated after a 20 minute wait. Not as bad as I thought it would be. 

We ordered 1. ) Corn Beef Hash: side potatoes are dry. But corn beef was juicy with the cheese and the eggs were perfectly over medium.

2.) I can't remember. lol. But I just know this is worth trying and maybe next time I'll actually try it for what it is famous for. LOL."
5346,Hash House A Go Go,3,"WEIRDEST TASTING ASPARAGUS EVER.

But I'll get to that later.  

It had been a long day of driving, with a long night of drinking still ahead of me.  I was definitely looking forward to some artery-clogging goodness.  And what better way is there to prepare for a night of drinking than stuffing some fried chicken down your gullet?  

My friend and I split the sage fried chicken and waffles, and we found that people were not exaggerating...the portions were HUGE.   I think it would have been the perfect amount for three people, but for two it was a bit much.  The waffles were delicious; they had bacon cooked right into them, and the slight chewiness and sweetness of the waffle complimented the greasy saltiness of the bacon quite well.  The chicken was good, but I was a little disappointed that I couldn't really taste the sage.  

My other friend opted for the corned beef hash, which was also huge (though not as huge as our tower of chicken & waffles).  I tried some of the corned beef, and it was rather tasty.  Honestly I can't remember much else about his dish, other than...the asparagus.

Now, none of us held any illusions about the type of food this place served.  If it wasn't deep friend, it was covered in butter and/or salt.  Being a sucker for grease and salt, that was just fine by me.  However, we didn't expect the deep-frying madness to extend to the 2 or 3 skinny stalks of asparagus tucked in the side of the skillet.

(Deep fried asparagus and the Spanish inquisition: two things you never expect.)

Oddly enough, they weren't greasy.  Or crispy.  And oddest of all was that they tasted absolutely nothing at all like asparagus.  Actually, they didn't even really taste like food.  After thinking about it for a while, my friend declared that it tasted like overcooked toothpaste.  I believe that was a pretty accurate description.

This place isn't gourmet fare, but it does hit the spot when you want some comfort food. And how many other restaurants can claim to serve the most terrible (and bizarre) asparagus that you'll ever eat?"
5347,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excessive. Just effin excessive.

Hash House is the comfort food equivalent of watching Wipeout or maybe motorboating a generously proportioned woman.  Its... extreme.  Fried Chicken, on a biscuit, on mashed potatoes with a chipotle cream sauce poured over the whole thing.  Yes. Really. For serious.  

And unless you can make a Ryan's buffet manager cry, you'll need to share.  The portions are GUT BUSTING.  We're talking 4 waffles with two fried chicken breasts on top here.  The table next to us ordered the hammered pork tenderloin, and I seriously thought it was a fried doormat. Insane.

Ate here every morning I could in Vegas.  You might regret Hash House an hour later, but you won't forget the experience... and you'll go again given half the chance."
5348,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow!!! Get ready for HUGE portions!!  Make sure not to over do it, share!!!  But the food is really tasty too, so you can't lose.  Order some awesome Bloody Mary's.  Service was really great at the bar, my gf and I had a great time.  Good place!"
5349,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food! The wait was quick and everyone super friendly. PJ was the best server we've had on our trip so far and made great recommendations. He was super friendly and fun to joke around with. He's terrible at guessing names, so give the guy a break and lie about your name LOL I kid, he was awesome. The Andy's fried chicken was delicious and my friend wanted a vat of the sauce! Seriously good. We had the 20oz mimosas and they were perfect--get the Aloha one! Sooo good! I had the corned beef hash which was good but omg the portions are intense! So much food. Come hungry!

*photo was from after we started eating--seriously so much food! So good!"
5350,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great, unique good. LARGE portions. Long wait so prepare yourself. Semi-slow service d/t them being so busy. Didn't enjoy the chicken and waffles as much as I thought. Also the bathrooms being downstairs sucks lol."
5351,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Lived up to the hype! The huge portions can feed 2 people. So they charge if you want to share. But they tell u to just order a side of eggs or fries etc instead to make up the charge. I guess I can cross out Hash House A Go Go off my ""Man vs. Food"" checklist."
5352,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Large portions for a reasonable price. Not amazing food, but it was good and exactly what we needed after drinking all night. This place is definitely a must for drunken nights and hangovers."
5353,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Warning: Another reason why I miss San Diego!

I like this Hash House a go-go conveniently located on the Las Vegas Blvd strip on the second-floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. 

I like the bigger venue of this HH Las Vegas location with no wait in the morning. 

I like the later closing hours at 11pm.

There is a full-service bar. 

There is Keno and a big screen television for sporting events.  

But the food tasted like any other casino's diner. If not, worst than the San Diego's Hillcrest location. 

For $16.95, I had the Crispy Hammered Pork Tenderloin. The dish had a long piece of a crispy Pork cutlet on top of a biscuit, BBQ cream sauce, scrambled eggs, tomato and spinach. 

My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=FRWIO4KonJv9o279SsyKag

This is a very big dish, but the dish's taste-wise was just ok. Like I aforementioned, it tasted like an overpriced casino food. 

I also had $6.00 glass of Mimosa. At least, they used freshly squeezed OJ along with champagne in this drink. 

My drink: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=TH5sj4h8eY8RxZPgzzphIQ

I still love San Diego's location and food much better. But Las Vegas has two other locations. Unfortunately, this touristy part of LV is not my favorite. 

On the bright side, I might return again and maybe redeem myself and try something else instead."
5354,Hash House A Go Go,1,"We went to the Sahara location. Not what I expected! My order arrived 4 minutes after my husbands plate was served. My food was slightly warm, but I ate it anyway, since I had waited so long. There was supposed to be Brie cheese in my eggs, there wasn't anything. The mashed potatoes were good, but they were cold too.
I was told a biscuit was on its way fresh out of the oven. I was half way done with my breakfast when it arrived & it was cold, so much for out of the oven!  The prices are high, considering the mistakes that were made, we will never go back. Especially since nothing was done about the mistakes."
5355,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We showed up at Hash House A Go Go early one evening hungover and ready for some delicious brunch. Unfortunately we hadn't gotten out of the house early enough to make it in time for breakfast/lunch and could only order off the dinner menu. We were starving and had a hell of a time getting to Imperial Palace in the first place so we decided to stay and check it out. 

We were well aware of their HUGE portions so we ordered the Slow Cooked Bar B' Que Pork Ribs on a bed of horseradish potato salad from the ""Just 4 grazing"" section of the menu and the Boston Hash (Crispy potatoes, mixed onions, fresh tomatoes all crowned with Andy's famous all blue crab cake drizzled with horseradish cream and served with scrambled eggs) from the ""Late Breakfast"" section.  I would have liked the horseradish cream to be a little spicier to give the dish more of a kick. There was more than enough food to feed the both of us and we brought a small box home of leftovers. 

As my career is geared towards pastries I am often browsing the dessert menu even on a full stomach just to see what's available. We decided to share a double shot of espresso poured over a very large scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream. MMM this was my favorite part of the meal! 


The restaurant itself was pretty empty. Our server was genuine and nice. It definitely could have been worse ;) Overall I enjoyed the experience and would definitely go again."
5356,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So... Much... Food... 
Honestly, I write this while attempting to digest 1/3 of the food that was on my plate. Come here hungry and willing to share. The food is beyond plentiful and delicious, and reasonably priced considering one meal could serve a small army. Also, Monday's are half priced bottles of select wine."
5357,Hash House A Go Go,2,"waited forever to get seated alomost an hour, then when the hour was up, they wanted us to wait another hour...SIKE..not happening.  so when we decided we were leaving, mysteriously there was a open table.  Got seated and there were open tables everywhere.  Ordered the food, but it took so long, I was no longer hungry.  We ordered our food at the same time, but it came out at different times.  Plus the food was cold.  Definately will not be back....."
5358,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is a hidden gem!! The portions are huge and the price is just right so come with a empty stomach, had the pancakes and eggs. You can't go wrong with anything you get you'll get your money's worth. Wife had the chicken and waffles said it was great just too much food!!"
5359,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love this place... you have to get the Chicken and Waffles. Yum!
5360,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing to say the least. I love the Cornbeef hash that they have! Orange juice was fantastic, and the service was good too. 

WARNING : It will take a while for you to get sat ( 30-45 minutes ) if you go during busy times. So popular that wait times are long, guess that says something about the food! Lol 3rd time going, always pleased."
5361,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They call it 'Twisted Farm Food' and they're not kidding around. The portions are ginormous and the food is ridiculously delicious! Each dish is big enough to share amongst two people so unless you're super hungry, I would recommend sharing. 

This place is a hidden gem inside the dinky Imperial Palace. For brunch, we ordered the Man Vs. Food favorite, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It looked like a scrumptious heart attack served on a platter. It came with perfectly scrambled eggs, crispy fried chicken (a tad on the salty side), thick slices of smoked bacon, slices of tomatoes, a sprinkle of fresh spinach, a heaping amount of mashed potatoes, and a light flaky biscuit all smothered in their chipotle cream sauce with a stick of rosemary on top. Typically, I don't like it when everything is mixed together, but it was so good we cleaned the plate! We also got their Snickers Flapjacks, which was the size of a medium pizza! It tasted like a chocolate chip pancake - not too shabby.

Thanks Hash House for clogging my arteries with fried food heaven. I'll definitely be coming back!"
5362,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Went here in may for my birthday. Waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated. 

I got the chicken and waffles and my girl got the standard bacon and eggs. We both also had some caramel espresso drink that was awesome and huge. 

Our server was nice but kind of inattentive. It took about 25-30 minutes to get our food but it was well worth the wait. 

The portions at this place are INSANE. you can easily split one meal between 2 or 3 people. We probably would have only ordered one meal if we had known but it was our first time. 

The bacon and eggs my girl ordered were great. She ate maybe 15% of the food they gave her. 

The chicken and waffles were amazing. Crispy chicken that was flavorful and juicy on the inside. The waffles were light and fluffy and to top it off there was bacon cooked in the middle! My inky complaint would be that there wasn't enough syrup lol. 

We left ridiculously full and happy. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a huge meal that tastes amazing but won't break the bank(in Vegas at least. Lol). 

I'll definitely be back next time I'm in sin city!

I can only hope that they open one here in Portland!"
5363,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Man oh man! 

We stayed in the Linq our last night in Vegas and decided to check out Hash House for a late night dinner. 

We walked over expecting them to be closed as it was 11:30 at night. Nope, this place is open 24 hours a day! If I had to rate this place solely on the customer service from the hostess, they'd have 1 star but luckily everything else was Top notch! 

Our server, was amazing! She knew the food and beverage menu and answered any questions we had. Without looking at the menu, I asked her what drink I should have and she recommended the Watermelon Kiwi Spiked Punch, yum! It was super refreshing! Next was food, we ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and the Sage Fried Chicken Benny! The portions are HUGE, one plate would have filled us both up. We had a ton of leftovers. Both dishes were fantastic, I loved the chicken. Super juicy and full of fantastic flavors. 

If you're in Vegas, be sure to stop in! It's definitely a must have :)"
5364,Hash House A Go Go,2,"""corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, artificial flavors, citric acid, potassium sorbate, xantham gum"" are the ingredients for the ""maple syrup"" they serve.  They should train their servers to not call it maple as there is not an ingredient that resembles maple.

We should expect more when a place claims ""farm fresh"" and such.  This is a run of the mill boil in a bag place with a gimmecky give you a huge portion that is just waste.  SO much food waste from this place & even styrofoam to go containers.  This is what is wrong with our country and how we eat.

It is even loud, crowded and service was meh.

If you frequent the Claim Jumper or TGIF places you will like this poor food quality chain.  I've been in LV for three years now and this was my first / probably my last trip to Hash House."
5365,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great service great flavor big portions for the price, for lighter eater its 2 meals... me and my bf shared and still had left over."
5366,Hash House A Go Go,5,This place is AMAZING! Absolutely worth the wait. The portions are large and definitely enough to take home for a whole nother meal. Would highly recommend.
5367,Hash House A Go Go,4,"never disappoints and always hits the spot, love their chicken and waffles and the extra large pancakes!!!"
5368,Hash House A Go Go,5,I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. It hit the spot. I like their food. I wish their portions were smaller. I have to share because I can't possibly eat that much.
5369,Hash House A Go Go,2,"From a foodie's perspective, this is a glamourized Denny's diner with reason price and enormous portion that is sickening. I've heard about hash a gogo from the travel channel and recommendation from friends. Nothing fancy, but quite ghetto there. There's no windows and i fell so contained. My banana latte was generous in size and was decent, but tad too sweet. 

These platters are about 1 feet long by 6 inches that could be shared by 3 people! It's all about quantity over quality. 

Sage fried chicken - First couple bites were good until you devour more.. the platter has too much sauce going on that it no longer looks appetizing once you start eating it..I mean visually unappetizing with brown tan sauce over the chicken mashed with the herbs...

Chicken waffles - Chicken is your typical fried chicken, which could be juicier... Waffle is your typical average waffle. It's soo enourmous that it covers my head and top part of my 5'4 body frame. It's wayy too much carb. 

Overall, quality of flavor is quite lacking here..."
5370,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yum - you won't be disappointed and you won't leave hungry! I had the meatloaf hash - really good.
5371,Hash House A Go Go,4,"General comfort food on crack.  Nothing fancy but a solid hangover cure.
 You would need to run a marathon to finish a plate by yourself.  Each plate could probably serve 4 people at normal portion rates."
5372,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is a must-go if you're in Vegas! Theyre famous for their Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, which I got and it was delicious! Unfortunately, the chicken was a little on the dry side but it was still very good overall. We also tried the brown sugar banana pancake, and holy cow, it was everything we wanted in a pancake. Incredible flavor and so fluffy. 

I gave this place four stars because our waitress was a little rude and didn't pay much attention to us. But looking around, the other staff members seemed to take good care of their customers!"
5373,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is a must stop every time I go to Las Vegas. The building entrance to the restaurant is in the back of the casino, up an escalator. The place has a country vibe to it, with a little bit of class. Best to get their early, because there might be a bit of a wait. They warn you ahead of time that the proportions are large, so you may want to get something for two (if it's your first time (wink)). I do recommend their number one item, Fried Chicken and Waffles. This massive stack will have you mouth watering, and your gut wanting to take the challenge. You're a better man or woman if you could complete this stack of fried goodness. I've also tried the stuffed burgers, which I can complete, mostly. I'm a fan of the blue cheese stuffed burger. I do love their massive egg dishes, and Bloody Marys. Don't try to complete the entire meal. Bring some home, be happy when you get home drunk."
5374,Hash House A Go Go,5,"When a place gets a FIVE STAR review from me it is rare, and well deserved. I'm quick to tell you about the bad places because you should be warned I know the value of a dollar, and the good places youll find out about yourself but I loved this place so much, it would make so much money in Los Angeles. Well here it is... HUUUUGEEEE portions, I couldn't finish.. and I ALWAYS finish everything on my plate, always.. I was dying with deliciousness.. Bacon stuffed waffles and fried chicken. They tell you when they take your order; everything is freshly made so the order might take a while to cook. It was the fastest meal I was ever served. And the price to portion size to taste ratio was wonderful were talking 1:3:5.. Will definitely go back and only wished I went here sooner instead of the day we were leaving. Note: get the cucumber ranch dressing to dip the chicken in.. Bomb! Only thing I didn't like was the sage stick hanging out the chicken, in the way and not my favorite flavor but hey, just ask for no plants and you're good :D
IN MY OPINION:  this would be my final meal... 5 stars!"
5375,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Lots of great comfort food on the menu.  The inside has been recently redone and looks great.   I had the corned beef and hash.  The corn beef was pulled, and very tender.  Had lots of cheese, but was very good.  The chicken and waffles is outrageous, go for it, that's what I'm trying next time."
5376,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Pancakes were good and breakfast bacon was on point. Service was great. Long line for breakfast, however the line moves relativly fast. Hotel was under construction and no clear signs on where to go but that is not the fault of the restaurant. other than that GR8 Place to get your vittles."
5377,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HUGE Portions !!

The Burgers are Huge & all Stuffed, Can Feed 2PPL 4Sure.
 Breakfast was Good esp the Biscuits & Gravy !! 
Chicken & Bacon Waffles were yummy too!

Fun Place 2 Eat & Laugh at How Huge everything is !!"
5378,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food here was delicious and the portions are HUGE! Great place to go, very modern, and clean. You really get what you paid for. I would recommend this place to anyone who craves a big dish. Also, their pancakes are almost bigger than the plates."
5379,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I read the reviews and thought wow this place is going to be great! Boyyyy was I wrong.. when we walked in we were ignored and then were finally sat about 5 minutes later.. there wasn't a line. It was just my husband and I. The hostess took us to an 8 top table? When we sat down she said, is this a little large for you? I said, do u have anything else? She said no.. even though there were small booths everywhere. She then backtracked and came back to the table and decided to tell us we can move you.. blah blah blah. I said, no it's fine. Our waitress took a solid 15 minutes or more to greet us. Once we were greeted she brought us water and told us the drink specials but never asked if we wanted anything to drink. I ordered the fried eggs Benedict. It was over cooked and cold. And so was my husbands and the couple sitting next to us. I had to ask the manger for a drink, and then she never even noticed that we didn't eat our food. We asked for our check from another server and left. $70. Bad service, bad food and will never return."
5380,Hash House A Go Go,1,"THIS LOCATION STINKS!!! Let me tell you why...

Our kids love exploring the different casinos, and Imperial Palace is one even I had not been in to, now I know why.  The parking garage was gross, inside the casino was old and dirty, then upstairs in the Hash House it all looks good, but we soon found out it was not!

There were NO amazing Honey Biscuits, there was a 30 minute wait for the food, when it arrived it all lacked flavor... WHAT?  This cannot be the Hash House I love?  UGH!!

I have been to the West Sahara and also the M Resort locations, received amazing service and food PACKED with flavor, so go try those, but by all means AVOID the Imperial Palace location!!

They were even shooting a commercial, and WERE NOT BUSY, so I thought this would be a great experience, but it was terrible, and even after talking to the staff, nobody cared!

My recommendations at other locations:
Blue Crab Cake Hash- awesome crab cakes!!!
Famous Meatloaf Pasta- WOW good!
Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower
The Tractor Driver Combo

I like the Hash House A Go Go, fun atmosphere and fun food, just
STAY AWAY FROM THE IMPERIAL PALACE LOCATION....
seriously!!"
5381,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Service was great, the portions are huge so come very hungry or be split with some one! Food was excellent had the chicken Benedict. Bloody Mary was good as well!"
5382,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Such unusual and fun food. It's deli ious and made for a huge appetite. I got the Bunless portablo mushroom sandwich  with a side salad while I envied everyone else's plate. I had delicious bites of fries chicken, fried green onions and waffles. Delish. If you are on a diet, get the portable Li. It's great too."
5383,Hash House A Go Go,5,Chicken and Waffles is off the chain! Check it out! They are amazing place to eat plus Happy Hour too!
5384,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Such a fun place to go to in Vegas! It is a chain but the food and portions are insane! 

The wait times can be extremely long so get there early but even if you have to wait the food is worth it and you will not be disappointed! 

They have great drink deals which are huge as well!

When I went I ordered the crab cakes Benedict (picture below) and it was amazing! It was served on a bed of mashed potatoes so honestly what could be better? 

The staff is friendly and very attentive! If you are looking for good food this is your place! 

You will not leave hungry and you will have left overs for days!"
5385,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had the chicken and waffles and they were FANTASTIC! My friends said the scrambles they got were average so maybe avoid those. The wait was excruciating though; make sure you have lots of time to wait and then lots of time afterward to recover, the portions are huge. Overall, I would definitely recommend and I am definitely returning on my next trip."
5386,Hash House A Go Go,4,"INSANE portions, almost comedic. Lol. And the price is pretty cheap too for the amount of food you get. Service was great but took us about an hour to get our food. Food tasted great. Mojito was small, full of ice and kinda pricy so I don't recommend getting that drink, but everything else looked great. Be prepared to wait a bit at the front door. 10-15 minutes for us."
5387,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent! Big portions and plenty to bring home! Had the Caesar chicken salad and an outstanding Bloody Mary! Probably the best one I have ever had! Husband had the stuffed meatloaf. Also excellent. The service was outstanding. Very pleased with this place and can't wait to come back! Looking around at all the plates going to the Other tables is fun! All huge portions!
5388,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was outstanding!  I had the Sage Chicken and Waffles.  Really good.  The only criticism was that it seems that they used a cheap syrup.  Too bad really.  I asked for some syrup to go and they were Log Cabin containers, which confirmed that it wasn't a top shelf real Maple.  The chicken was out of the world, and the bacon in the waffles just nailed it.

My wife had a corned beef hash and it was just lovely.  They under cooked the over easy eggs, but that is so darned common, I can't give them a hard time about it.  

Menu: 5 Stars. Off the charts.

Ambience: 3 Stars.  A little rugged and run down, but fits it's in your face style.

Service: 3 Stars.  Too many mistakes.  They bring your food as it comes up, that means my wife was almost done with her meal by the time I got mine.  The waiter didn't write anything down so when he brought me the wrong dish the first time, it wasn't surprise.   I saw my waiter every 10 minutes.  Had to get up and go to the waiter station to ask for water.  To make all this better, they were running their butts off and rectified every mistake quickly and cheerfully.  I feel it is more of a management issue than anything.

I will go back next time in Vegas.  I have yet to have a breakfast of this caliber in Vegas."
5389,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My boyfriend and I heard from a friend that this is a must try place when you're in vegas. We went on a Tuesday because we heard during the weekend it can be quite hectic with a reallly long wait. We only waited for about 20-30min, the food and service was great. I would definitely come here if you are extremely hungry because the portions are huge!"
5390,Hash House A Go Go,5,We went on a Sunday about 9:15 about a 10 min wait so a great start.  Very pleasant and helpful staff made some recommendations on what was popular. We had the corned beef hash with a side of gravy for the biscuit and the fried chicken Benedict. A absolutely incredible breakfast one of my all time favorites. We had enough food for about 4 people huge portions and a great bloody mary.
5391,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you can, get here before 11 am to avoid the long wait.  We got here late 9'ish and when we left, the whole entire upstairs was packed with people waiting to be seated.  Having arrived before the lunch crowd, we were immediately seated.  Service was prompt and we had drinks ordered and brought out pretty quick.  

Being it was morning time, we were given the breakfast menu I presume since I didn't see any of the lunch or dinner plates listed on their website.  The menu is pretty extensive and our server was keen enough to suggest that she'd give us an extra couple of minutes to look it over.  I did ask when she returned what she recommended or what was the most commonly ordered plate.  With a little snooty-ness and, I guess, pride, she commented everything was good on the menu and all their plates were made in their own unique way.  The statement was something to the effect of, ""we may have dishes that's commonplace such as chicken pot pie, but when you have our chicken pot pie, it's nothing like any chicken pot pie that you've ever had.""  Okay... I wasn't expecting that, but I'll take her word for it.  She did finish saying the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and the griddled french toast were popular.  

Ultimately, after going back and forth up and down the menu, we ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=GLQSZ-UG8v_K61ony2y45Q the Smoked Salmon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=_EB015nkHl9bQ57549bSFQ the Tractor Driver http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=K2eFMfxtq6QP5E-fawN3nA cause it sounded cool and the Farmer's Daughter http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I0j--YuQ8lg-ttvGuloyng since it sounded cute.

Okay, I'll give our server her pride in the food that Hash House makes since it was all well presented, very plentiful and quite delicious!  Everything from the salmon, to the crispy potatos, to the fried chicken, to the griddled french toast in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup (my absolute favorite!) was made exceptionally well.  It was all quite impressive and I guess you can ""church it up"" by sticking a strand of rosemary into a biscuit.  Btw, that biscuit was good, but it was heavy and dense enough to be a paper weight.  Coffee was pretty good tasting for an average cup of joe as well.

Portions were large and if your appetite and stomach can munster finishing everything on your plate, then you can forego your next meal.  We skipped out on lunch after have a late breakfast (saved some money that way) and we walked it off by strolling the strip and seeing the sights afterwards.  Just remember, get there early before lunch or earlier for dinner and hopefully you won't have to put up with the long wait."
5392,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great food! Huge potions. I gave it only 4 Stars because they don't take reservations on the weekend!
5393,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Big on portions, not so much on taste.

I ordered their popular Sage Fried Chicken with Bacon Waffles. Presentation wise...it was awesome. Until i took that first bite of the chicken...omg DRY DRY DRY. It was also flavorless. And the Waffles, lets just say I had to order a side of extra maple syrup & butter to bring it to life. Slightly disappointed, but glad I came to see what the hype is all about.

Coconut Mango pancakes were pretty good though. Will prob return to try other items on their menu

I left with pants unbuttoned. Cool, time to hit up the pool."
5394,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Love it here every time. The service is always great, atmosphere is homey, and the food is always awesome. I recently got their 14oz steak and it was perfect. Can't wait to come back next time!"
5395,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've been here 4 times, each time has gotten worse and worse with the food.  Came here during late night. It was dead, dead, dead. That's fine, because I chose coming here over waiting in the in and out line.

Well our server Roy was good. The food was blah. I ordered the corned beef. It was chewy and had no flavor at all. It mentioned red onions, didn't find any at all. There were raw bell peppers chopped on top and white or yellow onions used, and green onion. The potatoes underneath weren't crisp. The biscuit was old.

Everything was warming to cold. The biscuit was sitting in a puddle of corned beef juices. That was real meaty tasting... and soggy. It's like a shit was not given at all. The cast iron the food was served in, was hotter than the food that came out. How depressing. 

Never got a water refill either."
5396,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh mi gosh I been here before and had pancakes. Today I tried the Chicken and Waffles I would seriously drive from California just to have them again.  If you don't know what to get, get the chicken and waffles. You will not be disappointed."
5397,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG, Not only is the food delicious,  no matter what you oder the food is off the chain. They give you so much food that one entre is enough for 3 to 4 people, for real. Their meatloaf delish, potpie never seen anything like it. There not one thing the week have ever ordered that has been a disappointment.  Go with a big appetite,  even with that I bet you won't be able to finish you food. Thank goodness for doggie bag. The waiters are very knowledgeable and helpful. Enjoy the experience."
5398,Hash House A Go Go,4,I'm only giving this a four because it took so long with my food. I ordered a simple breakfast eggs & chicken sausage & it was the best chicken sausage ever!! My friend had chicken hash - how chicken could be hash I didn't know but it was great!! Will def go back next trip in Vegas!
5399,Hash House A Go Go,1,"ZERO stars!!! The WOREST experience of my entire life! We were told the wait for a table of 8 was 10 minutes. The table was available it just needed to be cleaned. 10 minutes to clean a table? Fine, sounds reasonable, until 10 minutes turned to 40 minutes. The table for 8 sat in front of us untouched for over 30 MINUTES! Every time we asked the host to check on our table we were met with attitude. He could not be bothered to lift a finger, to even turn around!!! The place was not BUSY!!!!!!!!  We literally watched them slowly clean this table over the next 30 minutes! And then another 10 minutes for him to seat us...Literally the WORST HOST I have ever dealt with in my life.  Despite the food, I would NEVER come back here again! NEVER!"
5400,Hash House A Go Go,5,"There isn't a bad thing to say about this place. The place was packed and the wait was only 30 minutes which is great, and the service was fantastic. We shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and still couldn't finish it. The portions are huge and price is fantastic. It's a must try! I will be back!"
5401,Hash House A Go Go,5,We go to Hash House every time we are in Vegas!  It's one of the highlights of our trip! Kye & Sassy are beyond fabulous.  I could wax poetically on & on!  Rick & Danica Wiles
5402,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The chicken and waffles here is always perfect. Definitely a place you want to go visit before leaving Vegas, truly amazing."
5403,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Oh my goodness. The banana pancake, the fried chicken Benedict, the bacon waffle, eggs, potatoes...all of it was amazing. We all tasted each other's and approved. Definitely listen to the servers...they know what they are talking about. The strawberry lemonade margarita and the aloha royal mimosa were delicious!"
5404,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What!!!!!! Awesome, great tasting food. This wonderful place really needs to be in one of the swankier casinos, but kind of feels right in the 
IP. The portions are absolutely gigantic. We came to this place because we saw it on Man vs. Food. Adam was right; this place is cool, not overpriced like a lot of LV, and YUMMY. We ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, mash potatoes w/ bacon and cheddar, and a salad. It was too much food for 2 people. The chicken and waffles were so good, and full of flavor. And bacon cooked right in the waffle!!!  It was totally what my bf and I were craving. The potatoes could have been an entree alone. They were covered with cheesy goodness and everything is good with bacon. The salad was great as well, but not really needed since we ordered so much food."
5405,Hash House A Go Go,5,Unbelievable chicken and waffles! Portions are huge and food is yummy! Come hungry and ready to eat. This location is always crowded since it's right near strip. I recommend a reservation or try another one of their locations a little further off the strip if you can't get a table!
5406,Hash House A Go Go,4,Love Hash House a GoGo for a good breakfast worth the wait and the $$. Love the Machaca for breakfast and they have good coffee too. Great pancakes (they are huge the size of a large dinner plate). Come hungry and leave happy
5407,Hash House A Go Go,4,Stopped by after our Mat Franco show. I'd suggest sharing a plate. Portions are pretty big! My boyfriend and I split the chicken and waffles and were full. The table next to us got a plate each and they laughed about how they were never going to finish.
5408,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My bf and I walked here after we found out that BB Kings charges 10 bucks for their breakfast special of 2 eggs, hash browns and a biscuit. Uh yeah, no thanks.

So, it's located on the 2nd floor at the Imperial Palace. Trying to find the hostess stand in this clusterf*ck of people is ridiculous. The stand need to be moved to the entrance to the restaurant, not set back halfway into the lobby. 

The server was nice, but perhaps a little overwhelmed. The one thing that I noticed here is that the servers didn't really help out any table but their own. Not much teamwork. For example, I sat with an empty glass of iced tea while the waitress at the next station filled empty glasses for her customers and walked right past our table with a half-full pitcher of tea. Nice. 

I ordered the blue cheese burger which was okay. The meat was dry and not juicy as I had hoped. It was massive, that's for sure and they brush the top of the bun with butter or oil, which makes it really slippery and hard to handle. My bf had the tractor combo with a blackberry granola pancake. He said that it was average. 

My main complaint here, I think, is the massive amounts of wasted food. Seriously, why does every plate need a whole sprig of rosemary? I get the whole presentation thing, but c'mon. I would rather have smaller portions and be charged less, but that's just me."
5409,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Maybe it was the hype, maybe it was the alcohol, but this place sure didnt meet my expectations. With the hype on Man vs Food and being insanely hungry, I was looking forward to trying out this establishment.

I ordered the Sage's Fried Chicken which comes with two eggs, mash potatoes and a biscuit. First off, the portions are HUGE. I would recommend sharing for sure but they have a split plate charge of $3 so i recommend ordering a side of something.  

The fried chicken was forgettable. It was dry, bland and had no flavor at all. I ended up using ketchup and tabasco on the chicken to eat it. It was quite greasy and the batter was sweet? Probably some maple in the batter but i didn't care for it. If there was some salt, then maybe. It was too late by the time it got to the table to add salt since it wouldn stick to the crust.  Potatoes were decent cause it had bits and pieces of bacon in it. Biscuit was soft and decent. Best part of the dish?  Fresh melon and pineapple

sorry hash house, it was all hype to me."
5410,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We have been to two Vegas locations, and the food and service is consistently good. Nice drink menu, with good beer choices. Portions are huge, and their renowned chicken and waffles is great- it does have sage. I wanted more of a vibe to go with the fun name, but overall I got the same experience as an Applebee's with higher-end ingredients. You can join their club and get a coupon for a free birthday meal, which is nice."
5411,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The Hash House located inside The Linq is a must!! My past 3 visits to Vegas had this place on my list. The food is awesome! I highly recommend ""the basic"" for a huge, fresh, & delicious breakfast! The pancakes are also the size of a medium pizza! Check it out"
5412,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here on a Monday morning with three of my cousins. Two of them ordered as simple breakfast with eggs potatoes, bacon and a biscuit and the other had bread. The other cousin ordered 2 eggs over easy with bacon and a vanilla waffle , and I ordered the blue Crab Sandwich with fries. When I I tell you my Crab sandwich was huge!!! Usually if you were to get crab cakes somewhere they charge you 16+ for 2 small sized cakes with no sides!!! Here I got a whole sandwich with a cd sides crab cake with fries for $16.99. It was filling enough that I only ate half. My 2 cousins who got the simple breakfast plates (I can't remember the name of it) their only complaint was the potatoes. Because they are all different cuts, some weren't cooked all the way, and they didn't like how they were prepared, fried a bit. there takeaway is this places focuses on the main dishes.... and not so much on the simple plates.  Did it live up to the hype???? Ehh not soo much, but it was satisfactory"
5413,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Large portions! Either come with the appetite of an elephant or share a dish! We ordered the famous Triple Ds Benedict . I swapped out the scrambled eggs with sunny-side up eggs because a benedict to me needs the yolky goodness. Fried chicken, bacon, tomato, spinach all sit on top of biscuits and mashed potatoes and smothered in a chipotle hollandaise. The sauce was the star of the dish that binded everything together. I enjoyed the mashed potatoes more than the dense biscuits.

I would definitely come back again to try their array of dishes. 5 stars to the staff for putting up with the rambunctious crowd. For a party of 8, our wait was around 45 minutes at 11:30 am so try to go early if possible!"
5414,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We came here based on great reviews on Yelp. To our dismay, the taste of the food was awful. The Benedict i ordered was in such a huge portion that I only ate 1/4 of it. 
With the same price we were able to get ourselves food from other restaurants that were much better quality and just enough in terms of quantity. We expected a nice and refreshing brunch, instead we got huge platters that were larger than Texas (yes they don't even serve this much in Texas). What really disappointed me was the service and the wait. Although it's understandable that getting late to any Vegas restaurants will most likely result in long wait, we did not expect 30 minutes of waiting for an available table, 10 minutes of waiting for the waiter come to get our order after we got our table, 40 minutes of waiting for food to come, and 20 more minutes for the waiter to handle our checkout, on top of that, our waiter did not even ask if we needed to refill our water ONCE (my glass was already empty by the time I got through 1/4 of my platter). 
To be honest, if you are starving and haven't eaten for 2 days, this restaurant is great for you. Otherwise, you can definitely find better restaurants that serve more refreshing food that are around the same price or even cheaper than Hash House A Full Full."
5415,Hash House A Go Go,4,Ate here for the first time over the Thanksgiving holiday.  Went for breakfast and shared the Andy's sage fried chicken benedict and the meatloaf hash.  I loved the benedict.  It was a huge mess of delicious flavors that worked better than I expected.  The meatloaf hash was boring for my taste.  It was just large chunks of meatloaf on top of fried potatoes.  I gues if you are not an adventurous eater this would be fine.  The service was fantastic.  The waiter even mentioned that we should order a side dish to avoid the split plate charge.  I don't mind split plate charges but I prefer when there are inexpensive ways to avoid them...lol
5416,Hash House A Go Go,2,Go to one of the other locations in town or be sure to give them a really unique name for the waiting list.  We got skipped and wound up waiting FOREVER before I asked only to discover we were two pages back.  The food was amazing as always but overall experience was soured by watching everyone else go before us.  Recommendation though - you have to get the brown sugar banana pancakes.  They are unbelievable and the reason we didn't bail on the ridiculously long wait.
5417,Hash House A Go Go,4,Amazing chicken and waffles!!!  One order can definitely accommodate 2-3 people easily.  I will come again because I leave.
5418,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The portions are huge, but I wouldn't you rather have a normal portion of delicious food than a gargantuan portion of acceptable food? I know I would.

The salads are cheap, with that gross kind of nearly white lettuce and pale cherry tomatoes. The hashes are far better at the HH in San Diego.

I don't think smoking is allowed in the restaurant, but it smells like smoke and my eyes started to sting while I was there. All in all, a pretty disappointing experience."
5419,Hash House A Go Go,5,Love hash house a go go!! The portions are huge so I would definitely recommend sharing. I like the tractor trailer combo because it comes with a taste of all the basics. The wait is usually long but if you have a platinum or higher total rewards card you get seated immediately. This is our new Vegas breakfast spot!
5420,Hash House A Go Go,5,Once again I was not disappointed in Hash House A Go Go.  The bacon was so good I ordered an extra side of it and my brown sugar banana flapjack was amazing. The service was great and the food was awesome. We will be back.
5421,Hash House A Go Go,4,"three full grown men shared two plates.  and we had some togo. 

The fried chicken is decliious. the most crispy buttery tasy chicken i ever bit into.  the taste is more asian however.  tasted more like garlic soysauce Korean pub fried chicken. But still it wad fried perfectly and delicious. 

we also had the meat loaf hash.  the meat loaf was really tender and juicy but it just didnt hasve enough flavor to it.  ketchup needed."
5422,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I have eaten at their other location in Las Vegas. It was nothing less that delicious. That time I had the chicken and waffles. A little bit different from how I usually have chicken and waffles, but the sage completely changed the dish for me, for the better. 
This time, I went to the Hash House at the Linq. We had a little trouble looking for it, someone said it was on the second floor, but when we took the elevators there it was just guest rooms. We found the escalator, but we had my infant daughter there in her stroller, with NO elevator access. So we had to bring it up the very narrow escalator. I guess this would be a complaint more about the hotel, which was very smokey compared to any of the other hotels on the strip. Even in the restaurant, the smell was over whelming.
This trip I ordered the meatloaf. We were given a free set of biscuits to try. Excellent! Very buttery and sweet. My food came out and was very good, but the portion was huge. I could not finish it cuz; 1. its was so big and 2. I had a headache from all the smoke. 
Again, I don't think this is the restaurants fault, more of the hotel's issue. The Linq was the Imperial Palace and it appears that they just remolded the outside and not the inside. 
Again, the food was very good, but I would suggest to go eat at the restaurant off the strip. Maybe you should change the location to a different hotel."
5423,Hash House A Go Go,3,Huge portions for a decent price. Expect a long wait because this restaurant has been featured on shows like Man vs. Food. I ordered a spicy grilled chicken sandwich and was definitely disappointed. The chicken was not spicy at all. Definitely an over rated restaurant.
5424,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG where do I start? So my husband and I visited the raved about Hash House A Go Go and we definitely were not disappointed. My husband played it very safe and enjoyed the lemon herb chicken with sauteed green beans and mashed potatoes. I must say his dish was very delicious and flavorful along with the lemon butter sauce that accompanied the half of chicken. Now for me.... I had to go for the gusto and ordered the Sage Friend Chicken and Waffles with fried leeks. Man Oh Man!!! The portions were enough for 2.5 servings. The taste of the crispy fried chicken and crispy leeks were just a hell of a pair.  The waffles were cooked with crispy bacon inside (yummy) and the warm maple syrup. To pour over everything was just simply succulent. My husband and are were super excited to find out there is a location in Plano, TX so we will be planning a mini road trip. You guys have to try this place while in Vegas."
5425,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is GREAT but beware the portions are HUGE!  The prices are great, hubby and I should have shared our biscuits and gravy but he didn't listen to me!  Two large fluffy biscuits topped with yummy gravy exploding with sausage!  He got his with mashed potatoes, I got mine with crispy potatoes, and they were excellent.  I think it was only about $12 to $14 for the biscuits and gravy, which would have been great if we would have shared!  :)  The bloody Mary was just ok, it was pretty bland, I had to keep dumping Tabasco in it.  The food is delicious, everyone enjoyed their meals... Supposedly everything is farm fresh and made from scratch.  Highly recommended, this place will be a definite stop next time we are in Vegas!"
5426,Hash House A Go Go,5,I'm a fan I'm a fan!!! I saw the reviews and it still wasn't what I thought it was gonna be IT WAS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT! SO much tasty food I got the chicken sage and Maggie's crab cake and it was humungus. There biscuit was even goooooood. Our  waiter was the bestest he offered up great selections which we picked. He did a great job! The only thing I didn't like was they have a full service bar with no cognac and the bathroom is downstairs by the Casino. Other than that I'm hitting them back up before I go home
5427,Hash House A Go Go,5,I don't even know where to begin. This restaurant had so many items to choose from it was hard to pick just one menu item. The portions are HUGE so you are definitely getting your monies worth. Very friendly staff. The sage fried chicken stack was exactly how it looks...delicious!
5428,Hash House A Go Go,5,"There was a nice lady in her 60s who took my order and chatted with me while waiting. I really enjoyed talking to her and I wish her all the best. The amazing, ginormous Tractor Driver Combo was scrumptious but it's always the human touch/service that leaves the most lasting impression. Kudos to the staff and the wonderful lady who took my order!"
5429,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My husband and I went here for the first time today and it definitely won't be our last.  The food was amazing!!  I have the corn beef hash and my husband had the Tractor Driver breakfast with Snickers pancakes. Everything was great, including Gabby, our waitress.  We will be back next time we are in Vegas"
5430,Hash House A Go Go,5,Went here with my Honey Bunny and the breakfast was simply amazing. The Apple sausage is to die for
5431,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Definitely not a take out friendly establishment. 

Was staying @ the Flamingo & thought it would be a great idea to order breakfast to bring back to the hotel room. I tried to place a phone order as I made my way to the Linq. Sadly, they do not accept call in orders. When I got there I pretty much felt like a nuisance during my attempt to order at the bar. It took a minimum of 10 minutes to be acknowledged & another 10 for a server or bartender to ring in my food.

After a sizable wait @ 10:20am, the food was boxed well & pretty decent when reconstructing the dishes for consumption. I'm sure the dining experience is much better but I can't speak on it just yet."
5432,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I found this restaurant here on Yelp while looking for a decent brunch spot to visit solo.  This place apparently has made a name for itself on the Vegas Strip because there was a ridiculous wait. When I approached the hostess stand, there seemed to be a lot of confusion as to whether lil' ole me had to sign in and wait 2 hrs or if I could just go over to the bar that clearly had three seats available. After waiting 10 mins, I decided to be a dare devil and just take a seat at the bar against the hostess' direction (no way in heck I was waiting 2hrs by myself). When I sat at the bar, I was immediately greeted by a bartender who directed me to the awesome tropical mimosa on the drink menu. The mimosa was pretty darn tasty and I eventually ordered a second. The menu was extensive so it was kinda difficult to make a decision on one of the many fantastical dishes to try. I finally opted for the hardwood bacon & avocado scramble. As you can see from the photos, the portions here are HUGE so I wasn't able to finish the meal. My food was absolutely scrumptious and all of the other plates I saw come out looked great as well. Overall, it was a great experience but the wait kept it from being a solid five-stars."
5433,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Huge portions, good service, prices were reasonable, but the food was nothing special. We split the chicken and waffles and it just didn't ""pop"" with flavor.  Kudos to the waiter who talked us into splitting a single meal. There was enough food for both of us, and it saved us $10-$15.  We were at KGB (burger place in Harrah's) last year and enjoyed it much more than HHAGG."
5434,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Menu is not accommodating to vegetarians. Service was also poor for making dish customizations for vegetarians. I was surprised that the waiter acted as if he had never met a vegetarian before.

The burger portions were way too large, so if you have guests used to smaller portions (such as those from Europe), avoid Hash House as the overloaded amount of American food is overwhelming.

The only plus is that it's open late.

Recommendation for Hash House:
Be more friendly and accommodating towards vegetarians. Have better menu options for vegetarians or train staff to be better prepared to handle questions about customizing dishes for vegetarians."
5435,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food with huge portions. Price is similar to most vegas restaurants. I went to the one in the Rio and highly recommend it but good luck finishing it all
5436,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Give me Comfort Food in GIANT KING KONG portions and I'm one happy little booger!

Hash House A Go Go should be on your Las Vegas ""EAT LIST"". Come for breakfast, brunch or lunch... you'll leave happy, satisfied and not hungry again for about 24 hours. On top of that, all for an affordable price!

It has a cozy & kinda hip diner feel. The menu is pretty simple and to the point with creative & lip licking options.

Suggestions:

- Burgers

- Pork Sandwich

- Fried Chicken, Biscuit & Egg Mountain!! 

We came...

We ate....

We hurt..

We smiled..

We passed out for a few hours.

How do you do it Man Vs. Food? I smell a cheater.... :)"
5437,Hash House A Go Go,5,"What an AMAZING Restaurant!  We went there for Breakfast on a Monday morning (15 minute wait) as we heard the wait on the weekend was crazy long.  I had the French Toast which is drizzled with maple syrup and bananas foster with glazed walnuts... The meal was enough to feed myself and the BF with no problem at all.  Even better, we had a Restaurant.com coupon.  :-)  The waitress was all business, but really competent.  She gave us the heads up only to order one meal and to share.  Everything that came out of the kitchen was hot and fresh.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.   It will be visited over and over again on our trips to vegas."
5438,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Once again I found myself eating here and my intuition didn't let me down. I decided to go adventurous and force myself to not get my regular tractor driver combo which is certainly salivating, but I was looking to sample something completely different this go 'round. 

I found myself leaning towards the corned beef hash scramble while my other guests went for the basic breakfast and my wife had the tractor combo in the end. I must say their corned beef hash was actually really good. It was the first that I had devoured which had not caused my insides to be overloaded with a salty after taste. I tip my hat to the hash house for that one and all others should take note that corned beef hash doesn't need to be over salted to be bueno!

This was a short review, but what can I say? The service has always been top notch, the food is out of this world, and thank goodness when I come to Vegas I have found a must see for breakfast time and time again!"
5439,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Made the trek past the Dealertainers in the Imperial Palace and up the escalator to HHGG here on the Strip.  It wasn't very busy on a Friday night about 10:00 and we were seated adjacent to the bar. The friendly bartender doubled as our server and brought us a couple hefty drinks.  Having heard about the chicken and waffles, I had no choice... starting with their house salad with a cucumber ranch, I was a little full when the platter of four waffles and two chicken breasts arrived.  Though not a huge fan of waffles in the first place, these babies were cakey and fluffy, and each held a strip of bacon. Not yo mama's Eggo.  The chicken was hot, crispy and flavorful, without a huge amount of breading.  Two waffles and one chicken breast would have been plenty. BF had a fantastic looking burger with two patties, cheddar, bacon, avocado and all the fixings.  Even though our hotel room didn't have a fridge or microwave, I still trotted back a to-go box and took a couple bites in the morning.  Still tasty."
5440,Hash House A Go Go,4,"They are really generous with their servings. Seriously. Their servings are made for giants. One order is good enough for two people. My boyfriend and I thought we could handle the plates, so we got one appetizer and one meal... Definitely only finished 3/4 of it. It got us really stuffed! We really enjoyed the appetizer we got. It didn't even seem like an appetizer at all, more like a meal for one. I forgot what it was called, but it was with angel hair pasta and crab cake. It was something I have never tasted before. It was really delicious!

So delicious, four tables nearby ours ordered it too. I'm not even kidding. One of them, being a party of one, ordered that as his meal alone. Another, was a couple we definitely befriended because we couldn't stop talking about Hash House's food. This couple told us they specifically go to Hash House just for this appetizer! YES, IT'S JUST THAT GOOD. The man ordered it all for himself PLUS another entree, and he ate it all. Unbelievable. Haha.

Just like the couple, I will ALWAYS visit Hash House when I'm in the area just for their angel hair pasta and crab cake. Yum. Oh, and as for the other entree we ordered, it was okay... you can definitely feel the unhealthiness of it as you eat. It made me feel heavy. Angel hair pasta though, that definitely wheeled me in for sure. (:"
5441,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Bar none, best chicken and waffles I have ever had! My family and I came here to eat while in town, and even before leaving the restaurant, I had to write this review. If anyone says this place isn't good, I'll tell you that they are completely wrong. And the portions are enormous!!Yes, for some people, it might be a bit pricy, but what restaurant in Vegas isn't? Overall, could not ask for a better dining experience."
5442,Hash House A Go Go,5,Awesome place - good food - good vibe - good employee - price are great &  BIG FOOD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5443,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you visit Vegas, eating at Hash House is a must for a big appetite. While the wait was about an hour and half, it wasn't surprising considering it was a Saturday afternoon. Our waiter truly made the experience great and had good suggestions throughout. I would recommend one of the many Bloody Mary options they offer and the fried chicken and mashed potatoes were delicious. The only downside was the wait time to get the food, which was at around 50 mins-1 hr."
5444,Hash House A Go Go,3,"fatties not foodies.  excessive amounts instead of quality

tough choice, food was a little bit better than average, the overall service was way less than standard and the atmosphere was not good.
1st.  as would be expected on a Sunday morning, 50 minute wait. Not bad for Vegas.  however, the 40 additional minutes to bring the food is outrageous.  they tell you it is going to take that long because they cook it fresh and  they do not use heat lamps.  I worked in restaurants, heat lamps have nothing to do with timing neither does cooking it fresh.  that part was unacceptable.  the music was way too loud.  basically you have to commit to three hours for this place while the music blares.
  
2nd.  but for two items, the food was good.  Banana pancakes, eggs, potato were tasty.  the sausage was below average.  The bacon was horrible and that was even after we told them how we liked it.  three attempts of failure.  no way that was freshly cooked.  Oh, and the ice tea was bad.

price was reasonable given Vegas these days. 

so late night, if no one around, and you can sit immediately and they immediately bring your food, then go for it.  other than that, it is your risk...."
5445,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Farm to table. And then another table. And another. So much food. 

Went in a group of 7 out-of-towners. Despite the pleadings of one of our members that sharing might be a good idea, we each ordered individual dishes. We should have listened...

The sage fried chicken and waffles was the most popular dish at the table. 3 of us ordered it, myself included,  and everyone got a taste. The chicken was nicely fried, with perfectly crisp skin. I could have stood for it to be a little moister but that's nitpicking. You get two good size white meat pieces to go with your 4 bacon-Belgium waffles. Yes, the bacon is baked INTO the waffles. Brilliant.

I got to taste one of their giant flapjacks, as well (Snickers flavored). Fluffy and flavorful. That's the way to do it.

The server and other waitstaff helping out was very friendly and handled our large group well, including a late drink order change.

Drinks, yes, we had some, a variety of mimosas, a strawberry margarita, a BLT bloody mary. I wasn't overly impressed with my mimosa (I went with a lemonade one) but I ended up switching with someone who had a pineapple mimosa and we were both happier. The BLT bloody mary literally comes with a mini BLT. You just have to put it together yourself.

And all of that food was NOT terribly expensive. This is a great value on the strip. You easily get at least two, if not 3, meals out of each dish, and, with reasonable prices to begin with, that means more money in your pocket to chase straights or split your eights."
5446,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Chicken. And. Waffles. That's all you need to know and all you need to get!! Make sure you share it with someone because it is huge. Think gourmet, fancy, over the top chicken and waffles. It comes with 4 huge waffles with bacon pressed right into it topped with 2 large pieces of moist, tender fried chicken with a knife through the center holding it all together. The whole dish is garnished with sage, fried green onions, cherry tomatoes and a side of their maple syrup! It's hands down the best fried chicken you will ever eat and will ever need.

I saw other tables with dishes and everything is GINORMOUS so please do your waistline and wallet a favor and SHARE or be prepared to bring a lot of food home."
5447,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The Food is Good to Very good, depends on what you like and what you order. REALLY LARGE PORTIONS ! If A GOOD STAFF IS ASSEMBLED with good customer service skills,  it's Great, usually The service is hit or miss. When the service is off and slow, they rectify things with a free dessert or drink. When the service is good, they are really on top of things to make it a great dining experience and Fun time. Tried many items, we've been going for years. Liked everything. Sage chicken, lemon chicken, Love The Stuffed hamburger, The chicken pot pie is HUGH, usually take left overs home & eat for 2 Days. Sometimes it's very busy, sometimes Not, sometimes dirty. No consistency with service or cleanliness, they leave dirty plates on empty tables much too long sometimes and the floor most times dirty with napkins, utensils and food, disgusting. So I can only wonder,  WHAT THE KITCHEN LOOKS LIKE !  It's deterred us from going back regularly, Now much longer intervals between visits, much less frequency in dining at Hash House, it's too Bad, we use to go a lot, especially for Special occasions, Not Any Longer ! They Need to Clean up the juggling act, And balance the Cleanliness & consistency with much higher standards and PRIDE !!!"
5448,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Went for b-fast.  Waited to be seated which we expected.  However, from the time we sat down until the food came was an hour.  Waiter apologized for the long wait.  

I ordered the corned beef and eggs; it was cold and the taste was off. Waiter came by after my wife was almost done with her food.  When he saw I had not eaten my food he asked if it was alright.  I said ""no"" and said it was cold and had a peculiar taste.  Waiter apologized and brought me the bill. 

$14 for an large plate of food that went to the garbage."
5449,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Okay the portions are big and the good news stops there.  The plates are large and filled to capacity but the food lacks flavor.  Tried 2 plates; the cheese burger and the eggs with biscuits and gravy.  Not worth the calories or the price.  Go to In N Out for a burger or get a graveyard special biscuits and gravy at 1 of the casinos.
The service was okay."
5450,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge portions of great food.  My favorite is the pork sandwich, though Jena is a fan of the pancakes the size of a large pizza."
5451,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Myself & a group of guests went late night on A Saturday, it was a 15 minute wait because of the number of people we brought along.

We were only shown 1 menu with out much variety, it was hard for me to decide but I ended up going with Blue Crab Cakes & Pasta Salad. I LOVEEEEEEEED it so much I just wish it was a bigger portion like everything else on the menu. 

My boyfriend had the Snicker pancake. It wasn't what he expected, but he enjoyed it nonetheless.

I will be back to try more items"
5452,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Delicious food! Great portions of food.

Cons - Had to wait 40 minutes to sit and another 40 minutes for the food but it was worth it. 
We also had trouble finding the host stand with all the other people waiting."
5453,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Definitely a must have, you can't beat the portions and variety. Most amazing breakfast ever!"
5454,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Hash House A Go Go was one of the greatest experiences I've ever experience. I has Breakfast here with my boyfriend and my boyfriend had the original flapjack meal and I had the banana French toast with pecans. 
The waitress did tell us it is big portions and we saw our food we were shock of the size and portion of the meal. Everything looked so delicious and it was so tasty. 

I would say this place is really good, however it does get very busy so make sure you either have a reservation or go during a time that isn't busy because you will wait up to about an hour or two because it's a very popular restaurant lucky for us we only waited 5 minutes. 

When I'm in Vegas again, definitely going back to this place it was so delicious and the atmosphere of this place is great too."
5455,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Fantastic food. Great service. Amazing prices. Absolutely worth going to. The amount of food is insane, enough for you to really split. The homemade jam and house bread is to die for."
5456,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent mid-western food. The pancakes are massive. So is the wait to get seated. Recommend when hung over.
5457,Hash House A Go Go,1,The  customer service was good from our waiter but the food to was overrated I had the chicken and waffles to me it had no flavor it was just bland..just terrible..maybe the cook had a bad day or something..but hey it happens tho
5458,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went to the one on Sahara last year.  Food here is just as tasty & portions are just as huge.  

This time I got the fried chicken with eggs & bacon mashed potatoes.  Think chicken & waffles with mashed potatoes mixed in with bacon in lieu of the bacon stuffed waffle.  The chicken was just as moist, the potatoes were creamy and with the bacon strips and bacon pieces mixed in were heavenly.  I did not care for the biscuit though as it was too thick and dry.

Wait time was surprisingly not that long on a Thursday late morning.  Definitely come to Hash House with an appetite for a lot of good food."
5459,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Of course there's a line but who cares?! This place is the bomb! I ordered the tractor that comes with eggs & a biscuit & a brown sugar pancake. Holy moley, that thing was huge!! Best pancake hands down. I also ordered the kiwi watermelon tea...with the help of yelp reviewers. Thank you all!!"
5460,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had breakfast here Tuesday morning and had to wait like 5 minutes. I kept telling the friend I was with that the portions were huge, he didnt believe me. 

I ordered the biscuits and gravy. They were decent, not the best I had. I didnt like them on top of the mashed potatoes. The eggs were good. The boys I was with both lovvvvedd their food and almost ate all of it."
5461,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We enjoy the food but the employees all need an attitude adjustment.  You are in the customer service 
Field. No need to be rude. If you have your job then please quit so they can hire someone with a positive attitude.  So sad because we love the food but not worth putting up with the rude staff.   Give it a try hopefully your experience will be better than mine.  Everybody has a bad day I guess."
5462,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was well seasoned.  Our waiter was attentive and helped us order the most popular items on the menu.  He also was kind enough to tell us that one item can feed two or maybe three people.  He was right!  The portions are huge and so filling.  This is a comfort food heaven.  They have several types of delicious Bloody Mary's.  Definitely a Vegas must.
5463,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food was not good. It's all mushed together & you have to disassemble their ""presentation."" I wouldn't go back at all."
5464,Hash House A Go Go,4,Amazing flavors and huge proportions! They just need to work on staffing better. Waited for 30+ minutes when there was clearly several empty tables. Our waiter was super friendly and gave great service!
5465,Hash House A Go Go,4,One word- Awesome!!! The food was on point! The proportions...well let's just say that I 100% guarantee that you will not leave dissatisfied or hungry in any way. I felt like a glutton and loved it!! Merica!! Service was decent- not award winning but not bad. Overall I left this place as a happy camper in a food coma.
5466,Hash House A Go Go,5,Definately share a plate w someone else. Second visit... Chicken and waffles... Must get! Sooooo good!
5467,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great option for breakfast along the strip. Prices are very reasonable for what you get and service is fast and friendly. Got eggs which were cooked really well, bacon that was actually thicker cut and crispy and pancakes that are larger than the plate. Just as a side note for those not able to do stairs, there is a tiny elevator in an unassuming looking pillar that will take you up from the casino floor.  Had breakfast here 2 days in a row and was not disappointed!"
5468,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Haven't been here in years, I must say it has really gotten better.  I forgot how big the portions were, so beware.  If you are a light eater, share with someone.  I love to eat but we really had too much.  The service was great, we were quickly seated (which was because it's a weekday and there are only 2 of us), our waitress was prompt and very nice, and the food came out in less than 6 minutes.  Here is what we had:

Hot Chocolate:  had to put this in there because it was so big and beautiful and yummy! This one cup could serve 2 people too.  Served with real marshmallows, you can add whipped cream and they top it off with chocolate powder and  chocolate sauce

The famous Sage fried chicken and waffles: Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks - the chicken was nice and crispy on the outside, and juicy in the inside, the waffles don't have just a small amount of bacon, it is basically layered in the middle.  Super yum and could definitely feed 2 grown people or 3 children. 

Side of granola and fruit:  this is anything but a side.  It is basically a whole meal.  I had to take it home because it was so much.  The fruit was perfect, some sweet amd some tangy, came with milk and honey. 

We were brought to go boxes so fast like they were reading our minds.  I would definitely come back with my family and I suggest to you all too."
5469,Hash House A Go Go,4,No matter what time of day this place is always busy! Menu is very interesting and offers many selections. I ordered the corned beef hash and the presentation of the food was amazing. The food was good and service was excellent . It was fun to see what other people ordered as the presentations are great !
5470,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food was Amazing! Kids lived it,hubby like it and I'm very satisfied! Had the brown sugar pancake  Delish! Kids had chicken strips and mac and cheese, the portions are huge!!! Must come and check this place out!!! If in Vegas make it a priority! Will not fail you!"
5471,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Woo. Quite a wait. We got our ticket and walked around Caesar's Palace for awhile and came back and our table was ready. About an hour. 

We debated between the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and decided to go with the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.

I read some reviews that people said it was too heavy on the sauce, but with all the potatoes and biscuit, I think there was a need for more. 

I also think they should've poached the egg. A runny egg would've been better than the scrambled egg. 

Overall, it was very delicious. The chicken was crispy and tasty, the bacon was delicious, and the sauce was great. 

I will definitely return. I'll try the Chicken and Waffles next. :)"
5472,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good food!  Their mimosa was excellent.  Also, the B.L.T. bloody mary was pretty good!  toast could have used some work but other than that, i was a fan!  Had the veggie hash...great!  A little too much sun dried tomato for my taste BUT the potatoes were awesome!  We waiting approx 15 minutes so not too bad.  The waiter Richard was great!"
5473,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Very curious to try as we've seen this place in Man vs. Food (I'm a fan of the show). Their portion sizes are really huge! I was only disappointed with their shrimp appetizer, expected it to be plenty as I know their portions are enormous but got only 3 pieces in a huge plate."
5474,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went to Hash House on the recommendation of a friend and it didn't disappoint. 

The wait for four was about 30 minutes on a Mother's Day Sunday. But after getting and seeing the food others are eating, you start to salivate, anticipating what you're going to order.

Be afraid of the portions, because they are LARGE. You may notice that their plates are more like serving platters and their portions fill each plate (platter).

I had one of their scrambles and it was the smallest plate. Their BBBLT sandwich may contain a 1/2 lb. of bacon and the bread is at least 1-1/4"" thick! If you order the french toast, you'll get two large pieces of tasty delight and the fried chicken is very very moist but keeping the skin crunchy.

Prices range in the $15 - $20 range, but are large (LARGE) enough to share... unless you are the UNLV football team. 

We went to the location in the Imperial Palace. It was a great location and the wait wasn't too bad, but I hear the locations NOT on the strip are a bit less crowded."
5475,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is great! We came here on a Thursday morning around 11am and had a 15 min wait not too bad. Our server was great very friendly and offered good suggestions on what to order. I had the ham, cheddar, spinach scramble with mashed potatos and it was bomb! The biscuits were my favorite part sooooo fluffy. The only negative was waiting for the actual order it took a long time for breakfast about 30min. But they were pretty packed. We will be back again the next time we are back in Vegas."
5476,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A family style breakfast place. The food portion is huge but tasty. We tried 
1. house smoke salmon egg Benedict - amazing yummy!
2. waffle combo with eggs and sausage. Waffle is crispy. good!
3. pancake combo with hash. Pancake itself is really thick. 
Huge portion, good for a group people."
5477,Hash House A Go Go,3,This restaurant was highly recommended and the menu sounded delicious so we tried it. All the food served is massive and tastes good- definitely share plates. The restaurant itself is extremely loud and we were sitting next to a family whose mother had a few drinks and was obnoxiously loud and annoying. We were by the kitchen area where servers were going in and out and a manager was berating a server right behind me and I could hear the whole conversation. Not professional.
5478,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I am from San Diego and Hash House A Go Go is one of my favorite places to take people--the LINQ location did not disappoint!  The Sage Chicken Benedict may be one of my favorite dishes of all time, it is a must try. The red velvet pancake is good, but I highly recommend the blueberry or brown sugar banana pancakes instead. We also loved the banana french toast.  The HH Bloody Mary is AMAZING! Make it a double ;)"
5479,Hash House A Go Go,5,Huge portions. Nice staff. Surprisingly priced reasonably for the massive amount of food you get!
5480,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Well worth the 45+ minute wait (and the 30 minutes of trying to find the entrance to the IP... and navigating through the casino to find the restaurant).  Well, well worth it.  

The chicken fried benedict was quite simply the most perfect breakfast imaginable.  My boyfriend, from the South, even said the fried chicken was better than his - HUGE compliment from the most particular eater I have encountered.

Our table of four ordered the chicken fried benedict, French toast, chorizo scramble, Truck Driver breakfast with a vanilla waffle, and a Snickers pancake on the side.  The only complaint was about the vanilla waffle - my sister-in-law was not a fan, but since I did not try it, I am still going with 5 Stars. :)

I am quite the large eater, as is my 6'5"" 300lb brother, and there was food enough for at least three more when we left.  This is definitely going to be a must-stop every time we are in Vegas.  My diet and exercise plan is glad there are not any locations in Phoenix. :)"
5481,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It was edible, but not very good. 

I feel like when a restaurant has been featured on shows like Man v. Food and in the New York Times there is a failure to innovate or keep standards anymore and this restaurant plays in to that hypothesis. 

I was with ten people and nearly all of us had the sage fried chicken and waffles and none of us enjoyed it. The best it can be described as is ""okay"". The chicken was an airline cut which I was impressed about, but the flavors fell flat. A dry breast with a soggy soft waffle. The waffles had bacon in them but it was one long strip, and the chicken needed salt 

I wouldn't go back - it wasn't worth the price or the hype."
5482,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The staff here was great; part of our party was running late but they worked with us to maintain our reservation.  The wait staff was very friendly as well.  That said the food was rather bland.  They bring a lot of it, but it is quite average.

Certainly not a place to avoid, but it shouldn't be high up on one's list."
5483,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ok, this place is WORTH the wait.

If you aren't ready to wait to get in and wait for your food then move along elsewhere...otherwise bring your appetite and your patience because you will enjoy it.

Our server Travis was great...he gave us, and those around us a great description of the place and highlighted several items on the menu.  Since you're on vacation...go with something you really can't get a breakfast back home.
My sister ordered the original hash house farm benedict and I ordered the brown sugar banana flapjack that was almost like a bananas foster pancake.  It wasn't like a thick filling pancake - it was lighter and fluffy and just delicious!!! I had this with tangerine juice to drink.  This place is yummy and there are several locations so definitely go...try it!"
5484,Hash House A Go Go,1,Waited over 1 hr then sat for 30 more min just to return my food. Pancake had no flavor and they got my order wrong. At this point I wasnt hungry anymore and ate off my husband plates. His chicken and waffles had more skin/batter than the actual chicken. They dont have straws unless u buy an alcoholic drink. The apple juice isnt too good. Wont recommend or return
5485,Hash House A Go Go,4,"HUGE portions, I'm talking bigger than you've ever seen in your life. Helps offsets the price. The chicken pot pie looks like it was made in a ten gallon drum, and it costs $20. Could seriously feed your whole group alone. New drink (made with Huckleberry vodka) is DELICIOUS, but not enough of the vodka. Our server was very personable and friendly, but the service overall is lacking. No one was standing at the front to greet us, and we waited around for someone to notice we were there. They approach the front and ask ""Which group was here first?"", pointing at my group and another one who had used the other entrance. Hello, you shouldn't have to ask your customers who was there first if you just stood at the desk. And, they didn't bring my friend's iced coffee until we were almost done with our meal, but the delicious flavor made it worth the wait. All in all, would come here again, but not unless I had a HUGE appetite!"
5486,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went on a Saturday morning and even though it was packed we got seated pretty quickly. Our server was the best, very attentive and helpful in what to order. Hubby got the Andy's sage fried chicken, it was huge and so delicious, two people can definitely share it but my husband didn't want to lol so I got the house scramble with potatoes. I really liked this place."
5487,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I had the pork tenderloin Benedict. Not your typical Benedict.  I have to say, this  was the best thing I ate in Las Vegas all weekend. The sauce made me want to lick the plate! So crispy and delicious. I wished I wasn't so full so I could finish it! The service was excellent  here, and we beat the rush and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  Honestly  though, the pork tenderloin Benedict  was worth waiting an hour for!"
5488,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent service really creative and tasty foods. I took a large group to this meeting it was great!
5489,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is amazing. The food was great and the service was beyond great. Our waitress was Elisa (I hope I am saying her name right) but she was wonderful. She made great meal recommendations, kept our drinks coming and made us feel very welcomed. 

I love a place that not only has good food and great service. 

If Elisa's manager is reading this, SHE DID A GREAT JOB!"
5490,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Don't get the hype about this place, food isn't all that. Biscuit was the driest biscuit I've ever had! The waiter was super friendly and raved about the ""homemade biscuits"" but they are so dry! The mashed potatoes were good, sausage, potatoes and eggs were okay, nothing special.

Love the fact that they are open 24 hours! Not much else to say, comparable to a Denny's if you ask me."
5491,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Visiting Vegas for my birthday. Took a cab here because of all the awesome reviews. Waited an hour to eat and it was all WORTH IT. This place brought me back to life from a night of partying and celebrating. I'm a plain Jane so I got the plain buttermilk flapjack with eggs (scrambled with cheese) and potatoes and a side of bacon. My server Kai saw I was sitting alone and sat down at my table to take my order. Nice personal touch. She recommended some drinks for me and I opted for the Kiwi watermelon lemonade. She did advise is stir it a bit (altho it's soo pretty seeing the swirl of red yellow and green) to get the flavor a nice blend. Fresh watermelon in the drink, they give you a big straw to not disturb your drinking pleasure and boy was it delish. When my meal came out I now see why they only give u one flapjack. It's HUGE. It took up more than half of the plate and was so soft and buttery and yummy. They give u one cup of syrup and I barely used it the flapjack takes soo great. Eggs were divine, potatoes cooked awesome and bacon cooked to perfection. Many thanks for such great service and great food. I opted for the souvenir cup and my total was only $35. Not bad at all!! I know why it's recommended and when I return to vegas I'm coming back not only for the food but I hope to see Kai there as well. She's an awesome server!"
5492,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I ordered the Andy's safe fried chicken benedicts and it tastes great! Paired with their mash mellow  mocha makes it more yummy~ 
The service is terrific. Waiters are very friendly. Waiting time is about 20 mins but the waiting line moves fast. 
Very good place for breakfast/brunch if you are craving for comfort food."
5493,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is by far the best deal in Vegas. It is located on the strip amongst all the other place that are convenient to your hotel but you'd never know it based on the service, prices and quality. The servers are friendly, personable and informative. Our bartender/waiter gave tons of great suggestions for our trip.  The prices are the most reasonable in town and the portions are huge! The food is equally high quality. The eggs Benedict that I ordered for I think $13 kept me satisfied all day. The chicken and bacon stuffed waffles, $17-$18 I think, was enough for 2-3 people. And it was as good as it sounds.

If you're on a budget but still want to eat somewhere fun with ""Vegas flare"", this is the spot! Open 24/7 and centrally located on the strip."
5494,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place!  The wait staff is excellent.  Friendly and very attentive even though it gets crazy busy.  The portions are ridiculous and unlike other places that replace quantity for quality, this place has both.  With all the options available in Vegas, this has made my rotation is which is high praise for me.

The best value here is the kids menu...one kid's plate could probably feed like 3-4 kids easily"
5495,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food was ok, nothing special.  The restaurant smells like stale cigarette smoke, so if that's your kind of scene, enjoy!"
5496,Hash House A Go Go,5,Wow. This place is amazing. I don't like breakfast for various reasons. The main one being the options. When I travel I usually skip it and do an early lunch but I gave this a try because of the reviews and the time constraints we were under. Best eggs and breakfast potatoes I've had by far.The biscuit was also really good. Skip being robbed by a buffet and come here instead you'll love it. Please bring one of these to Atlanta!
5497,Hash House A Go Go,4,Awesome food. The servings are huge.  I had the cornbeef hash and it was so good. I highly recommend this spot.
5498,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Oh man, who would've thought this kick ass resto was in such a old school hotel?  After several trips over the years to Vegas, it was my first time stepping into the Imperial Palace and kinda glad I did.

Decided to have breakfast here on Saturday and arrived at around 12:30pm.  There were a ton of people ahead of us and the wait was like 30-minutes but we decided to stick it out.

We had enough time waiting that we looked through the menu and knew what to order.  The s/o was ordered the Chicken & Waffles and I had the Chorizo Hash.  Fast forward 10-15 minutes...They bring out the plates and God have mercy, the s/o's C&W was huge!  I would've helped eat it but it came with two, yup, two breasts and I don't like white meat.  The s/o liked it and said the chicken was flavorful.  My Chorizo Hash was terribly good and spicy.  It had tons of jalapenos on it which radiated it's spiciness.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly and delicious, geez, even my eggs were delicious!  I didn't care too much for the biscuit though, it was a little dry.

Our server, Marcelino I think his name was, he was super attentive and friendly.  He anticipated what we needed right when we're about to ask for it.  The entire staff was friendly and seemed to help each other out, even the manager refilled our drinks, way to go team!

HHAGG is definitely a must try when you're in Vegas!"
5499,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is always a fun place to eat!! We have been to a couple of locations, the one in Orlando and two now in Vegas!! It's great every time!!! Portions are huge and the staff does a great job getting food in and out!!! A Must Go!!"
5500,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Disclaimer: I live in Vegas, work at a nightclub & have 4 years of hospitality/bar experience. 

After a night of monitoring my friends drinking and babysitting I, regrettably, decided to bring him here. LUISA, our server, clearly doesn't have the fucking mental capacity to RECOGNIZE that intoxication has many MANY different forms (not just ""belligerent"") & decides to FUCK UP MY MORNING with her poor decision making. 

My friend, being a drunk piece of shit asks the server for TWO SHOTS of tequila. DESPITE HER WALKING UP TO MY FRIEND SLEEPING IN THE BOOTH and me telling her that he has had enough and to not serve him she chooses to disregard ALL OF THAT & serve him anyway. But instead of bringing him what he actually asked for she brought him a BIG FUCKING $17 DOUBLE. 

We don't finish, as we decided to get to-go boxes and leave. We get the check and I can't help but feel a type of way bcs he shouldn't have been served to begin with. It's not about the money (BECAUSE FOR HER TIP I LEFT THE PRICE OF THE SHOT) it's just principal. On top of that the manager comes out, tries to pull the ""well we can't refund bcs it's already poured"" LIKE COMPS/VOIDS don't fucking exist. I WILL GLADLY GIVE YOU A FUCKING MICROS TRAINING CLASS.  Just annoyed by the entire experience. Luisa wasn't annoying and I shouldn't be as upset as I am considering I still paid for the fucking shot but just the fact that nobody wanted to own the mistake was killing me. You tried it short black manager dude. You  tried  it"
5501,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First thing we noticed was that their portions are GIGANTIC!  

Located in the LINQ, it was our first choice after we arrived (around 10:30 pm or so).  The two of us ordered only one entree: Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  We couldn't finish it.

When we came, the waiter said there were no more honey buttered biscuits (although we did keep seeing other waiters bring them out) so he gave us plain biscuits w/ homemade strawberry jam.  We were able to get a honey buttered biscuit from some friends though, and they were goood!

Our Chicken and Waffles came and it was huge!  2 chicken breasts with 4 bacon waffles.  The chicken and waffles go great with the fried green onions on top.  The maple syrup served with the waffles also have a great flavor, better than usual maple syrup.

We wanted to give it another try the next morning, but turned back around as soon as we got up the escalator.  The lobby was PACKED in the morning for breakfast!  If you're hoping to avoid the wait, go during off-peak hours."
5502,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A must try in Vegas.  2 Locations- one on the strip, surprisingly in IMPERIAL PALACE (gives this hotel some flare), and the other location- a drive away.

Featured restaurant on man vs food.  Twisted comfort farm food.  Been here twice.  Ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  Massive show of massed potatoes, topped with biscuits, topped with eggs benedict, friend chicken, holladaise sauce.  The first 5 bites are sinful.  After that, you're just full.  Each plate is a serving for two.  Yes you can order it for yourself, but I prefer to share.  

Only downside, the last time I ate here the eggs benedict were not poached eggs, actually it was scrambled?! WTF?!  I didn't ask questions, was too busy devouring my meal.

Friends ordered fried chicken and waffles- waffles were infused with full sized strips of bacon.  Also a pancake plate- the size of a 15"" pizza.

Everytime I visit Vegas, I must go here!!"
5503,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow, server steve was outstanding. Gave us newbies the best advice.  Didnt want to waste time, so quickly asked, ""whats your favorite on the menu?"", and this dude knocked it outta the park. Worth a good tip indeed.  

Did the andy sage chicken thingy.  Jen had the chicken and waffles.  Frickin huge.  Solid service, great food, great tastes,....all as advertised.  Coffee was excellent, large OJ was large, water was cold and filled quickly. Food hot, delivered quickly, and man did it hit the spot. 

We beat the crowd and showed up ona Tuesday am at 1030.  Thought it was a good move, and it paid off.  Will visit again.  Valet parking at Rio the way to go.  Duke the valet, and you get solid directions."
5504,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great Bloody Mary.  Great food.  Huge portions. Service was pretty quick for how packed it was
5505,Hash House A Go Go,5,Came in for a quick bite to eat before heading home. Got a table without waiting to long. Our server(Alan) came right over and greeted us. He got us started with some bloody Mary's and gave us some suggestions which were excellent. I had the corned beef and my gf had the biscuits & gravy....Alan check on us making sure everything was just right. I'd recommend coming back especially with such great food but even better service!!!
5506,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I heard a lot of great things about this place but I just wasn't that impressed. The food is average. The portions are obscene! Definitely NOT the place to go if you're watching your figures, ladies! The wait for a table at brunch time is more than an hour! *gasps* It was not worth the wait. 3-stars because the service from our waiter was great! He was so accommodating and so patient with me while I asked a million-and-one questions. Minus 2 stars because the food is a bit bland."
5507,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If this review was based solely on food, I'd give it 5 stars. The Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles were delicious. The food was stacked pretty high and the portions are large. I had shared the dish with my boyfriend and we couldn't finish the whole thing. The chicken was juicy, yet crispy on the outside and complimented the waffles quite nicely. We also ordered the Hash House with fresh mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach. I think had we ordered any of the hash dishes with meat, it would've been game over.

So here's what made it a 3star place: the location and wait. You think Imperial Palace is confusing to begin with, but wait until you try looking for this place. It's located on the second floor deep inside the casino. Oh, but you can't access it from the casino second floor... it's in its own little vicinity. Quite strange. And the wait took a while, around 45 minutes just to get seated. The service was slow and, on top of that, they forgot to put in our order, so we had to wait even longer. Also our table was also being swarmed by fruit flies. Not sure why, but it made the experience annoying.

Would I ever go back? I think I'll try the other location down the strip."
5508,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great experience here with the food and service. Our group ordered the chicken and waffles and this pork dish. When they say the portions are huge it's an understatement. The food was tasty and the service was friendly. Really glad I was able to try it.
5509,Hash House A Go Go,4,"If you're craving for a late night breakfast, this is the place to go. Humongous portions, decent flavor and pretty plating makes this place a must go if you're in the area. We ordered the the chicken and Benedict and shared with 3 people and still couldn't finish the food.  It was the man vs food favorite."
5510,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came here on Sunday at 730am. Hands down, the best time to go. And also the best time to walk the strip. It's nice and peaceful and you avoid the swarms of tourists that are normally waking around when 1pm hits. 

Anyways, I digress. 

So Man v. Food came here and finished two plates which is quite a feat since each dish is about 1 foot tall and swimming in gravy. Okay maybe not really but their portions are HUGE. 

Bf had the very popular sage fried chicken dish. And I had the nappallee (?) hash. We only finished a third of our dishes. But it made for yummy leftovers. 

When we walked out at 830, the line had formed and the waiting area was packed. So... Come super early to avoid the line if you happen to be up that early in Vegas."
5511,Hash House A Go Go,5,Small hole in the wall spot I have to call it but literally everything I have ever had here I loved. From the chicken sandwich to there steaks. Go back every year.
5512,Hash House A Go Go,2,Only bc of the super dry burgers. Service is good. But the food is pretty low quality.
5513,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Really really really ridiculously delicious. I tried the fried chicken eggs benedict- it was UNREAL & so was the portion. The line sucks, and this restaurant is inside the Imperial Palace, but who cares- the grub is worth it. Stay away if your trying to eat healthy or watching your weight. I walked  out probably 5lbs heavier than when I walked in. This place totally lives up to the hype- got to try it next time your in Vegas."
5514,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Since my wife and I have stayed at the Plaza several times, we usually eat downstairs at the HH A Go Go.   The service is OK; the prices are reasonable and the servings are large.  The presentation is good.  The problem is that the ambiance and the quality of the food is only So-So instead of Go-Go.    For ambiance, I would not have all the metal wall covering as it seems so out of place at a diner.  For quality, I would try to offer food with more uniqueness that I would not find at other diners.  I think more of a fusion approach to cooking would entice me to eat at the HH A Go Go more often."
5515,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Located inside Imperial Palace on The Strip.  Came here with my 3 girlfriends while on a quick trip to Vegas.  We ended up splitting 2 dishes amongst the 4 of us because the portion size is huge!  

We ended up ordering Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks and the Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach Hash.  Both were excellent but I have to say the Fried Chicken and waffle dish was our absolute favorite.  First of all, the presentation is amazing.  It's something straight out of a Man v Food challenge.  2 large pieces of fried chicken stacked on top of 2 delicious bacon waffles.  The chicken has amazing flavor and makes a great pair with the sweet/salty taste of the waffles.  The hash came in a skillet that was literally the size of a frying pan and was extremely tasty with the combination of country potatoes and other fixins.

They also have some pretty yummy mimosas on the menu.  We didn't have a reservation and ended up waiting only about 15 minutes when we went around 11:30am on a Friday morning.  Would definitely recommend it to everyone and can't wait to get back there again!"
5516,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great breakfast/brunch place! Was so good we went twice while on vacation! 

My husband and I tried the following when we were there: 

Chicken and waffles 
Side salad 
Pumpkin pancake
Fried chicken Benedict 

Fried chicken Benedict was hands down my favorite! Loved the sauce that came with it and that it also had mashed potatoes! Would love to recreate this at home!"
5517,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Sorry to be the one who doesn't 4 star or 5 star this place -- heard many great things, and had recommendations to try this place out; unfortunately the food is ""OK"" nothing to rave about, or worth coming back to. 

Service is great, and the restaurant itself is uniquely designed. The tables have metal sheets as the table top, and I promise you if you put your hands on them, your hands end up smelling like metal (quite odd right?) i'm not sensitive to smell etc, but this was clear and bad when ""hungry"" :)

I ordered the tractor combo, and while the pancake is GIGANTIC, the thickness of the batter wasn't very appealing/tasty -- the ham was ok, and the eggs were ok, overall an OK meal."
5518,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I just couldn't get down with this place. I think it's hyped, but to be FAIR I didn't try the one in San Diego, and I've been to San Diego three times. However this one was just not good, the food was bland, oversized, and expensive. I get that it's supposed to be ""cool big portions"" but it's unnecessary and the presentation isn't even worth it, just looks like a whole bunch of overwhelming slop. I know that sounded harsh but I'm a straight shooter. You can do better than hash a go go, but it WAS open and we were just coming off a 10:30pm flight. *shrugs*"
5519,Hash House A Go Go,5,Do not go here for brunch if you're in a hurry cause it's usually an hour plus wait. Everyone is hankering for the BLT Bloody Mary that is a meal in itself I suppose. Or the chicken and waffles that comes in a portion so big it fed me and 2 friends (and we had left overs!) I am southern and this place offers a comforting taste of home. But mind you comfort food is code for fat food! I don't recommend if you're on a New Years resolution diet kick. I just didn't dig  the giant piece of sage they use to garnish their dishes-it overpowers the food and makes it smell and even taste like a Christmas tree. Ask for them to 86 the sage or take an allergy pill before you go!
5520,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Delicious but so filling. Seriously, I shared a plate with someone and we couldn't finish it. I suggest getting a few plates to share among multiple people."
5521,Hash House A Go Go,3,Food was really good and plentiful. I had the sundries tomato and goat cheese eggs and my wife had pancakes and bacon. Everything was tasty. The service wasn't good. The server didn't check on us for 20 minutes after the food came out so I couldn't get butter for my biscuit and my wife ordered a drink that never came. Our water never got refilled until the bill came. I think it was just a bad server as people around us got good service
5522,Hash House A Go Go,1,"At 10:30am on a Saturday, there was a 2.5 hour wait...we turned around and walked away. No place is worth that kind of wait."
5523,Hash House A Go Go,5,Delicious. Huge crowd waiting but only took 20 minutes. The bloody mary bar in the waiting area made the time fly. Very nice staff. Try anything that has the sage chicken.
5524,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We visited the Hash House and PJ helped us out! Great service! PJ, thanks for making our visit a great one! All your feedback was much appreciated! Salute bro!"
5525,Hash House A Go Go,4,Awesome gluttony!  If you like huge plates of perfectly prepared plates you could only imagine then this is your place.  I would strongly advise to share a plate however if you do then you miss out on sharing something and trying something else spectacular. Be prepared for long waits and over-eating but it's well worth it!
5526,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First place I wanted to go to for breakfast when arriving to Las Vegas was hash house a go go. This was my very first time at this place. I would say that this is one of my top favorite places! They serve big portions that could be enough for two ppl. Their food is delicious!! I love it even more because they give you a side of fruit which all breakfast Places should have. You gotta try it out for yourself, it's so worth it."
5527,Hash House A Go Go,4,"DEEEEEEEEEEEEElicious!! Ordered the BLT bloody mary. A little bit lost on how exactly to drink/eat it. 
Also ordered the BLT to eat. (BLT kick??) Very good to both.  Bread was really good. 

Ate off the man's plate too. He got scrambled eggs, which were overly cheesy so ask for less cheese if you don't like having equal parts egg to cheese. 
They have really good biscuits and home made jelly."
5528,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I ordered the man vs food Fried Chicken Benedict in LINQ's Hash House location in Las Vegas 06/29/17. It was a massive amount of food that tasted delicious, but I got an awful bout of abdominal cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache, all of which are symptoms of food poisoning. Hash House was the only thing I had eaten that day, so it seems likely that is where it originated. We dined around 11am and I started having cramping around 9pm that evening. I had loss of appetite and woke up at 4am burning up with fever. The whole next day was an awful experience.

Also, I get that they are very busy, but the service was a bit lacking and the server did not bring my credit card back with the receipt which had me traveling all the way back to my hotel in a taxi and having to come all the way back to pick it up. Management did not do anything for the inconvenience which I thought to be a little off-putting. All around, I would recommend you find another place. There are locations in Chicago which I have not had any issues with."
5529,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The service first of all was not good. We felt like we upset our server by sitting in her section. She was burdened by our presence and so we ordered and never saw her until she came back to give us the check. Someone else filled our drinks and a cook/prep cook brought our food out. 

The food was NOT worth it. I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was horrible! I don't think we will be returning to eat here ever again. What happened to getting good service in this town??"
5530,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The menu is good, everything looks delicious - the one thing you don't realize is the size of the food that is about to descend onto your table! The hamburgers we ordered were mammoth two 1/2 lbs. patties with cheese and goodness melted between the meat. The fries were delicious and if you can get a half a burger into you, you're a king. Leftovers are guaranteed and I have to agree with their slogan,""if you leave hungry it's your own fault"". 
Prices were more than reasonable for the Vegas Strip and service was great at two different locations. Great place to visit, just make sure you're ready to carry a doggy bag the rest of the night."
5531,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ate at Hash House a Go Go multiple times and every time we had a great experience, unfortunately something must have changed as we didn't get the same experience this time around. First, not sure why the restaurant was so empty which was very strange. Asked the waitress and was told the restaurant has been seeing less and less customers recently. We ordered our breakfast and a few things stood out very quickly.  First, the coffee tasted as if the pot was sitting for a while.  Very strong taste. The food was okay but nothing like we experienced before.  One consistent piece was their portion size. You do get a lot of food."
5532,Hash House A Go Go,4,Thus places is inside the Linq Casino up the escalator so was a but challenging to find if you're not staying here. It's a good place my son enjoyed the fried chicken and waffles and I enjoyed the scramble and they were pretty darn good a lot of food for the money so if you're not super hungry you can probably split a portion.
5533,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Ordered steak n eggs, seeing the black angus cow I thought it would have been good. Unfortunately it was to chewy n greasy. Service is ok, but kinda slow. The biggest issue I had was the location. Kinda dark, no windows or good lighting and there's strong muggy/rosemary scent in the air."
5534,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG! I finally understand the definition of a foodgasm. I had been here before for breakfast but this time came for dinner, because we had a restaurant.com certificate that was good for dinner only. That was a lucky break, because dinner was fabulous!

My partner and I ordered the all blue crabcakes and the chicken and waffles. The crabcakes were huge and crammed full of real crabmeat. It was very rich but oh so good. A couple sauces on the side, one sweet and one with a little bit of spice were perfect compliments. And the side of potatoes were made of white potatoes and butternut squash. Yummy!

Save room for the chicken and waffles. This was the first time that I had ever tried this dish anywhere and as the waiter said, the bar has been set REALLY high now. The chicken was super crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. Great herbs and spices in the batter, perfectly complemented the chicken. The waffles were delicious and they had huge strips of bacon inside. We're not talking little bits o' bacon, we're talking huge, full-on strips o' bacon!

Beware! The portions are huge. We had enough to stuff ourselves at the table and to have two more meals. Luckily we're staying in a condo with a kitchenette. Definitely worth going here for any meal at any time of day. And check out restaurant.com for a really great coupon deal!"
5535,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Good food, good service, but please, don't have those little placards on the tables showing Happy Hour appetizers and drinks, only to be told you need to sit at the small bar to get them. We spoke to the manager Damien, showing him, that no where on the placard does it state ""Bar Only"" he was unmoved, even though we were only ten foot away from the Bar. We were there with out of state friends so the bar would not be ticket, Damien, the manager could use a course or two on customer relations, and lost revenue."
5536,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Sat down to get an early breakfast, despite craving the local store on Sahara and was greeted with awesomeness at the get-go! The bartender was sweet as pie! Even put in my full menu breakfast order before it was available! This local guy will be back to the strip! So thankful for the thoughtful service that is often neglected in the tourist corridor!"
5537,Hash House A Go Go,5,The best breakfast you will ever have!!! I have been to the San Diego location also and they are both very consistent! I highly recommend the Andy's fried chicken Benedict. I get it every time and am never let down. I would love to try other things on the menu as everything looks amazing but i just cant imagine anything tasting better. Always excellent and friendly service too! When you are in vegas this is a must try!!
5538,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I think our server gets annoying drunk people all the time so he doesn't provide great service or customer service... but my fiancÃ© and I were sober.  You'd think I'd be incredibly annoyed, but it was actually hilarious.  In fact, I tipped him more because it was so funny. Plus, I'd be jaded, too, if I had to serve drunk annoying people.  Service aside, the presentation was incredible.  The portions were huge and the fried chicken was delicious. We got the fried chicken Benedict and chicken and waffles. We left with almost our entire meals to go because the portions are huge. My fiancÃ© was down on this place but left a believer!"
5539,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Good food! I really enjoyed the country fries steak  HUGE PORTIONS! Takes about 3 people to eat one plate XD food was amazing, service was great! Water was a bit chlorinated but thats fine. Great experience, I would definetly recommend this place!"
5540,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent place for breakfast. The pancakes r enormous! I had the biscuits & gravy. Delicious.
5541,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Food is wonderfully presented and portions are huge but that's where the positives end.

Everything on the menu is so dense, heavy, greasy and BLAND that I don't understand why people rave so much. I haven't visited the Sahara location, but I can't see how it can be all that different.

My ""Crispy Hammered Pork Sandwich"" consisted of a giant slab of pork that's overwhelmed by oily breadcrumbs until you can't taste the meat.  Fries were overcooked to the point that oil had permeated each and every fry right to the core.

I walked out feeling vaguely nauseous and unwell. When we arrived home both my wife and I threw our to go boxes straight in the trash."
5542,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Guess the food is better when you eat in?

Stayed at the Rio with my family and my dog so someone had to stay behind with the pup while everyone else procured breakfast. This seems to be the only real breakfast place in the hotel/casino so options were pretty limited.... kind of like the menu.

 If you want fried chicken, bacon waffles, bloody Marys garnished with a deconstructed sandwich, etc, then 4  stars are probably well deserved.

My parents ordered the basic breakfast (one with scrambled eggs the other with over easy, both with sausages) and I ordered the sun dried tomato, goat cheese, & basil scramble with an extra side of chicken sausage.

In all honesty, I was starving so didn't realize a the stuff I missed until we got our to go order to the room.  First of all, all our orders were supposed to come with biscuits and fruit and we received a total of 1 biscuit and no fruit.  Second of all, I didn't even mind that there weren't enough biscuits because the giant hockey puck they tried to pass off as a biscuit was a dense mass that tasted like it was made yesterday.

We all chose fried potatoes which looked sad and possibly prepared at the same time the biscuit was made.  I didn't eat mine but my dog seemed to like it.

Also I'm pretty sure (receipt confirmed it) that my chicken sausage (which they do admit is in a pork casing) was actually pork sausage and was a little over seasoned for my tastes.

Lastly, the eggs. Had such high hopes for these. The scrambled eggs were either not seasoned and or not eggs? They were dense and oddly textured saved only a little by the sundried tomatoes, scant amount of fresh basil, and few crumbles of goat cheese.  Full disclosure, my dog wouldn't eat the eggs unless it had been touching sausage or had some cheese attached. 
Overall our breakfast was disappointing. Other than the forgotten items though the service was fantastic (hence the 2 stars rather than 1). All the staff members were so friendly and nice! The place was well decorated and very clean.

If they can get the kitchen sorted out I may consider eating here again but this place is definitely out of rotation on any future Vegas trips - even if we stay at the Rio again."
5543,Hash House A Go Go,4,The restaurant is hidden inside The Quad. The food is awesome. There is more than enough food to share on one entree. The portions are generous but the food will stop a heart. A must try if you in Vegas. Cheap food and it will get you full.
5544,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Felt like an ice box in the restaurant! The a/c is my main complaint! 
As I walked in, I understood that this was going to be dreadful. 

I had my boyfriend sit next to me and hold me to keep me warm. The food didn't take long, and it wasn't crowded with people so that is a positive. The server was good and always was around to help. 

The food was pricey, and it wasn't bad but wasn't good. Some parts of the meal were good but some I skipped."
5545,Hash House A Go Go,5,Talk about good portions for a great price. The flavor was amazing and the waitress was great as well. The wait was long but well worth it. Had the fried chicken with maple syrup and it was great. Highly recommend this place.
5546,Hash House A Go Go,4,"One thing I truly love is a spectacle. Doesn't matter of what, just as long as it provides me with some visual entertainment. With food, I love seeing the large and outlandish, quality is secondary and not expected but is always welcome. During my Vegas research, Hash House seemed the perfect spot for just that.

Organizing a party of 10 for breakfast in Vegas can be quite challenge, but luckily, everyone was late at about the same time. We actually didn't even have to wait that long for a table once our entire party was there. Once seated, the drink menu led me to my first show; a BLT Bloody Mary;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=_-fQlooq5QREsociXJU7Yw

Crisp toast, bacon, lettuce, and a tomato wedge all garnished this liquid meal. My first instinct was to smash all the solids into a pulp and mix them into my drink so I could suck down the slurry through the oversized straw. Luckily reason found me and I simply made a mini sandwich to munch on while sipping the well-made drink. 

I pondered ordering the famed tower of chicken and waffles, but I had a hankering for gravy that only gravy could satisfy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy at the recommendation of our server, based on my request of something large covered in gravy. After an expectedly long wait, our food began to pile in. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=bPvsgg04sxgX91PJmswpQQ

The biscuits were surprisingly light and fluffy and the gravy had about a pound of diced sausages in it. It was definitely something that would stick to your ribs. 

I also tried a bite of the ""stuffed"" burger and was very let down. We were expecting the ingredients to be cooked in the meat, not just placed between two over-cooked patties. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=xjtwgwuEKBkjvO0-k80eKw

Overall though it was a fun meal with food better than I expected. Service was attentive to our huge party and I think everyone had a good time. I'd go back."
5547,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I fail to see what all the hype is about this place.  Decent food, yes.  The hostess hands out flashers/beepers for people waiting to be seated, but then proceeds to screech, yell, and caterwaul at the top of her lungs when you're turn comes to be seated.  Very annoying.  The service sucked.  My coffee cup sat empty on the table most of the meal.  The waiter gave attitude when we had the audacity to ask him to split up the check so each of us could pay for what we actually ordered and ate.  This really ticked him off, and he made it clear.  Much better places to eat in Vegas where they appreciate your business."
5548,Hash House A Go Go,4,Loved it. Best place I went to in Vegas. Staff were so friendly and super relaxed. Bloody Mary with jalapeÃ±o stuffed olives wins every time. We went 3 times in 6 days. Can you say obsessed? Man vs food challenge was delicious. It's a Benedict but by the looks of it you have to dig for the eggs. The sauce is out of this world. One day I had the salmon scramble and it was awesome. Every thing we ordered was massive and could have been a man vs food challenge. I learned there's a hash house close to us in CT which means we are headed there ASAP. Yes you have to wait but it's so unbelievably worth it.
5549,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was goooood.  very gooood.  We had the chicken pot pie and a salmon scramble plate.  Both were really really good and were in large serving sizes.  Service was a little quirky and the carpet could of used a steam clean, to help the place seem a little cleaner.  But totally great place to eat."
5550,Hash House A Go Go,5,"It's been two hours and I am still feeling it. The quality and large portion blew me away. I could not finish my food. I really wanted too. The dish was amazing. I see why everyone talks about this breakfast spot. I will go again and again and one more time after that. 

Waitress was on point. Very energetic and kind. 

Go experience the greatness"
5551,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Huge portions! Huge...all the entrees are big enough to share. The cornmeal dusted shrimp was a great appetizer, even though an appetizer is definitely not needed considering the entree portions. Did I mention the portion sizes were huge? We had great service along with our gigantic food portions."
5552,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food was good. Portions are huge. Wish we had one in The Bay Area.
5553,Hash House A Go Go,1,"MY first time here heard a lot about it and wanted to try it out. Took my cousin here while he was out here from Houston (first Vegas trip for him) thought I was doing something. It took foreverrrrr for someone to come take our order, the menu doesn't have a huge selection which is too bad considering it's a chicken place. It took no less than 40 minutes for that damn chicken to come out you would have thought they had to pluck cluck duck and cut up the thing in the back! (I ordered their popular meal which clearly I didn't enjoy much if I forgot the name and my cousin ordered chicken strips) I'm really big on chicken and I have yet to meet someone who fries chicken like my mother, but this chicken tasted like air ! And I asked for ranch (eat ranch on everything) the lady brought it out but didn't mention that for that spit of a ranch would cost me $3 I could have brought a bottle in my bag (but ok whatevz).. The pole that broke the strippers toe was how I observed THREE staff members placing their bare hands on an order which sat out next to us at the bar AND one of them took a stick of lettuce off the sandwhich and placed it in another customers Bloody Mary! By then I was just more done than a steak and knew I would never come back. I guess they don't believe in gloves or sanitation for that manner. Everyone seemed to just be there waiting to clock out no smiles or anything. The only thing that was alright was the fact that it was happy hour so I only paid $3 for those two sour tasting drinks. Needless to say you got where I am going with this and goodnight !!! (MY cousin also hated his meal).. so yea there's that !!"
5554,Hash House A Go Go,3,"We came here recommended by just about everyone! We were worried about crowds but were surprised that there was no wait and were seated quickly.  Our server was pleasant and made great efforts in giving us his recommendations and telling us about hash house, we decided on the candied bacon, meatloaf, and burger...all great portions, and worth the price.  Tastes were unique and delicious, we really had no complaints but were shocked at how HUGE the portions were.  We could not finish any of it and didn't even take left overs because it was so much.  Only reason we did not give more stars was that after our server was done serving our food, he never came back and never refilled our drinks.  Nowhere to be found and finally showed up to give us our check.  Aside from that it was worth it, yummy and a unique try!"
5555,Hash House A Go Go,4,Portions are ridiculously big. Food is pretty good. Service was fast considering how many people were there. Great for sports games.
5556,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great food and service!! The breakfast options are great and portions were perfect. This is a must see place when your in Vegas!
5557,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The service was awesome and the food was amazing!! We had the banana brown sugar flapjacks, chicken and waffles, and another chicken dish that was recommended by the waiter. Everything was great! The portions are huge as well! We ordered three dishes amongst 5 people and left fuller than ever!"
5558,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I ate here twice.   The bacon waffles and BLT Bloody Mary were delicious.   I sat at the bar, got great service and I will return."
5559,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is always on my list whenever I visit Vegas. The most amazing chicken and waffles ever. The portions are huge and very tasty. Each item can serve two if you're not a big portion eater.

It was very busy with a 45 minute wait. The staff made sure to ask that I wait in their lobby as once the names are called the table can't be held for very long. They use  a very loud microphone to call the waiting customers so I feel they do their due diligence in attending to the busy line of customers.  My name was called within 20 minutes and I had a great experience once again."
5560,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome food. Huge portions. We had a great time. Pj was our server and had great recommendations. He was funny, and helpful. Too bad he was a dodgers fan! Haha we will be back !"
5561,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I'm not sure what the hype is about. Ok, the food value is great for Las Vegas standards but is it worth waiting over an hour in line and then waiting another hour to finally get your food? I would say for the price the chicken hash is stellar but the chicken and waffles falls flat. Fried chicken is very dry and the seasoning is subpar especially for being acclaimed. The bacon waffles are interesting but i would say that aside from the fact that targeted is bacon sandwiches in the waffle...both along are about the level of a Denny's or Waffle House. The chicken hash was moist and overall good seasoning and side mix. It is actually enough for two people and a suggested dish from me! 

Bottom line...some dishes are good some subpar but the long lines and slow service did not rank very high in my book for overall value. Too much wasted time, on to the next restaurant"
5562,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I didnt actually eat at this place, but the food looked great and it's in a prime location. The biggest if not only problem is there's to many options and it's hard to prioritize this place amongst the rest I'm giving it 4 stars because although it seems great I had not reason to choose hash hash go over its competiton"
5563,Hash House A Go Go,2,Warm spinach salad was good since I requested the dressing on the side. The dressing was terrible. Bloody Mary was fantastic! My partner had tenderloin...and it was so overcooked that it could not be eaten. Overall there are better places to eat for the money.
5564,Hash House A Go Go,4,"$63 + tip for brunch (2 cold/draft coffee, 2juice, 2 entrees). 

It was A LOT of food. Do yourself a favor - split a dish with someone. Andy's sage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower was ok. Andy's sage friend chicken Benedict was pretty good. The chicken was juicy. The chipotle sauce was good! 

It took forever (no - but really 20 minutes) to get our drink order and our food order can late because someone supposedly dropped our first one in the kitchen so it had to be remade. Our waiter was very personable. 

It was LOUD in there - there were some people really having a blast at their tables - so it was cool.  The ambience was pretty neat."
5565,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I so want to give this place 4 stars, but I can't.  Can I knock a star off if the portions are too big?  Sure I can!  If I can knock a star off for small portions, you can surely do the same for enormous size platters!

That's where Hash house goes array.  I don't even want to know how much food goes to waste here.  If you do pay a visit, do yourself and mother earth a favor and split a dish.

The food itself was very good.  I enjoyed my chicken and waffles and really liked the presentation."
5566,Hash House A Go Go,2,"The music was playing way too loud...to the point where I can barely hear the conversations within my own party. I mean, it was New Year's day and all, but I would have rather dined in a quieter setting. 

This was my second time eating at Hash House, previously at the San Diego location. And I must say, I like the SD location better. 

The portion for everyone else's order was large enough to feed a small town, expect mine. I ordered the turkey scramble to share and was quite disappointed. The potato to scramble ratio was 3:1, where the potato was definitely considered the main item and the scramble was the 'side'. Even though the entrÃ©e was just enough food for two people to share without feeling stuffed, I felt cheated.  If I had known they skimp on the scramble I would have opted for something else to get my money's worth.  Others were complaining about the bacon waffle that it was like brick and only picked at the bacon. 

Would I return to Hash House?...yes, but most likely another location."
5567,Hash House A Go Go,3,I was extremely underwhelmed by the food.  Basic American food and bad service.  Worst culinary experience in Vegas.
5568,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is amazing with the pricing(compare to other Vegas restaurants) and the portion! Great for everyone but especially those who lost a lot of money in the casino and does not want MacDonald or White Castle as their meal. This is also good for people who wants to eat a lot and those who are really drunk (good food to have in the stomach for those nights)

My wife and I saw the reviews on yelp and everyone says that one plate can feed 2 people!!! They are correct!!! As the waiters are bringing out food for other patrons in the restaurant.. all of them were enormous. My wife and I would just laugh at the peoples reaction who ordered one entree for each person. 

My wife and I ordered the popular Sage Fried Chicken Breast ($19.99?) and the All Blue Crab Cake Pasta & Salad (10.99?)  for DINNER. Both were very delicious! See the picture of food.. (The Sage Fried Chicken Breast meal is taller than the 24 oz cup of water)!! The Sage Fried Chicken comes with 2 large chicken breasts and 4 pieces of bacon fused waffles. As a tip, you can ask for extra syrup as the one tiny cup did not fulfill our needs. We had a tough time chowing it all down, but we did it. 

I would come back here again next time visiting Vegas if I want to stuff myself up."
5569,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow, they are serious about their breakfast here. Holy moly they serve them big and delicious. Got the sage fried chicken with waffles and it will forever haunt my foodie dreams. Soo good."
5570,Hash House A Go Go,4,"So it seems that people are totally split on HHAGG at IP.  They either had a horrible experience with bad service and/or bland food or they had a great experience.  I'm happy to say that ours was the latter.

We got there about 7 AM, the place was almost deserted and we were seated immediately.  Just after we were seated the server came over, took our order for coffee, water and a large (fresh & tasty) tangerine juice.  

When she returned several minutes later with our bevs, she asked if we still needed time to decide, which we did. When she came back we still didn't know what we wanted so she gave us a few suggestions and told us her favs as well.  

We like servers who tell you THEIR favs, not just what ""other"" people like or a list of just about everything on the menu.  

After several suggestions she sold us on the Sage Chicken Benedict and a side of fruit.  

For those of you who had bland food at HHAGG, I'm so sorry! =(  Ours was anything but.  

From the bottom up here's how the Benedict went:
Biscuits: Soft, warm and fluffy
Mashed potatoes: half hash brown, half mashed, griddled with a nice browned crispiness
Eggs: not over done, not underdone, just right
Smoked bacon: everything bacon should be; salty, thick and smoky 
Spinach and tomato: A good offset to the heaviness of the dish 
sage fried chicken: holy yummers!!!  Ours wasn't bland at all; it was sage-y & succulent 
Griddled cheese: a crisp & tangy blanket of heaven
Chipotle cream benedict sauce: the perfect rich and zesty topping to a decadent breakfast

Oh and the fruit...it was called a small side but it had 2 thick slices of cantaloupe, 4 thick wedges of pineapple, 4 -6 strawberries, several orange slices.  It was ripe and tasty, no sub-par ""garnish-grade"" fruit here; and just $3.95"
5571,Hash House A Go Go,5,Ok seriously...the Bacon/Mashed potatoe burger makes my mouth water everytime I think of it.  The staff cracks me up too. The Imperial Palace needed a restaurant like this!
5572,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed the food and service at Hash House A Go Go at the LINQ. PJ, our server, was efficient and polite. He gave us tips to navigate their incredible menu and safety tips as guests in this city. If you go to Hah House A Go Go at the LINQ, ask to sit in PJ's section!"
5573,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We were told about the huge portions so we shared a cooked breakfast and pancakes - fantastic food. Service was exceptional, really friendly helpful staff. Endless tasty coffee and the hot chocolate my daughter had with marshmallows was really yummy (and a meal in its self!)."
5574,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So it's, I don't know, 1am, on a Tuesday morning in Vegas, and I'm starving. I have this terrible habit of waiting until the very last minute to eat anything and therefore, I get insanely grumpy as my stomach starts to growl and hurt and all I want to do is eat something. Only problem is, even though it's Vegas and the place never really shuts down, it's still hard to find something to nosh on that doesn't cost an exorbitant amount of cash, or is even really open (and no, I will not eat Denny's way up by the Rivera- It's gross and the walk is ridiculous).

""Ever heard of Hash House A Go Go?"" my buddy asks me as we stand by the Bellagio fountains, sweating in the humid air, my temper already on a very short fuse cuz I'm sure not even orphans in war torn Africa are as hungry as I am at that moment in time.

""Nope,"" I reply. ""But as long as it isn't pizza or somewhere far, I'll give it a shot.""

We cross over to the Quad (which is actually pretty nice now that it's been remodeled and doesn't reek of pure tackiness) and, there at the top of the escalators, we walk into the place. Yes, I said ""walk-in"", as in we didn't have to wait in these really long lines everyone is complaining about on here. Maybe it's because it was mid-week and early in the morning, I have no idea, but those long wait times were non-existent.

Like others, I don't really get the whole ambiance of the place. Is it industrial? Is it retro? Is it some weird steam-punk amalgamation? Whatever it is, it doesn't really work. The various pictures on the wall (I seem to remember cowboys and burgers- but then again, I think I was a little drunk), just don't seem to mesh with the metal and the gray paint. But whatever, I was there to eat, not be an interior critic.

How long do you think for us to be seen by our waitress? 30 minutes? 40? Neither of those. Honestly, I would wager it was all of about 5 minutes or so before our waitress was at our table, asking for our orders. Hell, we had barely even begun to look at the menu. In fact, I was a little to preoccupied with the waitress herself, who was looking really good with her tattoos and nice smile. Her helpfulness was also pretty alluring.

Now, speaking of the menu, which is really what this whole thing is about isn't it? It's not especially big, by which I mean there wasn't a huge selection to chose from. The place brands itself as a breakfast joint, and they have a decent amount of offerings in that department, but I was more interested in something a little more traditional. I picked the burger and only after I made that decision did I realize it had mashed potatoes on it. Mashed potatoes? On a burger? What the hell? Well, I was in Vegas and it was late, and I was hungry, and I had to live a little, so I went with it. Plus, the waitress (who's name I can't remember, although I wanna say it was Gia, or something like that) had been so nice and I didn't want to make her hate me. My buddy, also drunk and clearly feeling the effects of drunk hunger, ordered the chicken and waffles on the suggestion of our server. She said it was good and what most people ordered. She also said the portions were huge.

When she said huge, she meant it. My burger came and I swear to God the thing stood like 8 inches tall. So much meat and toppings crammed in it. Yes, those mashed potatoes took up some of that space and I debated scratching them off with a knife, but they must have put those potatoes in there for a reason, right? I went ahead and just dove right in, tastes be damned. I can say that whoever made the decision to put those fluffy, white, mashed roots on a hunk of beef is a culinary genius and deserves an award. Simply put, my burger was delicious. I couldn't even finish all of it in one sitting, however I was able to take it back to the hotel and eat the rest of it for lunch the next day. It was almost like a whole new meal. As far as the chicken and waffles went, those too, should win some type of prize. They came pilled up on a plate in some kind of pyramid like stack, ready for consumption.  Oh, and those waffles had bacon in them. Yes, tasty, salty, crunchy, glorious bacon, mixed into the batter! 

Would I recommend this place? Yes!
Would I return? That would be a resounding Hell Yes!"
5575,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Does it live up to the hype?

Hash House A Go Go ( probably the only reason you would go inside Imperial Palace) in a certain way does live up to the hype.

Expect a hour wait when you get there. The portions are HUGE, and even though it is pricey, you would pay the same amount for a buffet, for roughly the same amount of food that an average person could eat.

Biggest Recommendation for First timers:
Get: the ANDY'S Sage Fried Chicken ( This is Benedict with the light orange sauce on top of it)...there are so many flavors thrown, the sweet of the biscuits, to the salty of the friend chicken and bacon, to the savory of the sauce on top, with the cheese and tomatoes make for a great meal.

Do Not Get: regular Sage Fried Chicken (Waffles on  top of fried chicken)...yes it might taste god, but this was somewhat of a let down...This to me was too regular.

Hash House a Go Go is twisted farm food. It is great comfort food, but be reasonable with your expectations. I certainly was!"
5576,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My group at here for brunch for the first time and everything was amazing.  We ordered chicken and waffles, chicken pot pie, and corned beef hash.  All portions were large enough to share.  The chicken pot pie was to die for!"
5577,Hash House A Go Go,5,Had an Excellent experience in Vegas. My Birthday Breakfast with my Best Friend. Bit of a wait but well worth it.
5578,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wish i had a stomach that could devour all this deliciousness! Visited Vegas with some friends..waited for 1hr and 30 mins but definitely worth the wait! Our table ordered the bloody mary blt..Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit...Sage Fried Chicken & WafflesTwo sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks...waffles...brown sugar banana pancake..portions are huge"
5579,Hash House A Go Go,4,Already did a review. This place is still awesome!! My food was amazing. This time went for a late nite druken trying to sober up meal!!! This is the only location i have been to. I love it here. This is a Vegas must go to!! Good for families or the drunk trying to sober up!! The ribs were amazeballs!! Never can go wrong with Hash House!
5580,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I visited for brunch on a Saturday during a girls trip to Vegas recently. The wait was quite long, over an hour I believe, but once we sat, service was quick and friendly. 

We all had Bloody Mary's, which were really tasty and the spice level was perfect. We ordered and shared three dishes- Chicken and Waffles, the Salmon 'Benedict' and fried chicken 'Benedict.' Each dish was MASSIVE... I'm not exaggerating, no one human should consume all of this food unless you're literally starving! My favorite was the chicken and waffles, the waffle was really tasty and the bacon infused syrup was amazing. On the other hand, my chicken 'Benedict' was a bit of a disappointment. I found absolutely nothing wrong with it, but it was't a Benedict ( it was fried chicken onto of a huge biscuit and mashed potatoes) and it was very one-note. Especially given the size, I found it hard to even make a dent in it due to the bland nature of all elements. The chicken was ok, but a little dry and did't have any distinct kick. The mashed potatoes just tasted like a baked potato that had been smashed with no flavor and the biscuit was good, just didn't really add anything to the big pile of blandness. There was a ton of sauce spread on top, I'm not entirely sure what it was, but it seemed like a gravy with some sort of spice added, but that too was surprisingly bland.

There was definitely the potential for this meal to be great, but there needs to be more flavor.. more textural variation.. a kick! I would rather be given a more reasonable portion and for the dish to have more of a flavor dynamic."
5581,Hash House A Go Go,4,"As a person who doesnt like to waste money, or enjoy crappy food.  I always like to try new places out especially in Vegas and when I  randomly came across this place so I was instantly kind of skeptical.  Especially since it was located in imperial palace and i hadnt really noticed a major advertisement for it before. If you've ever seen a Great and glorious fast food ad on tv or online with the delicious mouth watering food and then once you get there and take your order it looks like someone beat your burger with their fist and just flung it in a bag and you was hungry half an hour later and you spent $20-30.
Well Once i googled a few images and menu I figured why not try it out. I didnt post a picture because my pictures will look just like everyone elses or I can say just like their appear on any internet search. Definitely not a false advertisement on that. This has by far been one of my Top places to go to in Vegas and Chicago regardless of the day, time or week. I have tried the majority of the menu or seen a friend try it like the burgers the size of your head stuffed wit mash or what ever else, the Dinner plate sized tenderloin sandwich, Chicken & waffles, the Kokimo and a few more.. Definitely worth the wait in line, the money and the couple hours spent trying to finish.
The only reason It wasnt 5 stars was because I'm a super harsh critic and a place would have to be the greatest thing on earth for 5 stars (or maybe i'm nitpicking) but I'm just saying little super minor things could be better like saying out of 10 its a 9.8
This place how ever is very very close: Good food, Not to much on the pockets, will have left overs, good service, good atmosphere, hope they'll add more to the future menu

Major Rule #1: Try not to eat ANY! thing before coming here.. Even on an empty stomach you may not finish it all but give it try anyway
Major Rule #2: Try not to eat here BEFORE! going out on the town..  you'll probably be to full to drink, dance, hang out an/or just sleepy as hell, full an ready to lay down"
5582,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I LOVE this place! Every morning in Vegas I wake up tweeting to get there! Lol. The food is great , large portions at reasonable prices. The only downfall is the wait...... Any given day is a 30-60 minute wait. But, it's worth it........ I have tried a lot of things, and it all was good. Don't miss out on it. The location is kind of hidden. You can take the monorail to Harrahs's and walk over to Linq and you will be right there ."
5583,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food here tastes awesome!!!! I did go a little over a year ago. But will be going to Vegas in a couple of weeks and definitely going to go here again!
5584,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We had a party of 15-20 people and some of us were lagging.  We tried to reserve a table and half of us wanted to get seated and eat already, but the staff wouldn't allow it.  Their rule is so lame.  So they say by seating everyone at the same time, it will allow them to give the best service where everything is organized and food all comes out together so their service won't get messed up.  I just think that this is another way of saying they don't know how to multi-task.  Just sayin.  Oh, and my friends were pissed about this stupid rule!  Having to wait for people with a hungry stomach is the worst! 

Anyway, finally we got sat and ordered...

Everything my friends and I ordered looked incredibly good and mostly huge in portions.  We did it family style where we tried each others' food.

Fried chicken bacon waffles were bomb.
Corned beef hash was okay, but I wouldn't order that again.  The portion size was small.
Sage fried chicken benedict looked mouth watering and it tasted good too.
French fries were devoured in a heart beat.
Caesar salad was so plain and small; I wouldn't get that again.
The ribeye was huge and delicious.  
Kiwi water lemonade w/ alcohol was good.  Make sure the waiter brings you one with alcohol in it if you order it.  There's a virgin type too, and the waiter had initially brought me this one.  Major fail!  And the drink is either not that strong or the sweetness of the drink masks the taste."
5585,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is the beginning of my second century of reviews so I  giving them the benefit of the doubt, star-wise. There is nothing terrible here, and I even found the corned beef to be tasty. I think it was the combination of very high expectations and a rather, hmmm, eclectic menu. Sometimes a guy just wants breakfast! Ok, they did have this, but it was a small entry that took me a little while to even find.

We got seated quickly but our waitress left a little to be desired. She was nice enough but we got our coffee in paper cups and never got a refill. I decided on the corned beef hash, but wasn't keen on the Swiss cheese. I asked to have it left out, but our waitress actually insisted that it stayed. Now I know you are thinking, ""sour grapes,"" and there is a bit of that; however, I was also tired and really didn't want to start anything, so I finally agreed. You know what? I DIDN'T like it. The beef was completely coated with greasy cheese. Yuck.

Another thing. I expected a place with the word 'hash' in the title would have had lots of hashes. Nope, there were four and then not even hash browns! 

We received no coffee refill offers, but the waitress with her instant credit card machine stood uncomfortably close to me while I completed the tip entry. I am sure that customer tipping in parts of casino hotels can be tight, but come on, back off!

So in a nutshell, it was breakfast. If you are staying in the hotel, it is perfectly adequate, but don't walk a long distance, it isn't worth it."
5586,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This place is really popular in San Diego. My husband and I have been trying to eat at the one in San Diego for a really long time but the wait is always so long. 

We were in Vegas this weekend with Family and wanted to finally try it.  It was located inside Imperial Palace on a 2nd floor of the hotel. Imperial Palace is not the nicest hotel but when you finally make it to the restaurant the decor is nice and the restaurant is pretty big. 

My husband ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and we both shared it. We specifically wanted to try it because we saw it on Man vs. Food and saw Adam try the dish. The dish is definitely way too big for one person so sharing is a MUST when you go to Hash house.  It was very tasty and the chicken is not oily so it was a plus for me!  The presentation of the dish was definitely cool:).  The waiter said the wait for the food after we ordered was 45 minutes since it was made from scratch but  it came out after only waiting for 10 minutes. 

3- stars for the service for me. My husband ordered a bloody mary and they completely forgot about it and we ended up cancelling it all together. 

I really liked the food so I think I will try it again in San Diego."
5587,Hash House A Go Go,3,My friends raved about this place but I think my expectations were too high. Wait time was long but service was good. The waitress was very attentive with making sure we were okay and continuously refilling our drinks. The portions are huge. The chicken and waffles order was a mountain and definitely can feed 2-3 ppl easily.
5588,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We caught a show at the imperial palace, so this was a natural choice.  our experience was clearly different than most other reviewers.  We were seated and served quickly and the food was beautifully presented and with generous portions.  Loved my duck breast entree, and my wife enjoyed her crab cakes.  A tall bottle of Chimay Ale was a bargain, and just slightly more expensive than retail.  Our waiter was personable and attentive, and the rest of the staff was nice as well.  Will definitely return!"
5589,Hash House A Go Go,3,This is my first time here. Glad to say they had a diamond line so I did not have to wait. Food is pretty good. The wait time for the food took really long that's why I have 3 stars .
5590,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The HHAGG is located in the Imperial Palace, which has nothing imperial about it and certainly isn't a palace.  It's the casino in hiding; used to have big street frontage which has been replaced with retail stores and is nothing more than a driveway entrance on the strip.  I find the casino tacky and loud (not in a good way) with its performing dealers dressed like Elvis, Marilyn etc.  They're more interested in performing than being good dealers.  That's a rant for another time.

There is almost nothing not to love about this place.  This experience is based on our mid afternoon ""brunch"" at a time when the restaurant had few patrons, as such we were seated promptly and our waitress prompt and very pleasant.

You have to love this operation; large menu, some weird combinations, HUGE portions and reasonable pricing.  I had Corned Beef hash with eggs ($12.95), potatoes, fresh fruit and a very good biscuit, served in a hot cast iron pan.  The CB Hash was great with the large chunks of meat and everything was delicious.  

Is this a great moment like when you're in a favorite restaurant and breakfast finally arrives?  No, this place makes dishes that are a happening.   I'd love to work my way through everything on their menu (I love breakfast) but this is an ""experience"" rather than a great meal.   No normal person (I'm a BIG eater) can finish what they serve. But man, it's so Las Vegas; over the top and good too.

A fun place to go if you love to eat (to those that don't, PLEASE call your therapist immediately), and you'll save a fortune not being in the casino. Gambling versus eating; hmm...give me a minute to think that about that!"
5591,Hash House A Go Go,5,"To start off my review for anyone glancing at it- 
HUGE PORTIONS SHARE A PLATE!!!

This was my first time here and I was really excited to go. I have heard all about this place: especially the one in San Diego where we are from but have never been. The wait is always really long- but now I know why people wait!!

The atmosphere is very hip and cool. All the servers are then selves with some pretty cool and crazy hair styles! Our server was very nice- it was definitely a full house in their but he was as attentive as he could be.

Food-I was tornnnnn between the chicken and waffles or the combo with one of those big flapjacks- well I went with the combo! It came with eggs, ham, and I upgraded my flapjack to the Brown Sugar Banana one- TOOOOO DIE FOR SO GOOD!!!! Portions were huge as I mentioned!!! It's nice because you can have everyone try some of your food and still have plenty left over!!! The other favorites at the table were the man vs food- looked great and the chicken and waffles- really good, and they actually stuff the waffle with BACON!!! Never seen that before!!

The bloody Mary's were good too! Came with two olives and a small pickle- could of used a little more spice but it was still yummy! 

Overall a great restaurant- huge portions but delicious food- give it a try. You won't be disappointed, but you may wait a bit for the giant servings!"
5592,Hash House A Go Go,3,"***** Response to Manager Brannon ****

Thank you for your input. You might have missed the point of my comment, which was not whether you advertise gravy as a side, its about your server offering it to my wife and then not telling her there would be a charge for it. Yes, further on down the menu, gravy is listed with a bunch of other sides, although none of them have a price next to them. so to review, we never asked about gravy, the server offered it to us, in a way that made it seem as if gravy was an option.  Please consider advising your wait staff if they are going to offer to add items to a customer's meal, they should at least have the courtesy to advise them they will be charged extra if they choose to do so. We thoughtlessly assumed nobody would charge us for a small bowl of gravy, because I have never been to a place that had the stones to do it.  
This way, I wont have to subtract the 4 dollars from your servers tip for not telling me about a surprise charge which is what I did on my visit. thanks. Now, for you yelpers, my short review of  Hash House A Go Go starts below:

 We were ripped off. We ordered the sage chicken and the bacon scramble. The waitress asked if we wanted gravy with our meal and my wife and I said yes. She conveniently left out that there is a $4 charge for each little cup of gravy. I really liked my sage chicken but my wife said her scramble was nothing to brag about."
5593,Hash House A Go Go,4,"WARNING: Portions are large enough for 3 people per plate. If you finish an entire plate on your own, make sure you have plans to walk around the strip or be active because if you don't keep moving, you might  slowly slip into a food coma.

Thankfully our cab driver gave us the warming above before we went to Hash House or else we would have made terrible mistakes noted above. 

Between 5 of us, we shared a chicken & waffles - which EVERYONE needs to try. Bacon layered waffles and multiple pieces of this crispy, sweet fried chicken. Enough for 3-4 people easily! We also got one of the hash dishes but it wasn't as good as the fried chicken & waffles. 

Our server was great but the runners bringing food gave one of our plates to another table and then when we told him, he said ""no you are wrong"" and walked around. Very rude and short, which we nicely explained to our waiter when he came to check in a few minutes later. He immediately got his manager involved and they got us the missing plate as soon as possible then apologized numerous times. 

Even the bloody mary is enormous - served with bacon and a piece of toast!

TIP: Make sure that you go early or at an off time because we had an almost 2 hour wait at 11am on a Saturday. Luckily the casino is just underneath the restaurant so we spent time having mimosas and playing slots. 

This is more of a 3.5 star review but the way the manager swooped in and took care of us pushed it to 4 stars. You should GO GO to Hash House!"
5594,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Agree with Hang T.:  too much tasteless food on the chicken and waffles order. I dug at my plate trying to find the perfect bite and it never happened. The ""bbq sauce"" rimming the plate was just plain nasty. Where was the syrup to drown this crap in???

My friends, however, got an appetizer with steak that was like a normal-sized plate. If you're staying near Imperial and go to here, stick with the appetizers and don't expect much.....and you should be fine.

(I saw a burger go by and it LOOKED good...maybe split one with someone? But I heard the 24 hour Burger Palace is better.)"
5595,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was worth the wait, but that wait was CRAZY! My wife and I got a ""twisted"" burger which came with 2 patties stuffed with mashed potatoes and bacon.  We also got the chorizo, jalapeÃ±o, and cheddar hash and the cinnamon banana pancakes ( which were the size of both of our heads). It was enough food for 4 people...Trust me when I say that we can throw down on some good eating. Can you say, ""delicious-ness?"""
5596,Hash House A Go Go,4,"After we place our orders, we start getting nervous.

Two plates come out of the kitchen. The waitress is obviously having wrist issues carrying them. What looks like eggs benedict is placed in front of another diner. I watch as he panics, having prepared no strategy for a serving of these proportions. 

I start to panic: I ordered the eggs benedict, too. We should have shared something, we lament. 

A couple has chicken and waffles deposited before them. It has a huge steak knife impaled through the mountain of it. It appears they are pulling out their phones to bid their family members goodbye. Or to take pictures. They might not make it through this.

I had asked our waiter about the ""fresh-squeezed"" orange juice. His response is the reason why he's awesome: ""the box SAYS 'fresh-squeezed,' but ain't nobody back there squeezing oranges."" Thank you, Lonzo. I'll have the lemonade.

And then. Our food. Arrives. 

Just as I had feared: a bed of potatoes topped with 2 dense biscuits, topped with poached eggs, topped with a slightly spicy sauce of heart-attack doom. I look at the boy; he has his own concerns. I can almost see him beyond the pile of meat hash deluxe-ness before him. I tell him I love him before we start in.

A few pathetic minutes later, we've done all we can. Lonzo knows the symptoms. Still, he refills my bottomless hand-squeezed lemonade, later providing a to-go cup when it becomes obvious I have no more stomach room to give. 

In my deliriously bursting state, I think back to an innocent time, before we placed our orders. To all of the things we had planned to do that day, the shops we would visit and the sights we were going to see. It had once seemed possible. Now we just want to live to see beyond our stomachs again. Every day it gets a little better."
5597,Hash House A Go Go,1,Nope. Don't go. Overrated overpriced. Super long waits and the biscuits are terrible.
5598,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The portions are huge! Like, really big. So if you're prepared to gorge on $20 chicken and waffles this is your spot. I do not recommend if you're looking to sit somewhere and catch up. They are all about volume, quick in and quick out. Our server was great, and the place was easy to find."
5599,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Huge Portions and amazing food.

Their fried chicken is the best in the business...You can to check out their chicken and waffles.

Hands down the best thing is this magic dipping sauce.  It's like: cheese, mayo, and love...fantastic!!"
5600,Hash House A Go Go,5,This is a late post (went in late May).  This was an experience. We split a pot-pie and it could have fed 4 people.   Yum... highly recommend.
5601,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I frequent this establishment in different areas more than I can count.  Hands down my all time favorite restaurant to hangout after a good workout, a night at the club, or to enjoy a family meal. 

I seem to have an affinity to their s'mores hot chocolate; it has the right compilation of chocolate, marshmallows and gramcracker, it makes me feel warm inside just like a welcoming hug. I devoured the chorizo omelet.  Oh, by the way, every plate on the menu is shareable.  I could have licked my plate clean but there was just plenty to share so I had to take it home. This omelet is comprised of a good ratio of eggs, chorizo,  and plenty of vegetables with a zesty sauce that makes all of the ingredients come together. 

There are plenty more on the menu to choose from so go to town! The menu is your oyster, have a fling of spontaneity,  I'm sure they will not disappoint."
5602,Hash House A Go Go,5,Man the food is so good here. Had the chicken and it was off the hook. Friends had the burger and BBBLT that was in their words killer. You must come hungry and bring friends to share because we could not finish even a half and it was so good we wanted to just keep eating
5603,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Sometimes you just get a craving for some very heavy breakfast food. That's how we ended up at this 50s looking chain diner. It was comfortable enough, although quite dim at the same time.

In an effort to reinvigorate myself for the evening festivities, I ordered a doubleshot espresso, but the coffee was rather terrible. The strawberry lemonade was better.

$15 Corned Beef Hash, red onions, Swiss cheese, w/ 2 eggs, fresh fruit garnish, homemade biscuit:
Not bad, not great. The salty corned beef sat on top of a superfluous bed of potatoes. I broke the over easy eggs on top of the hash and that made for a very filling breakfast meal. Garnished with some rosemary, the biscuit, however, was quite dense and dry.
Considering the name, I had to get some type of hash to see if it lives up to its name.

$20 Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles - 2 fried chicken breasts w/ hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks:
The fried chicken was quite good, but in a lot of bites, there was more mealy batter than there was chicken. I didn't think it needed the hot maple reduction, since all the chicken sits on top of a waffle that is a bit sweet already. The waffle was not bad at all. It was thick and fluffy, with just a little bit of crunch.

The portions are huge and definitely satisfactory, but no great qualities to speak of. On top of that, there is no bathroom in this location. You have to exit your way through the stairs and go past the zebra in the building to use the bathroom. Even if there was a bathroom, the food is alright."
5604,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Always love this place for the yu mines of food and the portions are huge.  This location, as usual is popular so expect to wait a little.  Well
Worth it though. Prices are a little better then most for the strip! Wait staff was friendly. 

I got a scramble and it was really good. I picked the grilled mashed (potatoes) and there was no way I could even think of finishing them. The portion was hugeeeee.  Check out the pic I will post.  They were really good. Just wish I could eat more.  Try this place for sure."
5605,Hash House A Go Go,5,Every time I go to Vegas this is a must spot to go to! The food is awesome especially after drinking. The grilled cheese was absolutely amazing and the fries are just wow! They are also known for their chicken and waffles.. If you're drinking or not make sure to come here and eat you won't be disappointed!
5606,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Came here about a few weeks ago and I was so excited to come here because I mean come on now..the pics on Yelp look amazing. 
So we take the escalators up to the place and damn it was hot. I couldn't breathe. They had one big fan right in the front but no air condition or fans in the actual restaurant. 
We were about to leave but decided that we were already there so let's just deal with it. 
The waitress we had was so so so sweet and friendly. She made the experience better by being enthusiastic about her job and having a good attitude. 
I honestly don't even remember the names of the dishes we ordered. 
The biscuits they started us with was huge. It was drizzled in honey and it was good. 
The chicken sandwich I ordered was good. I believe it was a bbq one that had onion rings as a topping. It was so big! The fries that it came with had this crispy exterior and I loved the fries so much. I thought it was interesting, and by interesting I mean horrible, that condiments are an extra charge. I wanted ranch to eat the fries with but they were gonna charge extra so I said no. 
The burger that was ordered was sent back because it tasted so bland. Like unseasoned meat with cheese and veggies on top. It Wasn't tasty. 
Maybe we just ordered the wrong things that day. I don't know. If I'm ever in the area I might go back and try something else."
5607,Hash House A Go Go,1,"It seems like all CET properties and they're dining options are going Very downhill and this place too! Located inside the quad which is basically imperial palace renamed... 

This is for today's experience and we left before ordering it was that bad. First asked for a booth and were informed that section is closed ... It was literally 2ft away from the open section ! Fine we sat somewhere that was open. Then asked our waitress who came around 10 minutes after we were seated ( place was Very slow and 3 different waiters passed by) I asked her if we could order from the dinner menu as hubby wanted ribs ( it was like 330 pm ) She proceeded to look and speak to us as if we just asked her the dumbest thing on the planet... Said NO dinner starts at 5! If you want to look over the lunch menu or bye .. Basically told us to leave ... This is almost as good as the experience at planet dailies ... Not sure which was worse. So left there feeling insulted and unhappy. So thanks for ruining what could of been a nice lunch..

Take your money and business elsewhere unless you're too drunk to care how you're treated then it may be ok!"
5608,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My brand-new (we got married the night before at the Vegas sign) husband and I both ordered our own plate of the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  It was absolutely one of the best things I've ever had to eat. 

I have got to figure out how they made the maple syrup reduction so I can have it again someday. 

We still have dreams about their chicken and waffles to this day.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can eat there for like.. every meal."
5609,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Let me preface this by saying I love Hash House... the one in San Diego. The one in Las Vegas has left me sooo disappointed. 

I was expecting a wait, so the wait did not upset me. What upset me was the food. Yes, the portions are still monstrous. But the food is not fresh. Part of the appeal with the Hash House for me and my beau is the freshness of the food. 

In Vegas we sat down, ordered, and I kid you not, 5 minutes later we had our food. Ick... The bread tasted stale, the potatoes were luke warm, the chicken had seen better days... I could go on. We ate our food and went along our merry way. 

For what it is it's ""OK,"" for the quality I've experienced from their SD location, this place was a huge disappointment."
5610,Hash House A Go Go,5,You have to get there early or late during ten-to-one it's packed you have to wait at least 20 minutes to half an hour. The food was great order the French toast was cooked perfectly with grilled banana including skin. First time I had grilled bananas skin was cooked perfectly mixed with the French toast. The portion is huge so if you're not a big eater you might want to share a plate.
5611,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMG - I have never been to Hash House a Go-go before.  I am now a lifelong loyal hard core fan!!!!

I had been hearing amazing things about the place for a few years and decided I just HAD to go last time I was in Vegas.  We went for breakfast and arrived around 10:00 or 10:30.  The line was HUGE!  Out the door, standing room only in the waiting area, back to back kind of line.  We took the number we were given and with a wait time estimate of ""about an hour"" went down to the casino to lose some cash while we waited.  

After about 30 minutes we went back upstairs to the standing room only section and waited about 20 more minutes until a seat on one of the benches opened.  We sat down and waited another 30  minutes for our names to be called.  BE PREPARED TO WAIT!!!!!  The wait is long but IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT!

The place has an awesome ambiance.  They have several different dining areas all with a different feel.  They have tons of wait staff all wearing awesome and fun socks.  The abundance of wait staff makes your wait time for re-fills or condiments close to zero.  The food took awhile to get out but we were warned about that when we were seated because of how busy it was.

The food is actually artwork!  I got a BLT that was the size of a toaster with a huge piece of sage sticking out of it.  It was amazing and delicious.  When I got the bill for it I actually laughed out loud.  I had been in Vegas for 4 days now and had paid WAY too much for subpar food - this food was AWESOME and comparably super cheap - great value!!!!!!!!

I am told Hash House a Go-go has a couple of locations in different cities - I will make sure to go for a visit every time I am in one of those cities!

Go to Hash House and ENJOY!!!!  5 Stars for food, price, wait staff and every thing else!"
5612,Hash House A Go Go,4,Ordered a BBBLT to share with my husband and it needed more bacon. They waiter said it should have 8 pieces of bacon but we didn't know that until after we ate it so who knows how much bacon was in it :p overall it was a great sandwich and the fires were good too. The portions are HUGE so just be aware of that. The Bloody Mary was good but a bit spicy.
5613,Hash House A Go Go,1,"TWO WORDS: FOOD POISONING!!!

This is my bf's favorite breakfast place. I had never been. The wait was about an hour. He told me it would be worth it. NOT.

I ordered scrambled eggs with goat cheese that came with a side of potatoes and warm biscuits. It looked delicious. It lacked seasoning. I don't know if it was the goat cheese or the strawberry spread that I put on my biscuits, but less than an hour after walking out of there I had terrible stomach cramps. 

I bought pepto bismol at a convenience store and took one after another to help with the stomach pains. I was stuck in my hotel the rest of the day & night.  It ruined my time in Vegas.

I really think it was the strawberry spread that had been sitting on the table. Maybe it was contaminated with bacteria from lack of refrigeration."
5614,Hash House A Go Go,3,Always a good treat whenever we are in Vegas. They do not have any back home in Los Angeles so it is a must have whenever we want a late night snack. Everything they serve are huge portions and definitely fill you up. One plate can be shared by 2-3 people. I usually go for either pancakes (bigger than your head) or the Fried Chicken (Man vs. Food). I tried the pork chops before and it was pretty good as well. Each dish is pretty heavy so be prepared to feel sluggish afterwards.
5615,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We have tried several times to get into the Hash House a Go Go but it was so crowded in the past we opted for somewhere else. Well today was different! We got up early and only waited about 20 minutes got our table. By the way, they won't seat you unless your entire party is there. It was worth the wait! We both enjoyed the Tractor Driver Combo breakfast and I opted for the Blackberry and Granola flapjack. The breakfast was huge and delicious.  Service was quick and friendly too."
5616,Hash House A Go Go,5,Stopped by for late night break at 0100 hrs and had steak and eggs. $14.00 steak and eggs were gr8t. Hollar..
5617,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So good for brunch. I have previously went to the location at the M Hotel, located south before the strip. The menu provides Indiana style plates. This time around I ordered the chicken and waffles and Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. Both hit the spot for flavor. The pineapple mimosa is great to compliment your meal. Hash House A Go Go is best for sharing. No one should order two of the same because it's best to have everything at the table different to get a variety from the menu. You and your friends can create your own mini buffet at your table. Family style - yummy!!! 

Quick tip - waiting time isn't so bad, but to make it interesting, I suggest to order a Bloody Mary."
5618,Hash House A Go Go,1,Terrible food and service. Even the manager didn't help with my cold and tasteless food. Don't recommend.
5619,Hash House A Go Go,5,This was our best breakfast of our trip. The pancakes are a must order. But be warned they are about 24 inches in diameter. That is like a medium pizza. 2 people can share. The service was excellent and all he food was amazing.
5620,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My husband and I saw this on the food network. They have very large portions, and a good variety of dishes. Expect to pay a higher price just for breakfast, and about a 30-60 minute wait on the weekends. The food was good, but I wouldn't consider it the best breakfast I've had. I've had much cheaper, and much better."
5621,Hash House A Go Go,4,"HOW I GOT STARTED WRITING YELP REVIEWS

In the spring of 2012 I went to my cousin's bachelor party in San Diego. Prior to that I had only written one Yelp review. Since the San Diego trip was going to be pretty expensive, due to the itinerary, I decided to write Yelp reviews of the places that I visited. At that time I didn't think I would constantly write Yelp reviews during these last two years? One of the places I ate in San Diego was Hash House A Go Go. I ordered a salmon omelet. The one regret I made was that I didn't order the sage fried chicken and waffles after seeing some of the customers eating this dish.

Yesterday morning I ate here. Despite the item that was featured on Man vs. Food, I knew what I wanted - the sage chicken fried and waffles. As I remembered in San Diego the portions were huge. To my surprise there were small slices of bacon inside the waffles. As the saying goes everything is better with bacon. I couldn't give this rating a perfect 5-star because of the fried chicken. Despite its crunchy skin the breast meat was slightly dry. Overall I liked the dish because you get what you pay for due to the huge portions. Unlike the last time I went to San Diego location I had no regrets."
5622,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We absolutely loved this place! The food was amazing, huge portions, so plan on sharing. The wait time was about an hour, but totally worth the wait. We will definitely return here on our next trip to Vegas! A must stop place for anyone visiting!"
5623,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict cause it was one of the waiter's faves and I enjoy a good egg benedict. THIS IS NOT AN EGG BENEDICT and shouldn't be called ""benedict"" anything. The egg isn't even runny (idk if it's supposed to be or not here, but it is for normal benedicts). This is basically a pile of carbs with a little bit of meat, little bit of veggies, and a TON of chipotle cream. There was way too much chipotle cream for my liking and it kinda makes me sick to think about it. All I could taste was chipotle cream. It was hard to find and taste my fried chicken...I mean, shouldn't it be a big part of the dish since it's in the name

Although most large quantity places don't have the greatest food, I think HH is slightly better than most large quantity type places. I'd give it 3 stars if it didn't make me sick to think about it..."
5624,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Well worth the wait!

Hash House A Go Go is a place you must eat at when in Vegas. I had the chicken and waffles and it was by far the best I've had. My friend had chicken eggs benedict and that was good also. We washed it down with a pineapple mimosa and that was refreshing. The portions are big enough that 2 people can eat off one plate. 

I love love love this place and will be back to eat here every time im in Vegas!"
5625,Hash House A Go Go,5,"OMFG.

Like seriously, omfg.

I had to have texted my friend just those four letters at least 5 times because this place was better than I could have imagined.
This was seriously one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Ever. 

My boyfriend & I saw this place on one of the tourist channels in the hotel and they mentioned it had been featured on Man vs. Food. Now, we both enjoy watching that show but have never had the opportunity to try one of the places where Adam has gorged himself so we knew that we simply had to try this place before we went back home. And in my opinion, it could not have been better.

First, I had fairly low expectations for this place because it is in a pretty seedy looking casino on the strip. I mean, I had never even heard of the Imperial Palace let alone knew that it had such an awesome restaurant hiding inside. Also, it was known for having huge portions which typically means to me that the food is going to be just ok.

I was totally wrong.

The restaurant itself is actually very nice compared to the rest of the casino. It's really spacious and clean, and they play AWESOME music. Also, aside from your average orange juice, they offer tangerine juice. WHO ELSE DOES THAT!? No one, that's who.
My boyfriend and I were already loving it just from those two things. 

For breakfast I ordered the Tractor combo which I got with two over easy eggs, sausage and the Brown Sugar Banana pancake.
That's right. This was no boring old plain whatever pancake with some bananas sliced on top. 
This was a HUGE effing pancake with a beautiful crust of brown sugar goodness with at least two whole bananas cooked into the massive cake. OMFG.
Drool. 
The delicately flavored moist and fluffy cake gently embraced the bananas as they were surrounded by delicious little pockets of crunchy brown sugar. I was a little closer to heaven with each bite. 
The eggs and sausage were also stellar, perfectly cooked with surprisingly very little grease. I was very impressed.

My boyfriend chose the Man vs. Food favorite which was a ridiculous benedict of mashed potatoes and biscuits topped with fried chicken, scrambled eggs, mozzarella cheese and some veggies covered with a chipotle cream sauce. It was HUGE. Definitely the Frankenstein's monster of benedicts if I've ever seen it.
It was also very tasty though. The chicken was delicious, again surprisingly not greasy at all. Especially for fried chicken. The chipotle cream was flavorful with a good amount of heat and all the veggies were super fresh. 

The service was also spectacular. Our waitress was super friendly and our food was brought out very promptly, even though she told us that our dishes may not come out at the same time. She told us they don't use heat lamps so they want everything to be served right when it comes out so it gets to you nice and hot. That is fine with me! 
This place definitely deserves all 5 stars. Great service, fantastic ambiance, amazing food and HUGE portions. 
I will for SURE be coming back to this place as soon as I can. 
I would even drive all the way out to Vegas again just to come to the Hash House, it's that good. Next time I HAVE to try the Chicken & Bacon Waffles. 
Yes. They have bacon waffles. 
OMFG."
5626,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Was really disappointed with this place after reading all the amazing reviews. Everything about it was just mediocre, from the flavor of the food to the slow service. It was our first meal in the city and didn't really give us a great start. Won't be going back and wish we had the same great experience these other reviews had."
5627,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is fantastic!!
Food-Awesome
Cocktails-Awesome
Staff-Awesome
Price-Awesome
You get plenty of food and the place is clean! 
Gary our waiter was amazing, fast and very easy on the eyes. He attitude and kindness was the frosting on the cake!!
**********"
5628,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Yuummmmm. Ok portions here are huge! I think that's what makes them popular, so be prepared! Now, everything here is overpriced... but it's Vegas lol. Everything is high! But the food here is sooo good, so it's worth it! I ordered the chicken and waffles! Sooo good! Mine were vanilla flavored, but they have all kind of unique flavors. And the pancakes are to die for!! They're hugggeee. Large as the plate lol. And so soft, yummy and buttery! This place is a definite must visit! The prices are a bit wee high but again it's Vegas. Oh be sure to order the watermelon lemonade! So much sweetness swirled around in one glass! Wait! Before I forget! You have to self park and I think it was about $12... if your not staying at the hotel, then you have to pay for parking. It's a small walk through the hotel to the restaurant... it's a long walk if you don't like walking lol!"
5629,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We arrived around 9 am with a 15 min wait, the service is slow however it is we'll worth the wait. We ordered the tractor combo which is a great amount of food, the Waffles are large and fluffy, the eggs and potatoes are plentiful, however, the fried chicken and mashed potatoes are the speciality. I would highly recommend at least one person in our party to order those items!! It's a must Go Go !!"
5630,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Does this ever happen to you?
You're in Vegas, hungover to the point where you secretly wish there was immediate access to a loaded handgun. Then you rationalize.
Death won't even cure this hangover, so you go for the next best thing - an eating binge.
Yes, only food and aspirins can help you now. But where to go? So many choices in Vegas. Here's what I do.
Head to The Quad, wind your way down a seemingly endless maze of hallways, up a couple flights of stairs and voila, Hash House a Go Go.

Ask the server for the most popular menu item. She'll be quick to tell you it's the Sage Fried Chicken; a mountainous glob of mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, and of course, fried chicken - all suffocating under a lava flow of spicy, melted cheese. 

Snakelike, I unhinge my lower jaw, loosen my 501's, and begin entertaining curious onlookers with an eating frenzy even Jaws would admire.
High fives from the staff as I waddled out - leaving a smoking trail of beer farts - crop dusting my once cheering adorers who are now face deep in their own piles of food.

I went back to the room to chill, thinking; ""I really could have used that handgun."""
5631,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I've been wanting to try out this place for a year now and was finally around on a Saturday night to try it out. It was pretty empty and we did not have to wait in line. The biscuit that they brought us was covered in hunny butter and was pleasantly good. 
I ordered the twister burger #5 which included chesss and avacado in between the 2 patties. I was expecting more but it just seemed bland to me. I also thought the burgers were way over cookek and the burger was dry and needed some sort of sauce. 
The chicken sandwich was also very dry and needed sauce. The ceasar salad was pretty good and standard - they had 4 prices of crouton looking things on each end of the plate which is something I've never tasted before. 
The portions are massive for what you are paying for. 
Overall, I had higher expectations but was left disappointed for the quality of food. 
Service was good and they also make their own ranch which is a must with their crispy tasty fries!"
5632,Hash House A Go Go,5,Food is simply AMAZING!! Perfect for big parties and PLEASE SHARE!! Plates are big enough for at least 3 ppl to eat off of!
5633,Hash House A Go Go,5,First off gotta give a shout out to Alan! Absolutely the best service my wife and I have ever had at any place in Vegas!!! Ask for Alan!!! CHICKEN AND WAFFLES are amazing!!!! Drop by portions are plentiful so bring your appetite! Definatly will be back every rime we come to town!
5634,Hash House A Go Go,4,Been here two years prior had to come back especially since it in my hotel. Getting the sage fried chicken and eggs. The coffee is good and strong not the typical blah tepid water
5635,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food is SUPER YUMMY and portion size is RIDICULOUSLY RIDICULOUS! We tried the Sage Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict. I definitely recommend u split it because it's HUMONGOUS! A victorious combination of flavors and textures!

Service was great. Hostess was knowledgeable and helpful.

Establishment was clean and tidy."
5636,Hash House A Go Go,5,Long wait but definitely worth it. Food was delicious and prices were cheap compared to other eateries on the strip.
5637,Hash House A Go Go,5,The sage chicken snd waffles lived up to the hype! Waffles had bacon cooked into it. The regular breakfast included mashed taters which were awesome. Portions were huge and everywhere I looked were half eaten dishes.
5638,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It was good, not amazing. The long lines weren't a problem. The concept was cool and holy hell the portions are huge! The food was above average quality for sure. The service wasn't awesome. I actually don't like that they have the tablets to pay on while the server is holding it. I left an 18% tip which is actually pretty low since I'm generally a 20-25% tipper. I bet a lot of people feel weird looking the server in the eye as they hold it and put a 10% tip, when the service didn't deserve more, and that's kinda messed up in my opinion. I didn't like that the ""default option"" tips were 18, 20, and 25%. To tip 15% you had to go to customized tip. Maybe I'm dramatic here, but that's just really uncomfortable for a person to have their server watching you as you tip."
5639,Hash House A Go Go,5,Bomb ass food. You will definitely take some good home as the portions are huge but the prices are right. I also ordered the huckberry drink and it was the best thing I ever tasted.
5640,Hash House A Go Go,5,The food is amazinnnng! My hubby had the red velvet waffle and I had the chorizo hash. So good. We also had the banana pancake on a different visit and it's the best pancake I've ever had and HUGE!
5641,Hash House A Go Go,3,Food was good large portions I got the chicken and waffles and it was more than enough to share. The service was poor and the place didn't feel very clean.
5642,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This restaurant is located inside the Linq hotel and its open 24/7.  There's always a lot of people so prepare to wait if you are dining for breakfast. 

I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. The dish consists of fried chicken with 2 eggs bacon mashed potato and 2 biscuits. It is a very big plate so make sure you share it with 2 people.  For me everything tastes good except for the mash potato. It lacks flavor.  

I will be back soon."
5643,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The food was good, a little pricey; but omg the portion is humongous. I was totally not expecting to have to pack my pancakes to go into a pizza box. They have a few locations and are open 24hours, makes the late-night-after-club-grub-run decision easy. Unfortunately they crowd that stumbles in late night are all drunk and most don't know how to behave. I felt bad for the waiters and waitresses that were working."
5644,Hash House A Go Go,5,"FANTASTIC!

Found this restaurant on restaurant.com and got a $25 coupon for free. Ended up spending $10 for our meal and it was the best $10 I ever spent. In fact, we ended up going twice in our 4 day trip!

Portions are GIGANTIC and that is not sacrificed by the tastiness of the food. I got the tenderloin with mashed potatoes AND biscuit AND egg and it was as large as a computer monitor. Seriously? Wow. 

Amazingly delicious sounding drinks with alcohol and bacon and chocolate. Didn't get any of it but it sounded intriguing. 

We are going back to Vegas in a couple months and absolutely making another stop here."
5645,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I came here for brunch and the line was really long. While we waited we went downstairs and grabbed drinks so it wasn't too bad. 
Can I just start off by saying the portions are HUGE. I ordered the fried chicken and it was so delicious. I think 2-3 people can share this dish and still be full. The fried chicken was crispy but moist inside. It was topped with bacon, eggs and best of all, the creamy (almost gravy-like) sauce. 
Definitely recommend this dish. 
I didn't order the bloody mary myself but my friend did, and just like the fried chicken, it was massive. She ordered the Johnny's BLT bloody mary. It came like an actual BLT but deconstructed. It was tomato-y and full of goodness."
5646,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great food! Gigantic proportions! Best Bloody Mary I have had in town as well as,  the chicken and waffles! Twisted farm food is right! Lol"
5647,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I just found one of my favorite breakfast places on the strip.  Wow!  Big portions and won't put a big dent in your wallet.

I tried my son's meatloaf...EXCELLENT!
I had the HH original eggs benedict (smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs...EXCELLENT!

The griddled mashed potatoes was also EXCELLENT."
5648,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Previous reviewers are all correct on the portions, they are GIANT, too big.  Most people in Vegas are at a hotel and not taking home leftovers so alot of food is going to waste.  They could serve half portion sizes and charge slightly less and probably make more money without all the waste.

That to say, the food, although excessive, was AWESOME!!!  I will definitely be going back to this joint.  I got the Farmhouse Scramble with bacon and avocado with the potato smashers and a side of gravy to eat with my biscuit.  Absolutely delicious.  Eggs were the right texture, not too soft but not overcooked, gravy was thick and good flavor, biscuit was perfect, potatoes were pretty much mashed potatoes so if you don't want those for breakfast, don't get them, but I loved them just fine.  Went great with my bowl of gravy :)

Boyfriend got the french toast and he was equally pleased with his meal.

Only small complaint is there was an hour wait, not a big deal, we expected a wait, so we went down and played at a $5 blackjack table right next to the restaurant.  They told us to come check back in 30 minutes just in case and when we did were told to come back in 20 minutes.  We went back in 20 minutes and they said our table had been ready for 15 minutes.  They could invest in the buzzers to let people know when their table is ready so you can enjoy the casino while waiting without having to go back repeatedly and missing being called.  We were starving and would have been happy to eat 15 minutes earlier and would have lost less money waiting... 

Regardless, highly recommend!!!!"
5649,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Love!!!! 

Biscuits are wonderful!

I got grilled Chicken breast on potatoes with veggies.  It was great!

BF got the tractor combo with the brown sugar banana pancake the size of a record, huge!  

We could not finish anything!!!!

He also got the mint mocha : pass on that.  Pretty terrible unless you absolutely Love mint...

Cheap prices, good quality, good service, love it!!!"
5650,Hash House A Go Go,4,"came here for brunch on a thursday morning and the wait was around 35 minutes. we were seated and we ordered the fried chicken benedict, pot pie, and meatloaf with eggs. the portions are HUGE, so if you are a light eater or can't eat much like me, i recommend sharing one plate with someone else. the three of us all were unable to finish our meals so took it to go. service was good, worth a try for sure!!"
5651,Hash House A Go Go,3,"As I am sure is the case with many, my boyfriend and I were made aware of this place through the Travel Channel's Man v. Food show.  The host visited the Hash House a Go Go on Sahara, and he tried the fried chicken eggs benedict.  My boyfriend was hooked--when we went to Las Vegas at the end of last month, he insisted upon a visit.

Fortunately for us, we discovered that there is a second location in the Imperial Palace, which was right down the street from where we were staying.  In order to check on the times when certain food is served, my boyfriend repeatedly tried to call them with no answer at least the first two times.  

The restaurant is easy to find at the back of the casino and up a specifically designed escalator.  There is plenty of room to wait with seating for customers, and we only had to wait for about 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon around 12.  The hostess staff, presumably the same group that ignored our phone calls, were a little unprofessional, preferring to congregate and gossip rather than seat patrons or help in the dining room.  

The atmosphere in this restaurant is TERRIBLE.  The walls were covered in this industrial metal sheeting, which made it look like a warehouse.  It also amplified the noise in the room, which would have been invasive even without this design flaw.  It is clear that this restaurant is designed to make people feel uncomfortable enough to eat and leave as quickly as possible.  Clearly this worked as no patrons I observed lingered over their ample meals.

Waitstaff was friendly, but service was a little oblivious.  It took 20 minutes to actually receive a bar drink, and I think we saw our waitress three times during the entire experience.  We also lacked silverware.

The food was pretty good.  The sizes definitely live up to the hype.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was huge.  The bread was the best part--it was homemade and thickly sliced.  The chicken should have been in smaller chunks, though, and it was a little tough, however, the combination of light mayo and tomatos really did add something to the sandwich.  The side salad had clearly been sitting in the fridge a bit too long and should have been discarded rather than served, but the cucumber dressing was a very refreshing accent.  

The best entree by far was the fried chicken eggs benedict, which did not disappoint.  It was huge, layered with fried chicken, eggs, fried cheese, biscuits, and mashed potatoes, and topped with chipolte cream sauce.  It was an amazing combination and a huge entree.

This is definitely worth a visit, but it may not be worth a return."
5652,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Portions were way too big and the line was 1 hr on average.  Food was good, but did not give the wow factor. It was A-OK."
5653,Hash House A Go Go,5,It was delicious! Portions could satisfy 3 people! Come here hungry.... share a plate and prepare to take home leftovers!
5654,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The food is amazing!! We had the corned beef hash, stuffed meatloaf, fried green tomatoes, pork Benedict! I love everything about it and our waiter was the best he was supper helpful and friendly! The best customer service I've had in a while ("
5655,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you're staying at LinQ Hotel Hash House A Go Go is a great place to eat.  The portions are HUGE & DELISH 2 persons can share a plate of goodness. The prices are good for the yummyness and portion you get.  

I had the meatloaf dinner.  Sons had Double Burger # 1 & 5. My husband had the original breakfast with pancakes.  I can only imagine what the other dishes on menu taste like.  We will just have to come back and taste :)

Wait time to be seated can take a bit; however, if you're not in a hurry be patient and wait because what awaits you is DELISH!!!  Service is good, attentive. 

The only thing I don't care for is the music can be a little loud.  Then again, I'm in Vegas:)

Viva Hash House a Go Go!!!"
5656,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Thought it was great food. Creative, tasty, huge portions. Would go again."
5657,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Wow.. Generous portion chicken and waffle.
In side of rest, it was not fancy but you should stop here if you are in vegas.
My husband and i shared one small salad, chicken and waffle and huge watermelon cocktail. Chicken was so crispy and crispy bacon was inside waffle. Free biscuit was so soft and delicious.
Foods were so tasty and staffs were so friendly.
Dessert looked so delicious but we were too full to try it. Too bad.."
5658,Hash House A Go Go,3,"It's quite dark and dingy...more of a downtown vegas vibe than on the strip. The food is pretty good and the portions are HUGE. Definitely look to share at least two people to one order. Service was fine at the beginning but it became really really slow towards the end. It took forever to get more water, then it took forever to get the check, then it took forever to get to-go boxes, then it took forever to get the check back to sign...you get the idea. The place wasn't even half full. Overall, this place is a great value. Enjoy!"
5659,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Service was unbearably slow. Didn't answer the phone when I called about wait times, waited half an hour to sit, food took forever. The food was fine, but definitely go to any other location. There are a few in Vegas."
5660,Hash House A Go Go,4,"How do you follow up a dinner that filled you up to the point of near explosion at Bacchanal the previous night? Have breakfast at Hash House A Go Go!

This was recommended by my friend's co-worker, like Raku (see: my other reviews), and I'd seen it featured on shows such as Man Vs. Food. It also seemed like Yelp liked it, so this place has a pretty good reputation. 

My friends and I arrived there probably at around 11 AM and we had to wait about 20 minutes before getting seated, which wasn't bad at all. I was torn between getting the Fried Chicken Benedict or the Fried Chicken and Waffles. The benedict was listed as a ""Man Vs. Food Favorite"" while the chicken and waffle was listed as a ""NY Times Favorite"". Torn, like Natalie Imbruglia, I went with the benedict. 

My friend ordered a BLT Bloody Mary, and that thing looked almost like a meal in of itself. The gave my friend a crispy piece of toast next to a tall Bloody Mary with a strip of bacon standing up. When asked if it was good, his response was, ""It tasted like a Bloody Mary."" That's hard for a non-drinker for me to understand.

Looking around, we noticed that the portions were huge. The table next to us had ordered flapjacks and they looked like they were about to spill over the sides of the plate. When our food came, we were not disappointed with the portions, but rather, astonished by how big they were. The benedict not only comes with a huge fried chicken breast and a big biscuit split in half, but a large mound of mashed potatoes as well. Needless to say, I knew I would have a hard time finishing this and eventually gave up with still 1/4 of the food on my plate. Flavor wise, the food was very good, though I felt the chicken was a bit dry. Also, once you get really full, everything starts tasting alike, so near the end, everything started tasting like death's sweet embrace to me. No one at our table finished their food.

Our server was super friendly and attentive despite the restaurant being super full. I'd like to try this place again for their Fried Chicken and Waffles, though it may be my last mistake if I try finishing it. Also they don't have a restroom inside the restaurant; it's down the escalator and past the smoothie bar downstairs, just in case you have to pray to the porcelain god to end it all."
5661,Hash House A Go Go,4,my first experience was at the new location at the M resort. All i have to say it was an awesome experience. The food is not like your run of the mill diners.Great atmosphere.Unique and creative dishes. The portions are extremely huge. I was full for 2 days. So you better bring your appetite to Hash House A Go Go
5662,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I love this place. You better have a big appetite, the plates are huge! I eat here, at the Plaza, every time I'm in Vegas. It's a necessity of mine"
5663,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Tanya, most rude unhelpful person on the planet.  Wouldn't answer any questions, very rude attitude, how do you work in the service industry?  You won't last long.  Hash house do something about her; we can't be the only complaint."
5664,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Food was good. I was a bit disappointed that by not getting chorizo with my breakfast I couldn't get black beans, but, whatever. Portions are humongous. My husband and I could have easily shared one dish. We both liked our food. Service was okay. The food came out fast for how busy it was, but our server wasn't very attentive or kind."
5665,Hash House A Go Go,1,Terrible.  The food quality is the worst I've seen in a hotel restaurant in Vegas.  There were four of us and nobody was happy.  Chicken quality is rubbery and blubbery.  Even the side salad has brown spots on the lettuce.  Service was even worse so we had to speak with the manager who was the only positive experience during the evening.  A huge gross let down.
5666,Hash House A Go Go,5,"My wife and I ate there twice during our last trip to Vegas. Once for breakfast and once for dinner, each was one of the most amazing ""comfort food"" meals of my life. The servers were all great and friendly. The wait was a half hour-ish for breakfast and they didn't seem busy at all but we went for an early dinner and there was no wait at 5pm. They do take reservations though. Steve was our bartender/server for dinner and he was very personable and made the best white russian that i've ever had (it was his own recipe). Sit at the bar and ask for Steve! Portions are HUGE too! Prices are very very very reasonable."
5667,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went for Dinner on a Tuesday night , No wait Baby , Had a restaurant.com certificate , No Problem , Asked if they still had The Twitter Free Drink of the Day , No Problem, it was a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer , Never Had it before, well that's off the bucket list . 
Ordered The Meat Loaf Sandwich , Very Good , Mash With Bacon wit Cheddar Holy Shit Batman Awesome!   needed to up the bill to use the certificate , so My Associate & I split The Fruit Cobbler with Vanilla Ice Cream.. Best Part of the Meal.
Food was Great , Service was Excellent 

Also will review The Henderson Hash House@ The M  , Not so Sparkling . 
But 2 thumbs up for The IP Location"
5668,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This was the best meal we had while staying in Vegas. Must get the fried green tomatoes appetizer! Also, I had the GIANT size chicken n waffles - this is a MUST share with someone else! IT was so good and I highly recommend this. My fiancÃ© got the #5 burger and it was very big and delicious - he gets a burger everywhere we go :) The atmosphere was great, food was fantastic, beer was amazing BUT the best part was a server! She was super helpful and I even told the manager how fantastic she was. 5 stars"
5669,Hash House A Go Go,5,Vegas best A must for all come hungry go home happy even my item is great pot pie is my favorite
5670,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is open 24/7! So convenient for us when we were staying at The Quad! Now, I've lived in San Diego for 4 years & I've tried to place & never understood the hype. Yes, huge portions, but mediocre taste.

However, when I tried this place again, I was mindblown by the fried chicken benedict. The infusions of flavor was incredible & not what I was expecting. There's also mashed potatoes underneath it, that are very flavorful! GET THIS!"
5671,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is absolutely somewhere you'll want to visit and easy at when in Vegas... BUT PARKING and finding it is a bitch... see below for tips: The food is spectacular, our waitor was so friendly and informative that he made the Already difficult task at hand... Decide what to eat even more difficult.  Everything at the restaurant is fresh or homemade and flavorful corn beef is not out of the can it is real corn beef, fresh vegetables fresh products and they have a BLT on the rocks..... a bloody Mary with lettuce tomato and bacon! Served with a side of toast!!! 

PARKING AND LOCATING RESTAURANT: If you decide to visit. Follow the directions into the Harrahs and LINQ self parking... Park on the LINQ  hotel Self parking. enter the hotel. And go up one level and you will find the One of the most phenomenal mouthwatering pant expanding flavorful, beyond your wildest imagination breakfast You will have eaten in a long time... soooo yummmmm!!!"
5672,Hash House A Go Go,4,"A good place to go to soak up your morning hangover.  The portions are HUGE and everything is oversized.  Our friends wanted to come here while in Vegas because they had seen it on Man vs. Food (or one of those shows) and we didn't even have to second guess why it was on the show after walking to our table.  Our friends settled on french toast and granola pancakes which were literally the size of tractor tires as they were described on the menu!  DH and I each got the farm scrambles, I the bacon, avocado, swiss, and onion one which was DELICIOUS and him the ham, cheddar, and spinach which he didn't enjoy as much as mine.  Everyone was satisfied with their meals because there was complete silence as we attacked them!  The fried chicken and waffles looked delicious and I'll have to get it next time.  Juice and coffee were good, service was good, all worth a return trip."
5673,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Being open 24 hours! This was a great belly filler at 1 am! The portions are HUGE so please be advised, The whole menu looked divine! I didn't want to have a drink but the huckleberry vodka is a rare find! I had the corn beef hash skillet, i believe and it was awesome! Service was great and must be difficult at that time of night but our server was super great! Be sure to stop in! Any time!"
5674,Hash House A Go Go,5,Yes yes yes I loved this restaurant. I plan on returning before we head back home. Service was spectacular. Food was fresh and extremely tasty.
5675,Hash House A Go Go,5,"So this place is located in an upstairs hidden corner of the used to be Imperial Palace (soon to be The Quad). It is sorta tricky to find, but that does not seem to deter Vegas tourists from visiting this totally fun place. 

We tried to visit on a Saturday morning but were greeted with a 45 minute wait. We were hungry, so we decided to pass this one up and try it again on Monday morning. Still a 35 minute wait, but we really wanted to try it. 

As others have said, once you are seated the service is excellent. The menu has all sorts of fun and unique offerings such as a banana latte and banana and maple sugar pancakes. My boyfriend and I are normally people who walk in and decide what we want fairly quickly, but Hash House's menu boasts so many unique flavors that it took us a while to decide. 

We finally decided that we wanted the sage fried chicken and waffles (apparently a Man VS. Food favorite), some pancakes, and a side of crispy potatoes. The waitress took one look at us (we are not large people) and recommended we wait on the pancakes until we received the rest of our food, as the portions are so good. We appreciated her honesty, because the portions were HUGE and the chicken and waffles and potatoes were more than enough. 

The flavor, texture, and presentation was superb. The sage as a bit of complexity to the chicken flavor that still mixes well with the waffles. The syrup was a little less sweet than most, which makes it perfect with the savory part of the dish. The chicken was also obviously high quality. One of the things I normally hate about fried chicken is the low quality chicken that places sometimes use. 

We fully enjoyed our dining experience. The dishes are so large and tasty looking that it is fun to watch the servers take them to their respective tables and then watch the look on the people's faces as they begin to dig in. We are already planning to visit again on our next Vegas trip, and even want to stop in late night after gambling just for one of their fun lattes."
5676,Hash House A Go Go,5,Located inside the new Linq hotel. The service was fast and food/drink was YUMMMMMY! My man got the chicken and waffles. The waffle had bacon in side and I had the chicken Benedict or something I forgot that had a Cajun cream over it YUM!
5677,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Awesome, upbeat and fun restaurant! I always bring my friends when they are visiting. The food is delicious and enormous! It makes for great conservation and even better pictures! The servers were outgoing, fun and fast! The location of the restaurant is also awesome.. Love this place!"
5678,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Order the Fried Chicken Benedict and Warm Spinach.

The Warm Spinach would have been better if they didn't drench the salad in vinaigrette.  A completely weak $9 salad.  Small with no substance, much like the garbage of a hotel casino this place is located in.  Does anyone else besides me think it's time for place to go?  Imperial Palace?  Come on now, is this place even politically correct?

The Benedict tasted absolutely disgusting.  I enjoy artery clogging goodness as much anyone else but this was just so poorly executed.  So the place had a few biscuits, scrambled eggs, and two fried chicken breast fillet haphazardly lumped together on a plate, drench and I mean completely a quart of sauce drench in some sauce I cannot make out.  Nothing is spared, everything just tasted like this disgusting thousand islands mayo based concoction.  Even if the Fried Chicken was good, there would have no way for me to have known.

I asked if they could change the television channel over to the Oregon Stanford game, I got a yes, but no action.  Of course it's probably random chance with my server and runners but I HATE lip service!  If you're not going to do something of if you don't want to please don't tell me that you will, if not for the absolutely quick response time of Las Vegas Metro I would have stabbed the man in the back with the butter knife.  If you even think that the food is going to take another 15 minutes, why would you tell me it'll be a couple minutes?  Ridiculous!  Must have been at least 45 mins from when we put the order in to when the food came out.  I honestly looking back should have just took my friend's suggestion of walking out and leaving.  I just couldn't tell if he was serious, but knowing him as long as I do, I should have know he was.

I felt so bad for suggesting this place to my good buddy that I gave him my credit card for the night.  I know a lot of people like to come here for the first time because of their huge portion size (which at around $15 -$23 a plate I hardly think is that amazing) but I doubt there are many repeat customers."
5679,Hash House A Go Go,5,This was a delicious stop in Vegas. The chicken and waffles were delicious and I really enjoyed the fried green tomatoes - a good twist from the southern ones I've had. Great spot for a crowd.
5680,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Omg!!! Please go to this amazing restaurant! PJ was our awesome server, and the food...come hungry and expect to be ""wowed!"""
5681,Hash House A Go Go,2,Not sure what's all the hoopla is all about.  I think the food not good.  Had the sage fried chicken.  Dry food thrown together on a messy pile.  Gravy was sweet.  Weird.  Shouldn't it be savory?
5682,Hash House A Go Go,1,Slow terrible service. Waited 30+ for a salad. Would not go back. Food was sitting for a long time.
5683,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing portions of food. Service a little slow but good is great. Skip burger places come here.
5684,Hash House A Go Go,3,"If you're wowed by over the top presentation and foods that will make you instantly gain 10lbs at the table, Hash Hash is for you! If not, take your belly elsewhere. 

BIG portion is an understatement. I'm sure the phrase quantity over quality was epitomized at this place. And there's nothing wrong with it. I was oooing and ahhing as well but when it came down to flavors, they were pretty average. Instead of paying $17 for my average chicken and waffles that I would have to eat over the course of 3 days, I rather pay $12 for a normal plate. Just sayin..."
5685,Hash House A Go Go,5,"After a night of drinking I needed a place to give me back life. I decided to try this place out. The line was ridiculous (45 or more minutes) but we decided to wait (played beer pong in O'Sheas while we waited). I'm so glad we did. I ordered the Man vs Food favorite. It was so good that I didn't want to finish it. Mind you, the portions are MASSIVE. The food took quite some time to come out but at least our waitress was super nice. I was delighted to see they have one in Orlando so I will definitely frequent this restaurant! Must try!"
5686,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Where do i start ?

This is my first review and the first time I have ever been so let down by all the good reviews!

Saw it on tv and it looked great!
Real life, unfortunately, was a let down.

Here are my gripes:
1) had breakfast after 11am. They only serve scrambled eggs after 11.
     for the price they ask, this seems to be a bit lame!

2) pancake was not good!  very tough and very short on flavor!
tough?  i could shingle my roof with them!

3) my 3 eggs and bacon breakfast was $9.00. Not to far out of range   until  you count the bacon!  2 strips of bacon!!
This was not thick bacon, nor was it special bacon!
two strips of thin regular bacon!!

How can they boast about their 1ib burgers and giant pancakes and oversized and overstuffed everything,  and then serve 2 slices of thin regular bacon!

4) dried out biscuit!!  they did not even serve butter and jam with the biscuit!
Do they feel that it was so good that it needed no help?

I do not think that the management ever eats there, or else they would have to know that they are sub par!

Waitress was good though!"
5687,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Seemed tired, dirty. Staff were  all new didn't know drinks available. No menu of drinks.  Food was good. Needs a good cleaning and freshened up."
5688,Hash House A Go Go,5,"They done LOST their minds at Hash House a Go Go. The PORTION size is OUTRAGEOUS!!! The pancakes are the size of a pizza. If you get a chance to eat there, just order ONE of something and SPLIT/SHARE the food. It's Way TOO MUCH for ONE PERSON"
5689,Hash House A Go Go,5,Had a great breakfast of chicken and waffles a couple of days ago! Alan was our server and he was fantastic! Very knowledgeable of the menu and had great suggestions. I will be back because of the great service and food.
5690,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Where do I begin?  Down home waitresses, wonderful food, a cool looking motif in the restaurant..........First time here this last week; won't be my last.
I had the breakfast meal with the chipotle hollandaise sauce.  The amount of food on my plate could have fed me for two days.  A fried chicken breast the size of a small turkey breast.  Huge biscuits. Bacon.  Grilled mashed potatoes..........I'm making myself hungry just typing this
and reliving it in my mind!

You've gotta make this a checkmark on your bucket list!"
5691,Hash House A Go Go,4,"The ever so popular Hash house has two locations now! I don't have to drive off strip to go have some goooood breakfast. The portions here are big, and to be honest, an order can be shared between 3-4 people. So go with friends and order up to be able to try many dishes! Loved the chicken pot pie!!!!!! The service was great, quick and consistent. Shout out to the kitchen staff for their impeccable timeliness!"
5692,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Tired? Haven't slept? Hangover? This is the place you want to be. In a city filled with mountainous buffets and chef-endorsed eateries, sometimes what you really need is a place that serves hearty, down to earth grub. And that is pretty much what you get at Hash House a Go Go. 

I had the fried chicken benedict and it was a monsterous plate of fried goodness. At first, I noticed a huge load of mashed potatoes underneath everything else which made me a little cautious (didn't want to food coma before going on the 5 hour drive back to LA). But surprisingly, the mash was rather light and went really really well with the rest of the dish. My chicken was cooked and fried perfectly with just enough batter for a nice little crunch. The bacon was a nice touch and the sauce they used brought the entire dish together. Overall, the flavors were very harmonious but truthfully, the most amazing aspect is the power of this meal to cure hangovers/ aggravated stomachs. Be it a night of cavalier partying or a low key drink fest, the food here will do more than enough to stop the room from spinning. 

Just be ready to wait a bit and make sure all of your party is present when you put your name down because they won't give you a buzzer until everyone is there. There will definitely be a wait but they have a selection of magazines for you to dive into, assuming you're in a state to read. 

I will say that our waiter was rather rude at times and didn't seem too keen on earning his tip that day. One of my friends was very hungover and in obvious discomfort but the waiter still seemed to think it was necessary to poke constant fun at him; obviously he was joking (I hope) but there's a point where jokes get old and the waiter needs to learn when to stop. Maybe he realized we were getting annoyed because he disappeared for a while and left us to tend to our empty glasses of ice. I don't think it's enough to justify docking any stars but it's worth mentioning. 

Just be ready to come hungry and leave bloated. And make sure to get your poolside time in before you pay a visit because it is unlikely that your hard earned six pack will survive this episode."
5693,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Good breakfast if you're not watching your weight. Service, prices and variety are all OK."
5694,Hash House A Go Go,5,Best breakfast ever! We had the chicken and waffles so so delicious. It was a giant portion so my husband and I shared and we were both stuffed! Our service was top notch our server Gary was awesome! The wait was 45 min but totally worth it. They serve the best bloody Mary's
5695,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Took about 25 min to seat a party of 2 on a Saturday morning around 9am. Brown sugar banana flapjack was awesome, chicken and waffles had a really good flavor loved it. Portions way to big because who reheats pancakes or waffles??? Service was good. Prices are a bit high but the plate is massive so I guess they have to be. For scale chicken and waffles were $17.99 but it was actually two whole chicken breasts and four waffles stacked high"
5696,Hash House A Go Go,3,"My husband and I visited this location on our last morning in Vegas.  I had heard about this joint on man vs. food and I had to check it out!  We arrived at about 8:30, and we had about a 10 minute wait.  Not too bad!!

After that, though, the service got a little spotty.  It took forever for our waitress to come to the table for the first time, we needed to ask for a lot of things twice in order to actually get them (like syrup, napkins, water, PLATES).  It was sort of frustrating in that respect.

But the FOOD.  Oh maaaaaan the food.  My husband and I couldn't decide what to get, so we decided to split three things.  Our waitress sort of tried to talk us out of it saying ""it's a lot of food, you know"".  I said that we were aware--we saw Man v Food.

But anyway, we got the french toast with a side of eggs over hard and bacon, the farmhouse scrambler (chicken and peppers mixed with eggs) and that comes with a biscuit and crispy potatoes.  The last thing we ordered was the Snickers pancake.  This was at LEAST a food wide (see picture).

Overall, the food was delicious!  The highlights of the meal for me were the Snickers pancake (of course)  This thing was SO fluffy!  It was like having more than one pancake stacked on top of another!  Also, the crispy potatoes were to die for--they had an amazing crunch.  I also really enjoyed the flavor of the french toast.  There was just a hint of banana without being overwhelming! 

 Seeing how my mouth was busy nomming on the snicker's pancake, my husband downed the bacon and eggs and said those were really good (why he chose the bacon and eggs over the deliciousness of the pancake, I will never know, but I was grateful!  More for me!

The farmhouse scrambler was just ""ok"".  It wasn't really a standout among the amazingness of the other dishes.  Maybe if I had ordered it somewhere near me where it wouldn't be in competition with other more spectacular selections, it would have fared far better.

So come for the food, and try to ignore the service.  Goodness knows they ignore you!"
5697,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing!!! Worth the 30-40 minute wait. This place is off the chain baby. Large portions of some of the best food I've had in a while.
5698,Hash House A Go Go,4,Extremely large portions and the food is really tasty!! The prices are reasonable considering the portions are so large. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was the service was VERY slow. It took 25 min after we finished to get our check... so make sure you have plenty of time on your hands. The atmosphere is fun and the wait staff were all nice. We will be back next time!
5699,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Usually always get the chicken n waffles but I decided to get the chorizo hash with eggs  based on Roy, our server, who was the best!! This plate is my new favorite now!!! It was 3:30 am and it was still fantastic!! Roy made our visit that much better. He is the best waiter there!! He works from 11pm-6am Monday, Tuesday, Saturday, Sunday. Ask for Roy and order the chorizo hash now!!!!"
5700,Hash House A Go Go,5,Excellent service delicious food but please come with an appetite the portions are huge you can actually share a plate the server warned us and we so over did it. Lol
5701,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Warning: set aside at least 2.5-3 hours if you are going to have a meal here.  
Me and a friend came here on a random friday afternoon ~12pm.  To our surprise, the whole waiting area is packed with people waiting.  Our wait was estimated to be 40 minutes so we went to play some pai gow downstairs.  We came back in 30 minutes and they already called our name.  Awesome!   
We ordered the sage chicken benedict to share, which the waiter admitted will take at least 35 minutes.  The portion was huge.  It was a good size to share between 2 people.   This dish had chicken, cheese, bacon, eggs, biscuits, potatoes and some sort of hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were scrambled instead of poached but they were scrambled perfectly.   

Pros: new location inside the Quad, huge portions, siracha available, slow but good service, cheap.

Note to self: try Sage chicken waffles next visit."
5702,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This has certainly been my one stop shop for breakfast for many reasons..The staff is always very inviting and the few times I've gone they always seem to be very friendly..It's the genuine touch not the ""let me think you're god so I'll get more money out of you"" sort of way.

The food has no doubt been amazing and maybe someday I'll come close to even finishing half of the meal..The portions have always been massive, but hey who can complain about that? The wait time has been non existent, but I remembered just to go in early and beat the crowd (it always seems to fill up right as we're paying for the check).

I have tried the snicker pancakes, blueberry white chocolate pancakes, and the truck driver combo. Each has been a marvel in itself and cooked to perfection. 

For an over the top breakfast destination look no further, but sharing is probably better if you aren't about wasting food!"
5703,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Breakfast options on the Strip are varied, but seldom will you find great food and service at a reasonable price. There are buffets that serve cold food, cafes that are over priced do to the quality and quantity and then there is the Hash House!

Finding this restaurant can be a challenge. It is located in the very rear of the Link (follow the signs for the monorail). The atmosphere is industrial.

The breakfast menu is unique and offers lunch items, as well as breakfast. Our server pointed out before we ordered that the portions are quite large. It turned out that this was an understatement! In fact my pancake order was so large that three people could share it and be satisfied!

The food was served hot and was delicious. Our server was very good. The prices are high, but given the fact that the portions could easily be shared, the value was excellent.

This is an easy recommendation."
5704,Hash House A Go Go,5,The Eggs Benedict is as advertised. Amazing and huge. Service is great. Restaurant is clean and seating was plentiful even in the morning. For sure coming back. Even got some kino in. Lol Price was about right for the amount of food you get. Definitely able to be shared.
5705,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Overrated!  Went here for brunch, told 30 minute wait, but to keep an eye on the bar as it's first come first served. After 15 minutes 2 people stood up at the bar and 2 people raced past me and took the spots. So the bar seating is a fiasco. 

Finally got a seat at bar as no table was open after 35 minutes   Already had perused the menu during the wait so ordered when was greeted. Waited 35 minutes for the hash which was good but not great. Meanwhile I was swarmed by early morning drunks ordering drinks at the bar.  

Never again."
5706,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Warning: You will get a ton of food so make sure you are sharing with someone. Listen, I've never had a pancake this size. It was big enough to feed four to five people. This was a very popular place so there was a bit of a wait but well worth it. This place is located in the Linq hotel amd casinos up the escalator which is very conveniet. Food was a bit pricey for breakfast so expect to pay $20 per person tip excluded."
5707,Hash House A Go Go,4,"AMAZING. One of the best brunches I've ever eaten.

Vegas is always crowded at all hours of the day, so we did have a wait. But waiting is worth it!

Not a huge fan of bloody Mary's but from what I saw, it's a meal within itself. It was difficult for me to choose what to get on the menu because they have so many options. I decided to go with chicken and waffles. And when I say the portions are huge, they are enormous. My chicken and waffles were enough to feed a family of 4...no joke.

The service was alright. Wouldn't say it's a 10/10 but they are very busy and each waiter has multiple tables to serve.

Overall, I highly recommend this place regardless of how long the wait is!"
5708,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I'm surprised to see all the bad reviews of this place. 
Not my experience at all! 
We stopped here for breakfast at this newer location inside Imperial Palace. 
The place is awesome. The food was awesome! 
HUGE portions and way too many choices to make an easy decision on what to order. 
I had the HUGE breakfast Quesadilla stuffed with potatoes, eggs, tomato, cheese, topped with chili cream sauce and served ON a bed of mashed potatoes!!!!!!! YUM! 
Also tried a bite of the Griddled French Toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream! YUM. 
Also the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/ spinach, bacon and eggs looked great and our friends said it tasted great too! 

The place was busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes. The restaurant is pretty large. I guess even with all the bad reviews on yelp, the place has tons of business! 
Go check it out for yourself. It's a fun place with good food. 

The throw pillows on the booths were pretty cool too."
5709,Hash House A Go Go,5,Man size portions that are easy to share with the wifey. The wait is worth it but plan on a wait. Wife and I shared the stage chicken benedict and it was phenomenal!! Friends ordered a pancake the that was larger that her head so there was plenty to share. Our server was great and was on time eith everything. Not something we see back home very often. We would highly recommend passing thru this joint.
5710,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Would rate 0 stars if I could. I came here early morning while waiting for my check in time at a hotel next door. I saw the reviews on yelp so i thought I was in for a treat. Lets just say this place is a huge disappointment. They do give you huge portions but the food is disqusting and taste like crap. After taking two bites of my chocolate chip pancakes and eggs, I sent it back. I was with some friends who tried to eat their plates but decided they too could not stand the taste of the food either. I was really disappointed because I tried to explain to the manager that the food was really gross and she was extremely rude to us. She told us it doesn't matter and that we still need to pay for all the food( that was pretty much untouched at this point). Me being a manger myself I told her that I definitely understand the position she is in and that I didn't want to make a huge deal in front of other customers but this food made we want to vomit. The service here is terrible, and the food is gross, please don't eat here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5711,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Being the billionth person to review this place, what could I say that hasn't already been said? How about praise for the terrific service? I got into Vegas late and hungry,  walked over to Hash House around midnight, and sat at the bar. The bartender/server's name was Fonda, and she treated my half-awake, bewildered self as if I were the customer she had been waiting to see all day. She made me a BLT Bloody Mary in no time flat, and it was great-- and so generous with the alcohol that it scared me a little. 

I ordered the famous sage fried chicken and bacon waffles that everyone on Yelp said were fantastic. I am here to tell you, everyone on Yelp is telling the truth. It's delicious-- like, the kind of delicious where you try to commit the flavors to memory so you can attempt to vaguely duplicate it at home. Two people can easily share this meal. Both Fonda and another (male) server were very attentive without being overbearing, and I felt very appreciative to feel so welcomed as soon as I arrived in Las Vegas. And this place is really perfect for Vegas: Mom's home cooking, but larger than life and more luxurious!

The place is cute. It was a little confusing to find at first, but it's upstairs in the Quad, right next to The Linq. If you are in the Flamingo and walk out the door that leads to the Linq, it's more or less directly across the path. You just have to go into the building and follow the escalators upstairs."
5712,Hash House A Go Go,3,"this place was pretty cool.  we were told that there might be a 45 minute wait so we went there earlier to put our names down and to gamble a little.  place is popular. 

location: pretty central- but it's located at the imperial palace hotel- it wasnt nice.

food: surprisingly good.  but i felt like i was going to have a heart attack afterwards.  i ordered something on the menu that was supposed to be the man vs food thing.  it was pretty good with biscuits and gravy~ fried sage chicken.  

Serive: BAD.  before i even got to sit down, the waiter stepped on me. i was wearing those thin flats.  yes it hurt!  then- after the meal, we wanted to split the bill with three cards (there was six of us) and he lectured us on how we should have let him know because it jams up the machines and then we're left with cards that we can't use anymore??  what?  are you kidding me?  this is the first time i've ever heard about that!!  why is it that we never had trouble with the bills like that elsewhere?  he didnt make any sense at all.   

i would have given this place 4 stars but had to take down the 2 for location and service."
5713,Hash House A Go Go,1,"IF I COULD DO LESS STARS I ABSOLUTELY WOULD!! My family went to this place for the first time on their recent visit to Vegas this past weekend (feb7-10) we came to this location on Sunday the 9th for lunch time.  We were very excited to try this place because of of the reviews. It's ridiculous that a known place like this would have such terrible service as the service we received this time from their waitress LIZ! She treated them as an inconvenience, was extremely rude, unprofessional, and showed some kind of hatred toward my family. Upon arrival we let her know it was our first time there and she didn't care. We asked for suggestions since we said we don't eat pork and all she said was "" well if you don't order right now, your food is going to take 30-35 mins to be ready"" and left. We finally ordered and apparently it was after her time limit and the food took that long to get to us. Funny how all the tables around us that she was serving, all got their food in a timely matter and she was all smiles with them but not us! And FORBID we ask for anything else other than what comes with our food, cause we got and eye roll a long wait time for even just ranch! This is ridiculous! Idk what issues she may have, but her terrible service towards us felt very personal. Because of this, we were unable to enjoy our food and ruined our whole experience of trying this place out."
5714,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I loved the Cinnamon A Go Go coffee...very sweet but still delicious. The brown sugar banana pancake was tasty! A little crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. You can see and taste the banana. Not too sweet which i loved. Also got the two eggs with bacon, potatoes, and biscuit. The biscuit was delicious and was the size of two. Love this place! Be sure to share!"
5715,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is always a go-to after a night out of dancing & drinking. Long wait, but it's worth it. I always have the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I'm a sucker for chipotle sauce and theirs is perfect with the right amount of heat to it! 

SHARE YOUR PLATE. 
It's so much food!"
5716,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The next time I hear someone ask ""why are Americans so fat?"" I will point them in the direction of Hash HouseA Go Go.

If your idea of a quality meal is aMan v.Food challenge, then this is yourspot. For me, I always prefer quality over quantity and I left Hash House feeling underwhelmed. After reading about the ridiculous wait times that are common here, my group called ahead and made a reservation which proved to be a clutch decision that I would highly recommend to anyone planning on coming here for breakfast.

I ordered the sage fried chicken benedict (as shown on Man v. Food). You could easily split this with your significant other and still have enough food left over to start a food bank.I was starving after a night of drinking my liver into submission and I still couldn't make a dent in themountain of food they put in front of me.Each component of the dish was good on its own, but the combination of flavors didn't do it for me. I felt like I was eating soul food for lunchrather than a benedict for breakfast.

From now on I'll leave Hash House to Adam Richman and allthe otherprofessional eaters out there."
5717,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Everyone else food was tasty.  Mine, not so much.  The blueberry pancakes were not fluffy at all.  It was huge.  Yes.  No doubt, but gummy when I ate it.  I should have sent it back, but I was too tired. And ready to head to the hotel room.  I had been flying all day.  Atmosphere was full of energy.  I'll just order something different the next time I go."
5718,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I know, I know, I just could't resist coupons!  Harrahs' sent me a $25 food voucher, so I decided to give this another try.  Didn't have to wait at all, so it was a plus.  We also got a really good waitress so she made the experience much better.

Knowing how big the portion is, I opted for something lighter.  I can't find it on the menu that is on the website, but it's Beef Tenderloin with  Palenta covered in Mozzarella Cheese and Roasted Tomato http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=gP8_Emk2LPdvpEmLVGSqaA.  The beef was soooo tender!  I really liked it, but I also thought the whole dish was a little bland.  

My fiance had the Kokomo which is basically a Meatloaf Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=87lsM6fEJc1VsK_o_UBofg based on the server's recommendation.  He liked it but also thought it needed more seasoning.  

While we were waiting, our server gave us a couple of honey butter bisque's which were pretty good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=Bm7i5Sbl94SpDgemGgQ6qQ.  

If you like big portion, this place is for you.  You can also go economical by sharing an entree and order another small side dish.  I'm glad I found something I enjoyed here so I could use the food voucher in the future again."
5719,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place had fast seating & excellent customer service. The staff was friendly and courteous to their customers. The food was plentiful and very delicious. The thick bacon, juicy chicken, and home made jams are fabulous. Not to forget their delectable mashed potatoes. Bring your appetite and enjoy"
5720,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had breakfast here twice. Food was tasty, large servings, fast friendly service. They had some creative combinations on the menu. Tried a couple and they were delicious. Family friendly, good food, service and value."
5721,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great place to grab breakfast inside The Linq.  Open all day.  So if your waking up at 6am or up all night...you can count on hash house being there for you.  Their portions are huge....Def share

I had 2for1 coupon from linq players club desk.  I ordered the The Tractor Driver Combo.  Huge!

Massive quantity of food."
5722,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Another place I found because of Adam Richman from MvF....
This place has made my list of regular things to do when in Vegas.
The first two times I went to the original place on Sahara Blvd about 10 min of the Strip but then I found out the Quad (FKA, Imperial Palace) had one (which is right next to where I stayed) so I had to go again..lol

You will not believe the portions at this place!  The Pancakes look like the size of a medium Pizza (or Hubcaps), Their Benedict creations are not only monstrous they are off the hook! Personally I liked the Chicken one that was on MvF better than the Pork Filet  but the Pork one could easily feed three people (I'm 250+ lbs and it fed me twice and admittedly I should have split it into thirds). The last time I went, I was with a buddy and his son who said they live down the street from Rosco's Chicken & Waffle's then said ""These are better than Rosco's"" when referring to Hash Houses Chicken & Waffle tower (They were very good, but I've never had Chicken & Waffles before)"
5723,Hash House A Go Go,2,This location is okay. it's the normal family place but I really love their home fries and pancakes. The chicken strips were very saggy and the the customer service was unwelcoming!
5724,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Food was amazing and served in massive proportions, however the manager was rude to customers and had a terrible attitude. She also lectured her staff in the dinning area right next to our table for something that happened between two of her employees. Definitely ruined the experience. Took awhile for our waitress to take our order as well."
5725,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Hash House A Go Go, oh how I was so excited to try you and see what else you had to offer after seeing so many pictures of your chicken and waffles all over Instagram throughout the years. We touched down in Vegas at 11pm, went to our hotel to drop off our stuff and then immediately booked it to Hash House A Go Go to get our grub on. Our bodies were ready.

Unfortunately, the late night selection was pretty disappointing. Fellow vegetarians/pescetarians beware, there are not many options for us on the late night menu. I asked our server if they could accommodate me and let me order off of the other menus but he said no. 

Alright, understandable. I opted for the avocado bacon scramble minus the bacon. It came with potatoes and one of their huge biscuits. Meh, I thought it was just so-so. The cheese to egg ratio seemed really off as if I had the same amount of cheese to eggs. Would you like some eggs with your cheese?

If you're into super big portions and want a meal that serves as breakfast, lunch AND dinner all-in-one, then this is the place for you! All of my guy friends really enjoyed their meals, however. And I can totally see how this place can be amazing after a heavily intoxicated night, it just wasn't meant to be for me this time. :("
5726,Hash House A Go Go,5,"You can't go wrong with this place. Open 24 hours, Breakfast served all day, Huge Portions, etc. Try the Chicken and Waffles and the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. So very good. Crispy Fried Chicken and the sauce is a perfect match. And get yourself a Huge Bloody Mary as well.

The service was very friendly, and great with giving recommendations. 

Expect long lines when coming in for lunch or dinner, but it's very worth it."
5727,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Overrated to be honest. I ordered the meatloaf hash, the potatoes didn't have much flavor or crisp to them. I ordered hash thinking thats what they specialize in. 
Came with a biscuit and that was delicious. The portions are HUGE, but I've had better breakfast. The wait was ridiculously long 45-1 hour for table for 2. 
The boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles, really large portion, it was good but a mess on a plate, but also have had better. 
The ""spicy"" bloody wasn't spicy and did not enjoy it at all. Go downstairs to Off the strip restaurant/bar for drinks.  
Wouldn't dine here again just do to the damn long wait."
5728,Hash House A Go Go,5,Sehr lecker aber massig viel! Der Chicken Benedict dort ist legendÃ¤r. Wenn Kaffee dann bitte Latte bestellen. Aller sehr gut und das SÃ¤ttigungsgefÃ¼hl hÃ¤lt bis zum Abend. :-)
5729,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We came here for one reason - chicken and waffles.  I left having eaten just one thing - chicken and waffles.  Well, half of it anyways.

True to diner fashion, portions were gigantic.  The menu, however, was only two pages.  If you find yourself looking for the other 15 pages...you are most likely looking for a Jersey diner.  This is not a Jersey diner.

We came in for a ""late dinner"", sometime just after 10pm.  I say ""late"" because time isn't really static in Vegas.  Sure, there were other people in there with us...but you could differentiate pretty easily between those that were just starting their night, just ending it, had just woken up, and those who obviously had no idea what time it was.

Chicken and waffles can be had for any meal of the day.  I chose it here for two reasons - the other reviews of the chicken and waffles, and the fact i've never had it before.  Yes, gasp, I know.

Well, this was the place to have it.  We split it and barely finished it.  The waffles were huge, and the chicken was all kinds of crispy.  Do you want extra syrup?  Yeah, you do.

We paired our split dinner with two specialty drinks, which absolutely hit the spot.  We were in and out in 25 minutes for less than $40.

It's hard for me to recommend anything else on the menu...we only ate that one thing and the people around us were also eating it.  I saw some burgers and eggs on the menu, but honestly, you can get that anywhere. 

If you eat chicken, and you eat waffles, merge those delicious flavors here at any time of the day."
5730,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I had to deduct another star this visit for the entirely underwhelming service. The food came through yet once again, but from the moment we had human interaction with this place, it was just unfortunate. The hostesses seemed to have an attitude and took forever to arrange our table in a completely empty restaurant and our server took forever and just seemed to be going with the motions. Not that I need to be entertained, but be friendly, you're a server. If all we had to do was eat amazing food, this place would get five stars."
5731,Hash House A Go Go,2,"THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!! all the portions are crazy but everything is amazing. I had the Komomo, which is a meatloaf sandwhich, and it was amazing! and I can't stand meatloaf. BUT the service is HORRIBLE!!! the host is really slow but the server is even slower!! I understand it vegas and its busy but we went when it wasn't busy and she still didn't have a clue how to do her job. She had like 3 tables and messed up everything. The prices are ok and the FOOD gets an A++ but the service gets a ZERO."
5732,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I'm probably in the minority here, but this place just didn't live up to the hype.

Went here for Christmas brunch with the whole family. We ordered a bunch of stuff but I'll review their 2 most famous that I tasted: Chicken and Waffles and their Eggs Benedict, and my nephew also ordered the Hamburger that I took a bite.

On presentation and portion size alone, HHAGG gets a 5+ stars.  However, on taste it's just a 2 star. Sorry, maybe it's a case of expectations. When you have such great presentation, I expect the taste to explode in my mouth. It was more of a whimper. 

It's not bad, but it's not great and would have gotten a 3 star but I guess the hype actually hurts the place. And despite the generous portions, I didn't want more. Give me less, charge me less, and I probably would have given it a 3 star."
5733,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Yuck.

If you enjoy dry flavorless biscuits, powdery potatoes, bland overcooked chicken, and overspiced gravy (because the chef is trying to hide bad food under cheap gravy), then this is the place for you.

I prefer to go somewhere else.  Honestly I thought the scrambled eggs were tasty, but then again, I could get those from McDonalds for 1/4 the price.

Hash House is just bad."
5734,Hash House A Go Go,1,Service is horrible.  We waited over 20 minutes for our server to acknowledge us.  Now we are at 50 minutes and still no food.  I really hope the food is worth the wait because the service isn't.  Hope this place isn't just hype.  Much longer and we will walk.
5735,Hash House A Go Go,5,Just a great experience all around.  I had the sage chicken and waffles.  It was divine.
5736,Hash House A Go Go,3,enjoyed it but i can go without my plate looking like jumanji...
5737,Hash House A Go Go,4,Hash house a go go is a gem. I have loved everything I have eaten from this place. More locations in Vegas then anywhere else but there is one in San Diego as well. Food is good and service is okay. Will continue to keep visiting .
5738,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Was excited to finally try this place out and I'm pretty glad we did it was definitely worth the visit. When we got there they said it would be a half hour wait it was more like 15 minutes. The place kind of reminded of a old diner very busy and the staff was friendly.We ordered the two most popular items on the menu which where of course the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. The serving size for both these plates is huge so they are perfect for sharing and there is going to be leftovers. 

The sage fried chicken Benedict was amazing I'm not sure why some of the reviews that I've read said is was bland. To me the chicken was seasoned perfectly and the mashed potatoes where a nice touch and had a little bit of spicy flavored added to the dish. It also had had eggs and bacon in the dish. It was really awesome and it would be hard for me not to order anything but this I really thought this was a great meal.

The sage chicken and waffles was also a huge portion chicken was also seasoned wonderfully and the waffles had bacon in them. Maybe could of used more syrup but overall it was great I liked my Benedict over the chicken and waffles. They also had strong coffee which is a plus in my book.

The only thing I can say negative about this place is the service that we got from our waiter was really bad. It took forever to get refills on coffee and water. Also wanted cream and sugar for the coffee no problem see you in 15min and we had a set of dirty silverware when we sat down."
5739,Hash House A Go Go,3,This place had really good reviews so we decided to try it the day we were leaving Vegas. Food was mediocre but portions were huge. My boyfriend got the apple pancake which was enormous but very basic in taste. I got the southwest hash which also was just OK. Service was very quick. Probably wouldn't go back next time I'm in Vegas because I think there are better options for breakfast.
5740,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Hash House A Go Go is coming to Chicago! Now I can relive the hungover moment that I had in Vegas lol.

I had a list of restaurants that I wanted to go to on my recent trip to Vegas. Hash house is the only place I made it to on that list. 

We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday. Don't be afraid of all the people waiting. We were seated within 10 minutes. The hostess was super nice. The rest of our party wasn't there yet, but she still sat us down right away. I was tired of eating eggs so I got the waffle. My friend had some sort of skillet. 

My waffle was huge and tasty. It was a little tough to eat though. It wasn't one of those waffles that's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was just soft all around. I ordered a side of strawberries with whipped cream. It cost me $6 for 5 strawberries!! I wish the waitress would have told me that. My friend's skillet wasn't like your regular skillet where they put the eggs on top of the potatoes and then melt the cheese. The eggs and potatoes were separate. 

I'll give this place another try when they open in Chicago, but when I go to Vegas I'll pass."
5741,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Do it! Have any of the scrambles & get it with the garlic mashed potatoes. Service was excellent, & their coffee is amazing."
5742,Hash House A Go Go,3,"This is the second time I visit this place and the quality of food was not the same as the first time. However, the plate presentation is still amazing!"
5743,Hash House A Go Go,4,Great service. Cool atmosphere. Trying the Sage chicken as featured on Man vs. food. Highly recommended by the staff.
5744,Hash House A Go Go,5,I come here at least twice every time I visit Vegas. Fried chicken Benedict and the mimosa are the best! Heading there right now!
5745,Hash House A Go Go,5,"The manager Fonda!!! Ah - May - Zing !!! She was able to turn what started off as a bad experience into a GREAT experience. Working in the Hospitality industry on the Vegas strip i completely understand service isnt always as quick and easy as we would like it to be, and thats ok. However, that being said ive always come across managers who will ask an upset guest ""what can i do to make the situation better?"" , ""would you like me to take money off the bill?"" Fonda did the exact opposite , she approached the situation ready to listen and she was not quick to throw a ""free meal"" in our face which most managers will do to get the guest away quickly. She stopped what she was doing and put our orders in herself AND served us. She was even nice enough to bring our drinks which our ORIGINAL waiter did not do , we didnt even meet him/her. Fonda literally said to us ""Im going to show you what a real Hash House Experience is like"" that statement alone was enough to win me over after i was ready to find a new location to dine at. Yes , a lot of the workers need to brush up on their customer service, but Fondas gesture made all of them irrelevant. THANK YOU SO MUCH FONDA."
5746,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First off go with the expectation that you will wait an hour to be seated...but the wait is worth it if you want big portions of delicious breakfast food that is prepared to perfection and priced at a very fair value ! I have been many times and I've never been disappointed with any of my meals and I try something new each time.  The Hash House takes breakfast to the next level with flavor combos that you wouldn't expect, but after you experience them you wonder why no one has done it before."
5747,Hash House A Go Go,3,"I dunno, it's a flashy set up, but the food was only so - so. That being said, the bartender was AMAZING. He was drastically overworked and understaffed and the drink menu gives ridiculously complicated options for a single person to have to cover, especially considering it's about a 200 person or larger joint. If you are looking for over indulgence (and really, this is Vegas...) than you really should come here. the plating of the chicken and waffles is nearly obscene! The S'mores coffee, wow... and do yourself a favor and add a shot of Bailey's.

(the wait WILL BE LONG... my secret is grabbing a spot at the bar)"
5748,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I cannot even give 1 star. So disappointed in the experience we just had at Hash House.  It makes me not want to return ever.  Which is hard for me to say because I love Hash House. 

So we are here this weekend celebrating my fiancÃ© 's 30th Birthday. The 1 place he was excited to go to and wanted to eat at was Hash House. What a poor choice!!!

Yes we understand it is Vegas and it will be busy but we ordered sandwiches and a biscuit, you guys are professionals, this should not be too difficult.  San Diego Hash House would never run this way.  

So once seated it took over 50 minutes to get our food, we watched at counted at least  10+ tables seated after us receive their food before us.  That  is insulting and extremely unprofessional. 

At minute 35 our server notices that we still do not have our food.  So he goes back to check only to return empty handed.  He does however makes mention our food is on the way out.  10 min later we still have no food but are reassured it's on the way out. The 3rd time he comes to the table he tells us that our prime rib sandwich is in the window but the manager will not let it leave the line.  He cannot tell us why our this is or why our order is taking so long.  He apologizes and tells us he put our food in at 2:09, it is now close to 2:55.  4th time to the table is tells us the manager is personally bringing our food out and that he feels someone grabbed our food by mistake. 5th time he returns with the manager ( wearing a red shirt today and when asked did not give his name), with our food.  We tell him how disappointed we were and that we were there trying to have a nice birthday lunch.  By now my finances food has been sitting in the window alone for at least 10 minutes, bread soggy and meat cold.  He seemed uninterested in our issue and said he would stand there to make sure our food was ok.  The prime rib was heat lamp well done but cold and the bread was soggy on the bottom and hard on the top.  So needless to say not ok.  The most disappointing aspect of this whole experience is the lack of caring.  Hopefully this is not a everyday occurrence at the Hash House and no one experiences what we did. 

 

-Presentation was horrible- not what I know of Hash House. 
-Taste was horrible- food sat too long and was not fresh as we know of the HashHouse
-Staff- our server was great and the manager did not seem to care.

5749,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Minus one star for the wait, which is ALWAYS at least an hour if you come during mealtimes...if you come around 10 am before all the haggard, drunk people wake up, you should be good! 

The portions are freaking RIDICULOUS at first sight, but actually quite manageable if you sift through all the ""fixins"". They just go for vertical height which makes the dish look super huge, but its not that bad! Great hangover food, but nothing gourmet. All in all, for the price you pay and the fact that it's on the strip makes it a decently priced option for a meal. 

The chicken and waffles are pretty good, but my favorite is the corned beef hash! Not of the mushy pancake-looking variety, but the corned beef is actually in strips and comes with nicely seasoned potatoes and fruit on the side inside a cast iron skillet. I found the portion size to be manageable but not skimpy. I also always order a peach ice tea, but that's just me. Everything else on the menu is decently tasty - the skillets, omelets, and the 1-lb burger...

Just remember to come with loose pants and patience for the line! And if you really need to, bring the flask for irish coffee in the morning!"
5750,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Amazing food with huge portions.  
No need to order more than one dish cuz it's huge amounts and definitely enough food"
5751,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Great service; large servings but great tasting food! Highly highly recommended and best of all, very affordable."
5752,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Bananas foster w caramelized bananas in their peel. Thick wheat French toast w toasted pecans.
Corned beef strips with Swiss cheese, chopped bell peppers, and eggs, biscuit and country potatoes.
The wait was long once we got seated but the food was really good. Portions are large, fried chicken n waffles are huge btw so order those if you're super hungry."
5753,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I'd been to the Hash House downtown, but not this particular location in the LINQ.  This time around I had breakfast - specifically the pancake (yes, it was one, singular pancake.  See picture below.).  The waiter we had was attentive and checked on us often.  Also, the fresh-squeezed juice was very delicious!"
5754,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here for a second time and customer service was on point just like I remember! 

If you come in the morning be prepared to wait. But come at night, especially for dinner, and your cherry. The service is friendly and quick and I barely waited for 10 minutes before my order came out.

Keep in mind that the prices and definitely worth the portions that they serve and it is meant to share (unless you are starving). Definitely reccomended the fried chicken eggs Benedict; you get a bed of mashed potatoes, two large biscuits, large cuts of crispy boneless fried chicken, topped with an egg and layered with their delicious Benedict sauce.

Other than that I also reccomended the corned beef hash or French toast.

If you are staying at the Linq or in the area then this is a must for the Vegas foodie bucket list."
5755,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If I could eat here every day I would! Service is great, food is great, atmosphere is great! I'm 6'1 and the pancake was wayyy bigger than my hand. Very good as well! I also got the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes. You HAVE to try it!"
5756,Hash House A Go Go,4,"We ate here with family and the wait was pretty long, and our food took forever to come to our table.  However, the portions were large, and the food was delicious.  My hubby ordered a huge burger with all the fixings and mash potatoes on the side.  I had the sage fried chicken salad with a biscuit, and I could only finish half it because it was so much food."
5757,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Holy moly! Can we say HUGE portions????!!! This was yummy, but I feel like the focus was more on novelty than flavor. So much was on my plate that I felt like certain things lost flavor. 

I got the eggs benedict with sage fried chicken, griddled mozzarella, fresh spinach with eggs and bacon on a buttermilk biscuit with hollandaise. It was good, but the I couldn't fully taste the fried chicken with everything else going on.  My friend got the meatloaf. This was definitely tastier.
Overall, a great experience, and I definitely recommend it if you're hungry!"
5758,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Because my flight delayed and landed extremely late and I didn't want fast food and this was on the way, we decided to go here because it was OPEN 24/7..... The portion was humungous but the quality as just ewww. Smh a few bites into the food I pushed it forward and stopped eating. The guy was great but was a bit offended when I said I was done with it and bearly touched it. He took my plate and brought my check but clearly didn't offer a box to go or anything. Oh well, not coming back..... FYI don't ever let the amount and height of food fool you ever! It's quality over quantity."
5759,Hash House A Go Go,5,AMAZING!! We went for breakfast to the IP location. We were sat immediately (it was 8am). I ordered the Hash House Quesadilla and my husband ordered the Chorizo Hash. Mine was falling over the sides of the plate large and his was served in a cast iron skillet filled to each side. The meal was perfect!! Service was great. Prices are reasonable. Portions are HUGE!  Will definitely return.
5760,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This is my new favorite breakfast place. Too bad it's all the way in Vegas...

I had the chocolate chip pancakes with scrambled eggs.  I didn't know that they pancakes would be so big, so when I ordered it, I asked how many it came with (to make sure it was enough for me). The waiter said an order came with 1 pancake, and I kind of made a face. He laughed and said they were really big.  That was an understatement!  The pancakes are HUGE!!!  They're probably over a foot in diameter.  The chef is not stingy on the chocolate chips either. It was the best pancake I've ever had.  My boyfriend got the banana pancake, that was AMAZING too.  
I will definitely be going back every time I make a visit to Vegas!"
5761,Hash House A Go Go,2,"I had never been to HH and I think I've figured out why. If I wanted that much food I would go to one of the brunch buffets and get unlimited mimosas. 

The portions are HUGE. Like don't expect a calorie intake less than 5,500 calories. Even the drinks are huge. HH is known for its bloody marys, minimum size is 20 oz. 

While I didn't love my scrambled eggs with sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and basil with mashed potatoes and a biscuit, others were raving about their biscuits and gravy and friend chicken. Other disappointments are the soggy toast, not crispy potatoes (even though they are famous for the crispy potatoes), over medium eggs being really runny. The homemade peach jam was delicious. Needless to say no one cleaned their plate. The Bloody Maria was typically 20 oz., very spicy, had a green bean, two olives, and a pickle. Good but not great. 

Service was very slow on bringing drinks, the food, refills, anything. We watched as she had to make six stops after taking our request and actually doing it. 

After almost an hour wait, then slow service and not great food, I'd say not again. Neat that Man vs. Food gave the place great reviews, probably more for the quantity. And even with the quantity, you are still paying for it (on average $20-$30 for breakfast per person)."
5762,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is always super crowded! They don't take reservations on the weekend and u have to call 24 hours in advance to make one during the week. A bunch of celebrities have been there and it's typically a 45 minute a wait kind of place.... Buuttt the food is worth it! Huge portions, really eclectic menu with fresh farmed fruits/veggies and meats. The service is slow and the staff at the hostess stand are not friendly sadly, maybe due to being Overwhlemed but that's def the downfall!!!!! Must try when in Vegas and had too many drinks the night before"
5763,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Arrived around 9 a.m. on Friday morning (day after Thanksgiving)---no wait, sat us down right away.  I noticed that some people complained about the wait time & service--this might depend on what time you show up.

We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict (favorite of man vs. food).  This was about $15 something.  Since I heard the portions were huge, my husband & I decided to share this plate.  Both of us left stuffed. (FYI: my mom said she went here a while back & they didn't let her get an extra plate to share food, but we had no problem).  It's hard to describe the flavor of this delicious bad boy, because it was so good!  The blend of flavors was just awesome.  It has: chipotle cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, griddled mozzarella, fried chicken, bacon, market tomato, spinach, biscuit on top of griddled potatoes.  I would go back again & order the same dish---never tasted anything so good!

We also ordered a pancake from the ""children's menu."" for my 2 year old.  That thing was HUGE....of course, she only ate like 4-5 bites and that was it.  I think about 3-4 kids could share this.  It was around $3 and pretty tasty---syrup was warm and really good.

The waiter brought out our bill kind of early: ""I know how it is with a child, so I'm just leaving this here for when ever you're ready.""  We didn't mind, because our daughter was getting fussy, but I can see how others might take this the wrong way.

*The large orange juice was $6, which I thought was expensive.

I'll definitely come here again, but only if I share a plate.  There were many people taking left overs home and I did see everyone ordering their own plate (not sure if this is a rule, if people just eat a lot, or people want left overs to take home).  I'll share a plate next time or will make sure my hotel has a fridge/microwave."
5764,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Make sure you bring a huge appetite! The food here is amazing, the portions are very generous and the service is fast!  The staff are always friendly and honest...if they tell you the portion is really large BELIEVE THEM!!! LOL"
5765,Hash House A Go Go,5,"HUUUGE portions. I finally got a chance to try out Hash House and was very impressed. Located on the second floor of Imperial Palace which is a random spot to be, HH is place you should defintely check out if you want some good food and want to avoid buffets. I always hear there are long waits to get into this place so when I got there and got seated right away I was very surprised. After watching Man V Food I really wanted to try the chicken eggs benedict. It was so much food I barely even finished half of it. The whole meal was full of flavor. The bed of mash was tasty, chicken was moist, the cheese topping was delicious, and the best part of it all was the chipotle sauce that is covered on everything. Had a kick to it which I enjoyed very much. Service here is really good, our waiter gave good recommendations and came by to check up on us throughout the meal. Def stop by this spot when you are in Vegas, you won't be dissappointed."
5766,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place was jam packed when we arrived, said seating would take 20 minutes, I think we waited at least an hour to be seated, but it was so worth the wait!   The food was delicious.  My husband and I were so full and the flavor was just astronomical!!  This food is bursting with flavor.  The husband ordered banana cinnamon pancakes and he can't stop talking about it & and it was GINORMOUS!  I had a scramble with potatoes and biscuit, so, so yummy!   It did take a while and our server was eh, but like I said the place was packed and he did his best.  We just had to waive him down a few times to ask for more coffee, but other than that he was as attentive as he could be humanly possible."
5767,Hash House A Go Go,5,Went to Hash House about a week ago on our annual Vegas trip! The food and service were awesome! There was a group of 5 of us and we all were more than pleased with our experience. Our waiter Alan answered every question we had in detail and gave really sound advice. He told us about the Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict it sounded great my buddy had that and raved about it. I really wanted to try it but he said it had a chipotle cream sauce all over it but the sauce had a kick to it . I can't handle spicey food at all so but really wanted to try the fried chicken. Not being a waffle person I was bumbed I might not have an option for me. Alan pointed out the sage chicken and eggs dish when I told him I didnt want the other 2 dishes he said its similar to the Benedict I wanted but no chipotle cream. The dish was exactly what I was looking for! I also added a side order of sausage gravy that was delicious for my home made biscuit. I also had a house bloody Mary with screw driver with kettle one you could tell the juice was fresh squeezed. The meal and experience was fantastic and me and my buddies are making it a must stop on our yearly trip. Ask for Alan he knows what he's doing and will find a way to get you what your looking for!
5768,Hash House A Go Go,2,"It has been some time since I was so disappointed with a brunch experience! We had gotten a number of recommendations for Hash House from friends that we finally decided even though it was over an hour wait for a table, we'd hang out. After much anticipation, it was our turn! Already off to a bad start as we were seated in the back corner of the restaurant with lots of server traffic, bringing dirty dishes back, we kept an open mind because it would've been even longer until we got another table.

The service was super slow & at one point non-existent but we got our orders in. I went with the Brown Sugar Banana Flapjack & my husband went with the House Hash with mushrooms, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach. As seen in the photos, the portion sizes were massive. The good news kind of stops there. The Flapjack was really dry even though it looked okay. The banana part of it was really the only part I liked; the flapjack itself wasn't thrilling and the House Hash was super dry. My husband was so hungry he ate most of it and commented that the biscuit was good, but aside from that it left a lot to be desired.

Just because of how much others have raved about this place, I'm willing to come back in the future and give it another chance. I'm thinking it would be good to plan ahead and enjoy some cocktails at the bar beforehand next time (I heard comments from others that their Bloody Mary is good). For now though, 2-star rating."
5769,Hash House A Go Go,4,The food is awesome! All five of my friends and I ordered the sage chicken and when the food hit our table there was that magical moment of silence. When you know the food is good because nobody wants to talk to each other cuz the food is just too good. Bad part though was that it toOK FOREVER like a legit 45-hour. But worth it.
5770,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Really nice staff! I had a really great egg and hash brown dish. The biscuit with it was huge! Also, the actor who plays Neville Longbottom was sitting at the next table over. So that's pretty cool."
5771,Hash House A Go Go,2,"We went here for breakfast on our last morning in Vegas because our hotel does not have a coffee shop.  We waited 15 minutes for a table.  Then, the waitress came to our table, and told us (with a straight face) that everything was made from scratch, so it would take 30 to 45 minutes to receive our food after we ordered it.  This type of talk is generally a sign that the kitchen is poorly run, and unless you are baking biscuits to order, or killing a chicken for my dinner, it should not take that long to fry some eggs or make a short order breakfast.

We got up and left."
5772,Hash House A Go Go,4,I dropped into this place a few nights on my way back to my room as the service and food is excellent. Lots of choices on the menu with easy selections for vegetarians as my server was very happy to accommodate.
5773,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Wow! A surprisingly good restaurant inside imperial palace of all places! Super busy and crowded with crazy wait times, but the rating is all for the food. The sage fried chicken benedict was DA BOMB! Ok i don't talk like that but seriously..wow. The ridiculously huge portions were well worth the $$ I paid for my food. I must emphasize that sharing your plate is highly recommended! Hubby ordered the chicken and waffles, but ended up eating most of mine cause he liked it WAY better. Cleaned my plate and we were both satisfied. And he barely touched his chixnwaffles. Lesson of the day: SHARE!"
5774,Hash House A Go Go,4,Came to Hash House A Go Go after an extreme night of debauchery and did have to wait about 45 minutes before being seated on a Saturday morning. Keeping in mind there was a ridiculous amount of people ahead of us I was actually quite impressed at being seated so soon. I ordered the tangerine juice in hopes of curing my hang over but unfortunately did not find it very tasteful or to my nor my friends liking. I did however have the friend chicken eggs Benedict and found it to be impressive in size and rather delicious. I would in fact come back to this location.
5775,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I have been to all the HHGGs in town, and finally got to try the IP location when my folks were in town for the weekend.

We went on a Saturday around noon, so I definitely knew there would be a wait. They quoted us 45 minutes, but it ended up being only about 25, which isn't bad. If you're at any decent breakfast place on the strip on a weekend, you'll have to wait. 

I typically enjoy going to the older properties to check them out and get a bargain drink, but with all the construction going on right now, the IP is hell to get in and out, plus the smokiness level is pretty high down in the casino. Luckily, HHGG has its own mezzanine-kind of level, which is all smoke-free.

Since I'm with child over here, I didn't order a drink, but I did sample the Orange Crush (kinda like a mimosa with vodka and a salt rim) and the bloody mary (super spicy and very strong) - I thought they were both great! The bloody mary, especially, reminded me of something I'm definitely looking forward to after the baby is born in May!

On to the food. I almost always get something with fried chicken at HHGG, so this time I went for the fried chicken benedict. The chicken was excellent, as always - delicious sage breading, not too heavy, and no bones! They came on top of spinach, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a biscuit, with a kind of creamy chili sauce all over. Oh, and underneath, was a huge block of mashed potatoes, probably the equivalent of 2 large potatoes! My one complaint about the dish was that the biscuits were kinda dry and bland. The others in my party got the vanilla waffle, blue cheese burger, and rueben sandwich (which is called the pub crawl). I seriously loved the waffle and the pub crawl. The corned beef and sauerkraut were so delicious and flavorful, they totally complimented the rye bread, and I usually hate rye bread. I thought the burger was good, but nothing too exciting.

Yes, there is too much food! We were all super hungry (and the waffle was only like a half meal, since it comes by itself), and together we ate about 3/4 of everything. No problem - I love leftovers!

Prices run from $8 for the waffle to $16 for the eggs benedict, which is all totally reasonable. The drinks are a little high at $14/ea for the specialty drinks, but that's definitely in line with typical strip prices.

Only drawback was the service. While friendly, our server seemed super rushed, and the kitchen took a while to get our food out."
5776,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Came Here On 6/18/2018 For Breakfast. Hash House Has Been Around Forever I Used To Go To The One In Planet Hollywood, Most Of Them Are 24hrs. They Serve Huge Portions Of Food And Everything Is Fresh, We Had Been Wanting To Try The Chicken And Waffles. My Friend And I Decided To Share A Plate Because It Was Huge We Also Ordered A Side Of Eggs And Cheese And Some Potatoes, And Let Me Tell You It Was Amazing And Worth The Money, Keep In Mind The Portions Are Large And I Believe The Plate Was $20 Not Including The Eggs Or Potatoes We Ordered, I Will Keep Coming Back The Food Is Amazing And Service Is Always Great!"
5777,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is awesome! !! The size is ridiculously big for its price. First time to Vegas,  this is the only wow experience food restaurant.  Though the line is long but we got lucky to get seats very quick


I ordered a pork chop which is bigger than my face!!. For its price, it come in very very huge size. The picture provided did nor serve justice. I would suggest if you're not big greasy eater, order something to share! Save stomach for something else if possible."
5778,Hash House A Go Go,4,"No complaints.... the lady next to me was a little crazy but I can't blame them for that. Went twice this trip. First time I got the chicken salad with the sage fried chicken  my favorite. Was going back for chicken and red velvet waffles but was persuaded into the fried green tomato and chicken salad stack. Please don't be fooled, this was absolutely delicious. From the goat cheese to the basaltic drizzle. The flavors we perfect together. My only complaint was that I don't like dark meat and there was a mixture of meat in there. Just my personal preference. So glad I listened to the bar tenders and gave something new a try! Winning."
5779,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is pretty cool.. 

I wouldn't really say anything special but nothing to put down.. it's always a solid option."
5780,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Outside of a long wait time for our food to come, this place was amazing. Excellent food, HUGE portions - all delicious!! Would go again in A heartbeat!"
5781,Hash House A Go Go,4,"I had the eggs, sausage, biscuits, and crispy potatoes. Price was a bit on the high side, but not out of the ordinary for vegas . Egss were good, sausage was pretty bland. Biscuit was large but lacked flavor. Service was great and they were really busy."
5782,Hash House A Go Go,4,"My husband and son love breakfast, so we had to try this place. (and because it was on man vs. food!)  Talk about HUGE PORTIONS! Totally worth it!  Great place to go after a long night out in Vegas.  

FOOD ORDERED:
-HH signature Mimosa - just right for Vegas!

-2 Tractor Driver Combo's (includes 2 farm eggs, bacon, sausage, or potatoes with 1 hash house signature flapjack).

I got the Brown Sugar Banana Flap Jacks with my combo - fluffy & wholesome, and was the size of an XL plate.

Hubby got the Snickers Flap Jack - ehhh, needed more snickers...

Kids Bacon Waffle (had large strips of bacon baked into a LARGE waffle) - sweet and salty, what a perfect balance...

ATMOSPHERE: 
In the Imperial Palace, 2nd floor. It has its own escalators. Got a little lost. Needs more signs in Casino. Clean, Metal, garage like, Reminds me of an upscale burger joint. 

SERVICE:
25 minute wait. Went there at 1100 am. Good at first, then slow at the end to bring the check. But, overall good.

TIP:
You can use restaurant.com coupons here!"
5783,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The portions were very huge. The place was definitely overhyped. Very regular bland taste. If you want a huge filling breakfast, this is a place for you. It was pricey. For 4 people we spent $80 with tip. I definitely don't think the quality was there."
5784,Hash House A Go Go,4,"This place is always great. The portions are absurd. I ordered the friend chicken Benedict, pretty flavorful but a lot of food for one person. It's a must try for everyone!"
5785,Hash House A Go Go,4,"While waiting for a table, I was looking at the promotional food pictures of their menu. I saw the chicken and waffles.  I thought to myself, ""self, there's no way the chicken and waffles is that big, it must be a fake promo picture.""

I was wrong.

To say it came out of the kitchen on a ""plate"" would be misguiding.  This dish came out on a borderline serving platter.

Two huge pieces of fried chicken, stabbed into place by a knife into a set of three gigantic Belgian waffles.

""But... But... No bacon"", you stutter frantically.  Yes bacon, it's literally cooked into the waffles.

Their supplier must have been having a fire-sale on rosemary, because every dish I saw escape that kitchen was speared with a gigantic sprig of it.

Besides the gigantic portions, the food itself was exceptionally tasty.  The chicken had crispy skin, the waffles were soft on the inside but crunchy enough on the outside so that the syrup didn't reduce them to mush.  The various sauce drizzles and garnish elements added some extra flavor.

(The two cherry tomatoes are added to turn this delicious pile of salt and fat into a healthy choice.)

The shtick here is the plate presentation.  With the large portion sizes, sauce drizzles, rosemary sprigs, and knives straight through your food, everything that comes out of the kitchen looks fun to eat.  The food itself tastes great, but it's the over-the-top presentation that sets this place apart."
5786,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Excellent. Huge portions. Great service.  Delicious food.  Reasonably priced. 
Only down side is it gets super busy."
5787,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I just want to say I've always loved hash house and have always had a great experience, but today we had the absolute worst service. Took us a good 20 min to get waters and then took us about an hour to get our food. The server was not attentive and he never checked on us to see how we were doing. Don't think I will waste my time going back here."
5788,Hash House A Go Go,5,"As I'm in a food coma I'll write a review...

Be sure to share the portions, the size is HUGE! I shared the Fried chicken Benedict and both of us still couldn't finish it! It's stacked with mashed potatoes, biscuits, egg, bacon, cheese, and fruit on the side topped with sage! The layers of flavors and textures was mouthwatering. The food display was really pleasant to, good for those Instagram pics!  I'm usually not a brunch type of person but this place is bomb.com 

The price is really good too, only $19ish plus tax for 2 for this plate! Really worth! 

It was a 1hr ish wait but we can back early about 40 min and they seated us, so really good customer service on their part! 

Definitely a must come if you visit Vegas! Try to try a different dish to share each time! They also have awesome couches with pillows so perfect for a nice nap afterwards!  perfect for napping to wait for your partner to finish their food~"
5789,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Over Rated. I was very disappointed, especially since Adam of Man Vs. Food recommended this joint haha. Anyway- the server we had was so rude and un-helpful. She acted like she didn't want to be there and it was clearly too early in the morning for her to be awake and working. She never brought out our waters until after the food was served. While the portions are certainly HUGE, the taste was just blah. I've had way better pancakes, eggs, and bacon at many other restaurants before. I honestly would've rather ate at IHOP or Denny's than this place."
5790,Hash House A Go Go,5,"This place is worth the long wait. Delicious every time and the food is presented beautifully. The breakfast potatoes are fried well done, the eggs when ordered basted are perfect, and the menu has interesting items even for vegetarians. Sitting at the bar is entertaining because you can watch them make drinks like the s'more mocha, which I will definitely save room for next time."
5791,Hash House A Go Go,3,Shared the sage chicken and waffles with a friend. It was just ok I guess. Our waiter gave me a side of gravy so I can dip my chicken in it. That was a plus.
5792,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Last night we had terrible service. I asked for my Tenderloin to have lots of mustard instead of the listed ketchuo. Waiter said I would get ""alot of mustard"". It came out with ketchup and i had to send it back. Waiter was terrible never sticking around long enough for is to answer our responses when he would ask us a question. Tonight we went in and asked if we could still could get food as it was 11pm. The hostess said no problem. We never saw a server after ten minutes. The table next to is were in the same situation. They got up to go find someone and we left. HH we had a great experience down at Freemont street a few years ago bit this location needs alot of work! No stars from me at this time if possible."
5793,Hash House A Go Go,5,"First time to Vegas, first restaurant in Vegas, have to say the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had and it's not even close. We decided on the sage fried chicken on waffles and it did not disappoint! Presentation was top notch, flavor was even better, a must eat if in town!"
5794,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Came here with my bf for breakfast on our anni before leaving vegas. This was my second time trying hash house and my bf's first time trying it. The first time I had hash house I ordered the chicken and waffles and a side of biscuits and gravy. Wasn't too crazy about the chicken and waffles, but the biscuits and gravy were great! This time me and my bf tried the man v. food special- Andy's sage fried chicken benedict with a side of biscuits and gravy. I don't usually like benedicts, but this was a different kind of benedict. i love it!!! it was so delicious. the combination of everything in it- the eggs, chicken, potatoes, biscuit, bacon.. along with the gravy.. oh mannn, sooo delicious. I will definitely stick to ordering that next time I come!"
5795,Hash House A Go Go,5,What a nice surprise.  We were up early and ran into this place walking through the Quad.  Only expected basic diner food since we have never head of this place.  Was I wrong.   This place was incredible.  Best breakfast I've ever had in Vegas.  Highly recommended.  Everything we had was great and every plate coming out of the kitchen looked delicious.
5796,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Great breakfast and large portions. The biscuits are amazing and the homemade jelly!! They need better coffee, but that's my only complaint."
5797,Hash House A Go Go,4,"It took hash house to get me to set foot inside the IP.  Wait was short for a Friday morning.  Service was great.  I was a little on the hungover side so I kept it simple.  Bacon, eggs, potatoes.  Bacon was thick and delish.  Hubby had the chicken and waffles.  Bacon in the waffles?  Are you kidding me?  He enjoyed it, but only ate half.  I would like to go back and try the BLT bloody mary.  I love bloodies, but wasn't quite up for it that morning."
5798,Hash House A Go Go,4,Food was great!!! The serving is almost good for 2 people . The price is pretty decent $15 for the burger and $18 for the chicken w/gravy. The food  presentation is really nice and food is really good! The place is ok could use some renovation from the chairs to tables and carpet. Our server was nice.
5799,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Out for breakfast on Veterans Day honoring my husband who is active duty and decided to come here! What a disappointment, we expected a wait but a whole hour after being seated and still not receive food had me beyond pissed, Seeing those come after me and have plates angered me more. Finally after speaking up the food arrives cold and hard. I immediately asked for a manager who much help I'd never come here again. I'm too upset to eat I had an upset toddler and 3 other kids who I allowed to eat just because it's been so long. Have had such bullshit service in a long while."
5800,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Ate at the Vegas location in January. It was packed but the food and the service despite the crowd was on point, absolutely delicious. When I go back to Vegas I'll be back there too!"
5801,Hash House A Go Go,5,"DELICIOUS!!! 
Although even if you go at 730am there is a wait, the line moves fast. 
It's on the second floor at the Linq hotel and you can tell hash house is a popular spot. 

I had the spicy grilled chicken sandwich and my fiancÃ© had the sage chicken biscuit. Both were out of the world delicious! 

The servings are huge so we were able to pack half my sandwich to go :) 

The grilled chicken was juicy and flavorful and the fries were perfect. 
The flavorings were really great and even if I was full, I couldn't stop myself from eating. 
The spicy aioli sauce was delicious with the sandwich and the fries and it was finger licking good.

My fiancÃ©'s chicken biscuit was just as good. The cheese with chicken and the biscuit and eggs made everything amazing. 

Only if there was a hash house near me in NY..."
5802,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Big servings of decent food but *wow* is this place just always packed or what. It was an underwhelming experience overall. Also, some of those weird little people-with-speech-bubble decals on the way up the escalator are kind of weirdly offensive. On the other hand, if you look closely, one of them contains a secret code you can give your server for 10% off, so ... eh? I mean, you could do worse, but it's Vegas, so that's not saying much."
5803,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I initially had no idea of this place's existence until we suddenly passed by it after waking up from a long night of drinking. It's really hard to not miss it because it's upstairs and there's construction going down below. You might want to come early because a lot of people come here! I ordered the country Benedict with fried chicken, and whoa! It was one of the best dishes I've ever had. There's a spicy kick to it that's just right and not overwhelming. The chicken was moist, and crispy. The mashed potatoes underneath was out of this world. Their orange juice was the best I've ever had. The server was great, to a point where he said I was the 9th person that he served that actually finished the whole plate. I don't know whether that's a good thing or not but I think it is! It was worth every penny! And I'll come back here on my next visit!"
5804,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Awesome food at reasonable prices! They serve giganormous portions, so if you don't eat a whole lot, think about sharing! Our wait to be seated was expected to be about 20 minutes, it turned out to be a ten minute wait, so I was impressed. We came in on a Monday (Mon. before Thanksgiving day) and it was surprisingly busy! 

The ONLY reason why I am giving this review four stars is for the sole reason that our food took a while to come out after placing the order, AND was it loud at that place, pretty incredible. But what can they do? Tell everyone to shut up? You just have to suffer through it! No biggy though."
5805,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Solid breakfast. The service is great. 15 minute wait was more like 10 minutes. Try the vanilla waffle. Super fluffy and solid flavor, but really big. Overall good place to get breakfast on the strip."
5806,Hash House A Go Go,1,"Charged an extra $20 ""bagging fee"" on Postmates only to get my order wrong. The bacon and mashed potatoes suck. Fried chicken is good. Everything else stinks. Go somewhere else."
5807,Hash House A Go Go,5,Great place for the entire family. Just come hungry because you will not be able to clean your plate.
5808,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Be prepared to wait! Luckily the wait for two is usually around 20 min if that. The pancakes are huge but delicious. The hash is pretty amazing. I think the biscuit was my favorite part of breakfast, light and fluffy with awesome strawberry jam."
5809,Hash House A Go Go,5,"BLT Bloody Mary?  YES PLEASE!

Nothing better than a bloody mary for a cure for the hangover.  ALWAYS love my toast on the side with a Bacon dipped right in my Bloody.

The Sage Chicken here is also so good!  I personally don't eat the garnish but the leeks that's on top is drizzled with a maple syrup reduction that makes me sad once all the leeks are all gone.  If I could lick my plate I would."
5810,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Just had a great meal and even better service from
PJ. He was working hard in a packed restaurant like LeBron heading to the basket. Food came out fast and was delicious. Can't wait to come back again, would highly recommend. Thanks again PJ!"
5811,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I've always wanted to try this place every time I go to Las Vegas but never had the chance until my 3rd time. This restaurant is a popular brunch place in Vegas and its usually quite busy. When we went initially on first day in Vegas at 9AM, it was already super packed and there were already lineups before he arrived. We decided to try another day so we went on a Friday but earlier at around 7:30/8 and we were able to get a table. This restaurant typically has some very unique signature dishes including the Chicken and Waffles which the 3 of us ordered. The food was massive & delicious. The waffle was fluffy & little crispy. The chicken was quite flavorful, moist and crispy. The overall dish was just huge that I couldn't finish it all and had to get a takeout box. A very touristy place for lunch but a must try brunch staple for anyone visiting Las Vegas. Staff was friendly and the ambience is very trendy. Highly recommend it!!"
5812,Hash House A Go Go,5,"I LOVED THIS PLACE!!!! I'm a fan of HUGE, filling portions and this place knocked it out of the park for me! Yum! Yum!

We were a party of four. We ordered the Eggs Benedict (Man V. Food Favorite), Chicken & Waffles, Eggs/Bacon/Apple Cinnamon Flapjack Combo, and Fried Sage Chicken salad. Everything was just amazing. The pancake was pretty light and fluffy despite its massive size. It literally filled up the entire large plate and was about 1.5 inches thick. The waffles were dense and cooked perfectly. The Eggs Benedict came with a very LARGE split biscuit + a MOUND of perfectly seasoned mashed potatoes. The chicken for all the dishes was very good with the sage seasoning and had an amazing crust. It took me three separate attempts to finish my dish. 

It was about an hour wait for 4 people on a Friday morning. But it was worth the wait. The food took awhile to be cooked and brought to our table, but when we saw the massive size of the food, cooking time has to be lengthy. Great location inside of the Linq hotel. Excellent value for what you get. Great ambience. Great experience. Highly recommend."
5813,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I always believed that there was no way you could cook a bad breakfast but know it can be done.  The ambiance of the restaurant was good the service sufficient but the food especially for the price was well off the mark.  My wife ordered one of the scrambles with Swiss cheese, bacon onions with grilled mashed potatoes all of which were served at best Luke warm, surprising as we were told it may take a while as everything is made fresh.  There was very little seasoning in any of her dishes.  I had one of the hashes which could best be described as stuff slightly sautÃ©ed and added to a mound of hash browns, again not much seasoning.  The worst part of the meal were the biscuits large doughy chunks that we barely could start much less finish. I'd take my worst Waffle House experience over this. Really disappointing and at the prices charged borders on scandalous."
5814,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We stayed four days in Vegas and ate there twice!  Yes, it was wonderful - really impressive seeing your truck load food coming and food so tasty.  They really understand taste buds.  Great hamburger.  Great meatloaf breakfast, great chicken breakfast (weird).  Really affordable American cuisine."
5815,Hash House A Go Go,5,"If you want to go here for breakfast you should try to make a reservation.  They get really packed in the morning, which is when we went.   We did not have a reservation, but they put our name on the wait list and we went down to the casino to gamble a little, which was a fun way to pass time.  Overall I don't think we waited more than 30 minutes. 
The food was phenomenal. First a I got a s'mores cappuccino.  It was delicious and fun to look at. The capaccino was covered in toasted marshmallow fluff and gram crackers. It was the best coffee I have ever had.  For the meal I had the chicken and waffles.  The meal totally towered over the plate in the best way possible. The chicken and waffle were cooked to perfection and the syrup was a perfect addition to the meal.  
If I make it back to Vegas I will definitely be going back here."
5816,Hash House A Go Go,5,"EVERY time I come to Vegas I go to hash house. The best food in Vegas hands down. Portions are not human and prices are excellent. If you want something original and delicious, MAKE THE TRIP. Oh and breakfast ALL DAY at THIS hash house! Never gets old!!!!"
5817,Hash House A Go Go,4,I was barely able to walk out of this place.  Beyond Full.  Huge Servings.  Even their blt bloody marys are a meal in themselves.  Lots of mash potatoes..biscuits.  Everything besided your main food is there to fill you up.
5818,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Favorite place in Vegas! Service & food are on point! Hate waiting in line, but the food is totally worthi"
5819,Hash House A Go Go,1,"I was craving breakfast at 100pm so we decided to go to Has House A Go Go at the M Resort. We were there last year, and now I remember why we haven't been back since, service was bad! Last time we were there, service was sooo slow, this visit wasn't any different. Mind you, the place was not packed considering it was a Saturday but maybe because of the time. My drink didn't come out right away (I had the tri colored lemonade (watermelon something)) but my husband got his immediately. For the main food, he got the famous Andy's Sage Chicken (as featured on Man vs Food) and I just ordered the Tractor Driver Combo. I asked to have my eggs ""over medium"" as I hate to have runny whites (that's just me). It took FOREVER for the food to come. The waitress never came back to say what the hold up was. So after what seems like an eternity, the food came. His food is good, but mine, well, I had to ask for new eggs. I told the waitress I wanted it ""over medium"". She gave me a lecture on how over medium means the yolk is still runny, I said I understand but the white part on my eggs were still runny (I showed it to her on the plate; when I cut the eggs, the white part were still liquid and this was practically over easy). She said she'll get me a new one. The waffle, on the other hand was good, except the little tin cup of syrup was placed on the waffle itself. Not such a good hygienic practice; how do I know where that thing was before they stuck it on my waffle! When we were done paying, the waitress places the black bill container on our table, no thank you's, nothing! At that time, my husband and I just looked at each other and said, this is the reason why we haven't been back! Now, we will NEVER come back, EVER! The food may be ok/good, but the service was horrible!"
5820,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Extremely crowded on a Saturday morning so unless you have time to wait or can squeeze into the bar area (as we did) good luck! This place was absolutely delicious I opted out for the chicken and waffle plate. Two people could share this dish let me tell you the plate was huge, drinks were average but this will be my go to breakfast location one day out of each visit I make to Vegas! Definitely a must try location"
5821,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Always read and heard reviews about this place serving up good breakfast. So I decide to stop by one morning for late breakfast while in vegas. Got here early and put our names down. Within the next 10 minutes or so the place filled up quickly and there was a long wait. Couple of my friends were running abit late so they didn't seat us since all the parties weren't there. So we kept getting pushed back till my friends arrive and they keep calling other parties before calling us. We were furious plus it doesn't help I was so hungry prior to getting there and one of my friends husband was on his lunch break. So the wait ended up being almost an hour, and the food was mediocre at best. Seriously? I got the waffles with eggs and the portions were pretty big but they tasted plain and  nothing special other than their portions being huge. But I prefer quality over quantity, esp vacationing in vegas. 

ehhhhh next stop!"
5822,Hash House A Go Go,5,"A good overall experience brought us back here again for 2 total visits in one vegas weekend trip. The wait was worth it both times (15 and 45 mins). Portions are huge, unique and delicious. Almost every entree has some sort of unique twist. Chicken n waffles were damn good as well as the bacon avocado scrambler.

The place has a industrial yet clean, with a modern look and feel. The service was energetic  and attentive. I would definitely plan on coming back and plan on visiting the Chicago location near me in the near future."
5823,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Very good food made from scratch... And man do they sure give you a ton of it!  The menu had so many options, it was really hard to decide.  The servers were very friendly and attentive.  Breakfast hit the spot and I saw a handful of items on the menu I still want to try, so I'm going to attempt to get back here again soon!"
5824,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Had to try the chicken and waffles because that's what people talk about. Impressed !! It's definently a shared meal unless your starving . Atmosphere is nice , waiters polite and sociable . Only knock I had was we were waiting on people from our party that was down stairs parking and they didn't sit us until everyone came . It's the policy . Must try tho when in Vegas ."
5825,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Quad location is actually open ""24/7"".  Yelp hrs wrong.  Good breakfast (corned beef w/eggs).  Fast and fresh!  Also have fresh squeezed OJ.  Left a star off for coffee that was just ok and heavy/dry biscuit."
5826,Hash House A Go Go,5,"LONG WAIT TIMES, with that said food was good. Service time once we sat down was excellent.  Our server was on it, constantly checking on us without making it uncomfortable."
5827,Hash House A Go Go,4,"First time coming here, the platters are HUGE. Some people left with more than half of their food uneaten. Lots of famous celebrities come here, usually the wait is not too bad but coming on a holiday we had to wait 45 min to get seating. Order to share if you want to save room for dessert."
5828,Hash House A Go Go,4,"WARNING: MASSIVE PORTIONS!!! Plan to share unless you have a HUGE appetite. I'm a big eater and couldn't finish my dish! 

My group of 6 came for brunch, and the worker at the front told us that the wait would be 45 minutes. Expected for a popular place at peak time on a Friday. However, to our pleasant surprise, we were seated in less than 5 minutes, probably because they happened to have a big table cleared! 

I ordered the red velvet pancake with the trucker combo (includes eggs and choice of protein - I got bacon). When the food came out, I was surprised at how massive the portion was. The pancake was literally the thickness and size of a cake! I worked my way through 70% of the pancake and had to give up so I wouldn't get too much of a belly bloat before going to a day club pool party. It was pretty good - the red velvet flavor was distinct, and it was well made. However, I wish that it was slightly more crunchy. As my friend put it, we'd rather have 3 thin, crispier pancakes, than one massive cake-like pancake.

We came back here for a night snack a couple days later after not being able to get back on the main dance floor at Omnia (ugh why do those night clubs never cap entries.....). I shared the dessert red velvet waffle and ice cream with my friend, and at 2AM, it was the best snack we could ask for. We both with that it was slightly crispier, but it was still a very satisfying snack."
5829,Hash House A Go Go,5,Portions were outrageous.....got 2 meals out of the flap jack combo (brown sugar bananas). Everything was delicious down to the homemade biscuits.  Reasonably priced for being on the strip as well.  Expect a wait in the morning hours but we'll worth it!
5830,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Went here for breakfast on last day of our LasVegas trip and it was a great way to end a great weekend. I had the basic eggs and smashed potatoes and it was very good. Hubby had a scrambler and he said it was the best. The bacon was very tasty and plentiful. We both follow Paleo so we were grateful to find a place we could eat and not have lots a yucky fillers and such. Our waitress, so sorry I missed your name, was upbeat, helpful, friendly and a pleasure. Prompt with coffee refills and taking away dirty plates. Yes, the portions are huge and yes there was a line of people."
5831,Hash House A Go Go,3,"Interesting menu. Had the breakfast burger. Actually very good

Went very early so no one was there. Hard to tell full atmosphere- but Christian behind bar was a hoot."
5832,Hash House A Go Go,5,"We tried going for breakfast, but the wait was too much for us and we were hungry!  The place is open 24 hours, so we went back at night and the food....INCREDIBLE!  The portions are ginormous - neither one of us could finish what we ordered, but good god, the food was good.  The service was spot on as well.  Best fried chicken I've ever had - hands down."
5833,Hash House A Go Go,5,Amazing food like your grandma makes!  Go with an appetite.  Many of the dishes can be split and you still can't finish it.  Unbelievable prices for serving sizes.  Delicious hash!!
5834,Hash House A Go Go,2,"So disappointing!!! Came in because I heard great things, read awesome yelp reviews, and the menu online was enticing. We had monorail passes so getting there was easy. My husband and I both decided on the hash since it's what they're famous for. I'm a foodie and almost always order what a place is known for.... it's supposed to be the best choice, right? WRONG! First of all, the hash is not a hash, beware hash lovers. It is large chopped crispy potatoes with stuff on top. I got the corned beef hash, and it was literally breakfast potatoes with shredded beef on top. I was hoping for the delish smushy goodness of everything cooked together in a hash.. and it totally fell short. It was also served in a cast iron skillet that it wasn't even cooked in. What I really wanted was their vegetable ""hash"" with corned beef added to it. But they wouldn't let me... which I found strange. They said I could remove things but couldn't add anything. I didn't care if it cost more, I just wanted veggies with my hash. But nope. I also ordered they're ""famous"" blt bloody mary which also fell short. It was watery from the first sip, and I really didnt understand the giant lettuce and tomato in it. To top it off my hash arrived incorrect, 3 times. The poached egg, although cooked in water, was cooked to a rock. It came with a biscuit when I asked for unbuttered toast. And then the toast arrived with butter. I'm allergic to dairy so there really wasn't any ignoring it... The server asked to take it back again but my husband's would have gotten cold.

The two stars are for the glass that I got to keep from my drink and for the server taking my meal off the check. Unfortunately, I don't understand the hype this place gets and I won't be coming back..."
5835,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Hash House A Go Go is hands down my favorite place to go in Vegas. It has the remedy for hangovers and gambling busts. The food is great and the price is right. The portions are large but more importantly the food is fresh. Homemade bread for sandwiches, homemade biscuits for sopping up gravy or golden egg yolks from farm fresh eggs. This last time I tried the chorizo hash. Housemade chorizo piled on top of crispy fried potatoes with onions and peppers, all nestled under two eggs over easy (or any way you want them), and a biscuit snuggled into a skillet (instead of a plate). It was absolutely delicious! Don't go to Vegas without stopping here! Oh and now its 24 hours!!!!"
5836,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Cool to try because presentation of food and portion sizes are unreal, but nothing tasted good and the service and ambiance left much to be desired."
5837,Hash House A Go Go,3,I tried the chicken and waffles at the Sahara location and it was just okay but I gave the place 4 stars because the drinks are amazing and the portions are huge. Since we stayed at Imperial Palace and I decided to try the infamous sage fried chicken eggs benedict and.. wa wa what a disappointment. The biscuit is dry as hell and the chicken was dry. I wish they just covered the entire thing in ladles of hollandaise because it was so dry! I got the orange crush drink which was pretty tasty. It's basically just riesling and orange soda. Worth $9? Perhaps not but I wanted to keep my buzz going. Will I go back? Nah. I think I'd rather just have my breakfast at Ellis Island :)
5838,Hash House A Go Go,5,I was worried this location wouldn't be as good as the one in town but I was pleasantly surprised. We had a little wait (40 min for 7 people) but it was totally worth it. The food quality was spectacular. None of the other 6 people had ever eaten here before and they all can't wait to come back. The olives for the bloody mary was stuffed with jalapenos for extra kick. My HH original benedict was as big as my head and sooo delicious. The fried chicken is unreal and the biggest surprise was how perfect the quesadilla was. It was spicy with crunchy fresh jalapenos. I will be back my next trip for some more belly busting goodness!
5839,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Came for breakfast at 5am so it was not busy but the service was so slow. I had to flag the waitress every time I needed something. Ordered waffles, eggs and sausage. The waffles were barely warm.  When I informed her that she doubted me. Waffles should be hot otherwise it's not good. I asked for a pancake instead and she had to ask someone if that's ok.  I spent an hour there and didn't even get a refill of coffee.  Breakfast was over $20 and wasn't even mediocre...never returning there."
5840,Hash House A Go Go,3,"The portions are so big here you can easily share with another person. This place is kind of hidden so follow signs correctly.

The wait was not too bad for us but others experienced otherwise, maybe because they had a bigger group. Smaller groups get seated quicker. 

We had food coma for the rest of the day beware LOL!"
5841,Hash House A Go Go,2,Waiters was horrible and the food is really overrated...only think is good about it is that they give good portions of food
5842,Hash House A Go Go,2,"Is it worth the wait? No. Is it overrated? Yes. 
Portions are large, and prices reflect that. 
Don't expect hash browns."
5843,Hash House A Go Go,4,"Vegas is known for being extreme.

The gambling, the casinos, the people, and most importantly, the food.

The days of the $9 prime rib dinner has been replaced by Michelin rated establishments charging $85 for a steak and French pressed coffee going for $9 during brunch.  After a day of eating very well, we decided to hit Hash House because I had heard about their insane platters of food as well as creative takes on classic dishes, such as the Eggs Benedict, for example.  We came here for an early dinner since hiking in Zion takes the most out of everyone and we had not had a decent breakfast beforehand.

The menu is diverse with many options so make sure to make your selections.  I settled for the Stuffed Meatloaf, my friends ordered the Bone-In Ribeye and their infamous Fried Chicken and Bacon-in the batter-waffles.  This joint is not lying about large portions.  The Fried chicken and waffles were a good 14 inches high stacked, and that did not count in the sprig of rosemary on top.  My stuffed meatloaf dinner was actually two huge slices of meatloaf sandwiching a mound of delicious melted mozzarella cheese, red peppers, and spinach.  The small hill of mashed potatoes was a creamy and packed with butter.  My friend's Ribeye was done perfectly and the meat tender to cut into.  While I found his mashed sweet potato concoction interesting, my plain mashed potatoes would have tasted better with his entrÃ©e.  The Fried Chicken and Waffles are the sure bet here, however, since the chicken was moist and done right with the amount of spices.  The waffles were also very good, crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  The bacon bits in the batter were also a nice surprise.  My meatloaf was good but lacked flavor, almost as if they forgot to add some sort of seasoning to the mix but everything else on my plate was great, right down to the green beans on the side, which picked up the slack.

I was going to opt for one of their stuffed burgers but when the waitress stated that it was part of their policy to cook them medium well to ensure they would be cooked thoroughly, I decided to pass.  I prefer my burgers medium rare.  

If you have never visited, do so at least for the experience.  You won't regret the visit, not to mention the selfie photo ops.

I'll make my way back for something different on their menu next time and bring a larger appetite!  Their breakfast items sounded like an adventure!"
5844,Hash House A Go Go,3,"SPLIT AN ENTREE!!!!! Unless you can eat 4 big mac meals in one sitting, then order one entrÃ©e to yourself.  Pig.

Pros: 
24/7
Fast food, 
comfort food
large portions

cons:
Gets busy (b/c it's good)
service (they aren't the brightest people that work here) 

I came to this location inside the Quad around 3am and was told we could sit at the bar or wait 15 minutes to be seated in the dining room (which we could see was not seated at all) but okay so we sat at the bar.

Ordered the Sausage biscuit: Basically Biscuits and gravy with chunks of sausage over a bed of mash potatoes.  Yum you say.... yes YUM indeed.. however as I was eating this mound of mush (minus the biscuit which wasn't visible but was rock hard) I didn't eat one piece of sausage until I was 1/4 don't with a rock hard biscuit... 

My boyfriend who started at the other end of the plate, got a million pieces of delicious sausage and didn't eat any biscuit until he was already full. We both discovered the mash potatoes when our pants were going to explode.  

Since this was 5th meal (literally) it did the job and put us to sleep.

Service here sucked.  but food is always solid."
5845,Hash House A Go Go,5,"Good food and great service. Big portions. Shared Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict with my husband, and we didn't even finish it."
5846,Hash House A Go Go,1,Overly loud drunk large tables of 20 something males and people were complaining and getting out as soon as possible.  Waitress blew it off.  Manager should have intervened!   Not a pleasant experience!
